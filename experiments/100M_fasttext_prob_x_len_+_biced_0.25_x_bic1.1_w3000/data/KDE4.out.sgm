<seg id="14">"each object is represented by a rectangle, whose area is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in & FSView, the size reflects the size of a file or folder, the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can easily be detected if they are far below the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView may be considered as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX command."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the Treemap representation is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your file system. for easier navigation, the rectangles have meaningful color and labelling settings."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either be depth for easy recognition of the nesting depth or the representation of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the various properties of the respective file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether it is displayed at all, only if there is enough space to display or if the area of subordinate rectangle should occur. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for Treemap in & FSView, the rule should be maintained that the area is proportional to the size of the entry. frames are drawn to display the nesting of entries, and this frame requires space which is then no longer available to subordinate entries. note that less space is lost for the frame when the rectangle is quadratic."</seg>
<seg id="20">"as distribution of the area of an entry for the subordinate entries takes place, the implementation remains up to the implementation. in this context, it is always preferable to divide the surfaces in such a way that rectangles are created that are as square as possible. the best methods in this regard are rows, columns or recurrent divisions."</seg>
<seg id="21">"instead, a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the orderly entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>

<seg id="71">"raw file support: if you are using the raw mode of your camera, it can be edited; the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menu Help."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh decoder Settings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"an easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digikam; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the photo2 library. of course, any medium and any card reader, supported by your operating system, will work with & digikam; work together."</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transmission. for the actual transfer to the computer the camera is often used as a USB mass storage device. the connection can also be realised via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"& digikam; uses gPhoto2 to communicate with digital camera. gPhoto2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports the Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely used protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripherals without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">"many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transfers over the serial port are slow, this connection is now outdated. & digikam; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of pictures with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link."</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgPhoto2 must have been created with libexif support to reliably read the thumbnails of digiKam. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not be able to see thumbnails or the generation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things on & digikam; is how easy it is to extend its functionality by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">"KIPI modules: the KDE Image plugins Interface Project (manual) is a joint module structure for & digikam;, KPhotoalbum, ShowiContacts and Gwenview. the goal is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section."</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way a user can. their advantage is that it is much easier, & digikam; by writing a small module to complete a function, when the changes are made in & digikam; even perform."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the side bars with & LMB; remove or switch to full screen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"drawing and dropping pictures works everywhere: you can put an image in another part of the Albenbaums, above the horizontal divider line or another application window. the only limitation is that an image can not be stored in keywords, data list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"- a file type selection allows you to extract the most common types: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, Movies and Audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">The text filter is used only for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view. so the filter on the file name only works if this ind it symbol view is also displayed. which fields can be displayed in the dialog of the AlbenSettings.</seg>
<seg id="85">"the view & quot; My Albenlistequot; provides an organized view on your photo albums. all photos, which are edited by & digikam, are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted by the folders in which the album was created first. the date can be changed in the properties of the album."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan an album import images. you can also add a screenshot directly to an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop there. in the then appearing menu, you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album."</seg>
<seg id="88">"an album contains a collection of photos and the album properties allow you to enter information about this collection. to access the album properties, you need to right click on the album and select the album properties menu in the context menu."</seg>
<seg id="89">"album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you use will be used to sort your photos by collection. if you want to add or delete new collections, you can do this in the collections for collections."</seg>
<seg id="90">The album date: is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums sorting by Date.</seg>
<seg id="91">"buttons elder, average, new: these set the date to the oldest, newest picture or section of the album. to this end, the average of the images from their EXIF information is first tried. if this fails, instead the date of the last change of each file is used in this folder."</seg>
<seg id="92">"if you first select an album in & digikam, the first image in the album will be selected as a symbol for & quot; My Albenlistequot; this should help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="93">"to select another photo as an album icon, select the picture with the right mouse button and select" "Add as album preview". "in addition, you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol."</seg>
<seg id="94">An album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">& digikam; supports the input of keywords for single photos in the area My cue list at the bottom of the main window. album collections have a different effect. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the image window will show you the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures in this album will be displayed in the picture window. each photo is shown in a preview, you can adjust the size of these preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar."</seg>

<seg id="150">"the first thing you need to do and know before you install anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure. your image files must somehow be organized on your computer. you must decide whether you want to save them to a reserved drive, or to switch to a larger drive."</seg>
<seg id="151">"you may be happy with this structure. vacation pictures can be found quickly via your location unless you were in one year several times in the same place. if you make enough photos, you will use subfolders such as & eg; 2008-01, 2008-02 & etc. export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a web page."</seg>

<seg id="155">"we also recommend to save the metadata option in the Settings page of the metadata in & digikam; this ensures that EXIF and IPTC data are written into the file. if you forget this, you can subsequently save the metadata from the database into the files by selecting the appropriate item in the Album menu."</seg>
<seg id="156">"now you have a lot of information in your database, but what happens if you want to change which ones?"</seg>
<seg id="157">"now the real work begins, as you should now assign every picture, words, captions and a rating. of course you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value. this makes sense, since you can focus on the best photos in the further work."</seg>

<seg id="239">TIFF is widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files. a problem however is that this format has been adapted by many people. there are therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG is a licence-free and open raw image format developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is developed on the basis of the need to unify the image formats. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already using DNG and we hope to use the competitor Canon and Nikon even sometime.</seg>

<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, comparing, automatic trimming and contrast extend from the menu Correcting Automatic corrections attempt automatically to make your colors the best. you will have to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scaled the brightness values over the entire image so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or washed away.</seg>
<seg id="391">"same: this method uses the brightness reactor of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes the comparison achieves very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only garbage. it is a very powerful operation that causes either miracle in a picture or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic trimming: this method maximizes the color range in the red, green and blue channel. it determines the dark and light border tones and adjust the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram range."</seg>
<seg id="393">Augmenting Contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the largest possible area and a re-adjustment of all values in between. this is only visible in well-balanced images and can be a good correction for bad photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">The white balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photograph.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is somewhat limited as a color space with 8 bits per color is used. if you can thus far from the original image can be removed, areas with overexposure can occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by the copyright of Pawel T. Jochym. you start it using the menu item colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, both the original image and the preview of the target image can be seen. preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, then click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">Thumbnail preview has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"the histogram shows that dynamically changes as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels are very small luminance values. with a button you can decide if one of the three colors or your sum is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadow, saturation and gamma. the Shadow Adjustment allows you to improve or digest the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the picture preview to use the selected color to calculate the color temperature of the white balance. this way, the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of presets. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The exposure indicator increases the colors if more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result in white balance. this is indicated in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the Save as and Load buttons do exactly that. any setting of the white balance you have set can be saved to a text file, and load it later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button resets all filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in another picture than your original. if you save them, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG formats."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool will open the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color tones mapping can be carried out by the subwindows for brightness. a detailed guidance for using color profiles allows you to consult the chapter ink management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool can be found in the menu under colors tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time and allows you to use them for several photos. this is useful if your camera or scanner always needs the same error, so you always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">"a very powerful way to correct exposure issues is the tool for gradation, that you can find under colors gradation in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="410">"& digikam; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar installation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"the coloured, darker areas protected the sensitive photopapier from the additional light. this had the effect that the brighter areas were darker and the colors were inverted by the second illumination. the result was a partial negativity of the image. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the solar cell. at approx. 50% intensity, the image shows what is possible chemically. finally, another upliftment creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photographic paper."</seg>

<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquoth; effect. it differs from saturation by having a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, he beautifies many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slide repetitions the strength of the neon light. for large images, the filter can relieve the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is therefore not unusual that you want to correct the color contrast and luminous intensity of the photo. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. you can view all your settings in preview.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: one to large saturation. in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex tool gradation and the simple chid strength / contrast / gamma, the tool toner correction is located for improvement of exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you only need the area of the slider for the purpose described here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders are clicked into which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digikam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpness is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but it is created especially in dark areas, granular images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"sharpness mask is working on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper. actually, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psycho-audiovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric dunst and it makes a really good job here. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">"refocusing is possibly the best of the three, since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters to adjust."</seg>
<seg id="483">The same phenomenon can be observed when color spots are printed on paper. the same phenomenon can be observed when color spots are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG pictures, a camera has often been used for internal sharpening. however, images in raw format must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a sharpening filter while reading the image. if you disable it, you will get control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can get useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. this can be done with the menu item Correcting Door."</seg>
<seg id="487">"however, you should handle this carefully as the results do not work very naturally: the sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also strengthens the noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image intensifies the tool. under refocusing, you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques for sharpening."</seg>
<seg id="488">"sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool to soften the soft character and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unclearly masking is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and preview will help you edit the picture. the preview window will show the filter output with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tested first. an increase in the radius or amount will amplify the effect. if you make the sharpest mask to strong, noise and the impression of grates will create near blurred edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">"the radius turns a like many pixels on each side of an edge being affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii. therefore, you should best sharpen pictures in their final resolution."</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fracture from the maximum RGB value and the difference amount to be applied. thus, a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded and therefore beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">This is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2).</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digikam; tool refocused refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyright-protected design filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filming. the traditional technique for sharpening images is using a blurred mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular folding works much better than the Gauß'sche fold. the Gauß'sche fold has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixel, which is far from the original quellpixels, which causes unwanted results in most cases."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular folding. it is the most important parameter to use this module. for most pictures, the default value should result in 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for the correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in noise filter can help you reduce artifacts. the filter can assume values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality is very poor."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter when your sharpness is Gauß. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value nonzero, you may also have to increase the correlation and / or noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in matrices size can produce good results, especially if you select great values for this parameter. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Store buttons are used precisely for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise you should use the module, before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations that are not immediately visible are not immediately visible, but which later leave unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, & eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">"generally, blurred Maskieren produces better results than sharpness. this could be caused by blurred Masquerade a bigger neighborhood than sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in theory, the result of the FIR Vienna Filters is always at least as good as the sharpest mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">"below you can see a comparison between the different filters, applied on a small unfocused image:"</seg>
<seg id="511">The original blurred color pattern needs to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the methods of sharpness correction in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English at this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob smooths the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the colour ink allows a customized color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can set it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove undesired artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS laboratory in Caen / France and is part of the Cimg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restauration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to a uniform smoothness over the image. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening is necessary afterwards. please note that the detail maintenance should always be subordinated to the direction dependency."</seg>
<seg id="520">"directional dependency Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value is flattened to 1 only in one direction. if you have a film grain or CCD imaging, a high value will create wavy-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best removed from 1 value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"smooth [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above all. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more is smoothed."</seg>
<seg id="523">"repetitions: indicates how often the algorithm is going through. normally, 1 or 2 is sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle range da [5, 90]: angular-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if alpha is selected small, it should also be selected small. make sure that small angles generate a long term. thus, you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral increment width [0,1, 10]: integral increment in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel-smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">"use linear interpolation: the amount of quality that you receive by selecting this option is only modest, but it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to omit it out."</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load buttons are doing exactly that. correcting any image errors can be saved in a text file and reloaded later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and pull a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time using the Cancel button."</seg>

<seg id="530">The & digikam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Moireacute; -effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>

<seg id="534">"in the following, you will find a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow Details and the Advanced Settings sub-window can remain in the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is needed per pixel and can wipe the image. the area indicated by the radius is smoothed over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore smaller bugs are cleared."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing of the filter to the front to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter can no longer receive image details and noise or forging happens again."</seg>
<seg id="537">Edges: controls the edge accuracy for sharpness. this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong can't remove the entire noise or noise peaks can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing any details.</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance density of the image. we recommend that you change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the image through the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we advise you to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process of the image controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gamma resonance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically stronger. however, it also lubricates the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls the alignment of the phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of luminance. if it is elevated, the edges appear smoother, if it is too high, noise and phase jitter may appear on the edges. it can remove stains and is the recommended method."</seg>
<seg id="542">Save and load: these buttons are used for this purpose. all the noise reduction parameters you have set can be saved to the filesystem and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2). the noise reduction was applied with the default settings.</seg>

<seg id="566">"& digikam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image."</seg>
<seg id="567">"wide angle lenses, in particular those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor range evenly. instead, & quot; vignettierenquot; (shaded) they reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the aperture filter, which makes it impossible to keep the camera with the hand. wide angle lenses should also use a center filter, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise blurred effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure areas of today's film and color or gray scale of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a Centerfilter. the tool vignetting corrector applies the transformation with a Centerfilter to a picture. the algorithm is protected by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three regulators, you can check the vignette filter filter and with three more exposure of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light intensity attenuation at the point of the largest density of the filter. the standard density is 2.0, which means an optical filter with a lens aperture of 1, or randomly a brightness of 2, reduce it to compensate for a small degree of vignetting."</seg>
<seg id="572">"brightness, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you have to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options."</seg>

<seg id="576">This tool works with geometrical distortions. colour distortions cannot be corrected using this tool.</seg>
<seg id="577">The coefficient of the second degree covers the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the concave or convex shape of the image.</seg>
<seg id="578">"the coefficient of the third grade has a similar round effect, but flaws at the edges. this correction is not applied in the tool."</seg>
<seg id="579">"the coefficient of the fourth gradient corrects the distant corners to that of the second degree. if you combine these two, any geometric distortion can be almost eliminated."</seg>
<seg id="580">"in general, this value controls the strength of distortion of the second gradient. with negative values, barrel-shaped distortions can be corrected and positive values cushion distortion."</seg>
<seg id="581">"corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth. this value appears more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'corners parameter' has the opposite sign of the parameter 'General'."</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resets the image size and thus corrects the first gradient. negative values increase while positive image decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">Lighten: this value adjust the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it.</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog box illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start."</seg>
<seg id="585">"the key or cushion distortion should be performed before any changes or size changes. the best way to do this is to perform this correction as the first one. if you cut a picture anew and then perform a tonne-like correction, the effect would be apparent falsehood."</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal auxiliary line. move the mouse pointer in the image preview to display the dotted lines. move it to an important location, such as the bottom of the sea or a building wall, in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point."</seg>

<seg id="856">"you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process. the first option decides if the camera settings should be used for white balance. the main parameters such as gamma, brightness and red / blue amplifiers can be adjusted. if the result is not optimal, you can edit the image later on."</seg>
<seg id="857">"a four-colour RGBG conversion can be selected, so you can use the contrast information. if your camera works in RGB mode, the RGBG switch has no effect."</seg>
<seg id="858">"once you are satisfied with previewing, you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result. the filename will remain the same, and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly. JPEG uses a lossy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes."</seg>
<seg id="859">"tagged Image Format, TIFF, keeps all information of your image and uses lossless LZW compression."</seg>
<seg id="860">"if you plan to edit your images frequently, or to continue using them elsewhere, you should not choose the JPEG format since it only allows a limited number of operations before image quality deteriorates. TIFF and PPM are better adapted to keep the original data."</seg>
<seg id="861">"if you select JPEG as a memory format, the metadata that is included in the RAW file is stored in the JPEG file in the Exif information."</seg>
<seg id="862">"if you have adjusted your settings, you can start the conversion with the Execute button. if you want to cancel this process again, you can use Cancel."</seg>
<seg id="863">"batch processing mode allows you to convert various images at one time. therefore, use this mode if you are sure, e.g. by testing on a single image, which are the best settings."</seg>
<seg id="864">"the available settings are almost identical to the version for individual images. however, they have the possibility to overwrite existing file automatically. however, this is useful if it was created in an earlier attempt. however, a preview is not available. the progress bar shows how far the conversion has progressed."</seg>

<seg id="921">"last but not least, you can choose which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this way you can avoid that information is displayed that is obvious to the viewer without a description. for example, that all pictures are from a party."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this section, you can define how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unambiguous, which is why they are not specifically addressed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images. thus, those who view your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution of 800x600 may not download images, for example, have a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you specified. so, it can browse your images with low resolution, leading to a lower transfer time. if you want to get a picture larger, it changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setting, specify the different folders and the URL where your website is stored."</seg>
<seg id="926">"for all your HTML files, select a base folder and create a new subfolder for each subsequent set."</seg>

<seg id="933">"there are two different types of .kim -files, internal and external. they differ in the fact whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of all images in the file is that you have all the images together and that you can share this file independently. however, the obvious downside is the file size."</seg>
<seg id="934">"you can either export a .kim file directly from File Explorer... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file along with a HTML file, this will be an external .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="935">"an external .kim file searches the images in two ways. first, it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .kim file. if the corresponding pictures are not found, this is only possible if you have created your .kim file using the HTML export."</seg>
<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access through the File... Export menu."</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option for this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kim files. the following three choices are available:</seg>

<seg id="939">With option Automatically close to .kim file Copy & kPhotoalbum; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">".kim -files are normal zip files. since most pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small, it is usually not worth compressing the files."</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is maximized image size. if you send images to your friends, you may not want to send the images in full size, as the .kim file would be very large. for example, you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide."</seg>
<seg id="942">"if you select a file with the extension .kim from the web browser or from the File Import menu, select & kPhotoalbum; import the exported database as described in."</seg>

<seg id="944">"it may be that you will personalize the category of persons belonging to the imported file (if you are a Dane) while this category is called persons. therefore, in the third dialog window, you will be asked which categories of the imported file to be imported and which categories these are in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported into the categories of your current database. for example, see the image."</seg>
<seg id="946">"it must be easy to browse and view images: if you look at images, you often want to jump within different picture groups & mdash; for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy vacation and discover an image with your friend on it, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted."</seg>

<seg id="960">"the applications using the modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules work with & kPhotoalbum; this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications."</seg>
<seg id="961">"the biggest difference between & kPhotoalbum; and other applications that also use KIPI, is that the other applications can arrange their images in albums: an album is simply a folder. even if & kPhotoalbum; this kind of order is not supported, it simulates for some modules the order for albums so you can use the functions with & kPhotoalbum;"</seg>

<seg id="1042">"these images often have a Moirè pattern or tier effects in curves and lines, and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel in the display. this effect is called aliasing."</seg>
<seg id="1043">"& Povray; uses a technique called anti-aliasing to reduce the impact of these errors. generally, pictures with this property look better."</seg>
<seg id="1044">"if you turn on anti-aliasing, compute and connect & Povray; more than a beam per pixel. this technique is super-sampling."</seg>
<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard, an adaptive, non-recursive method; adaptively because the super-sampling meets the adjacent pixels."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray follows a ray per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a certain additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, at a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixel is calculated as follows: R 1, g 1 and b 1 are values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold, the pixels are divided into 4 sub-pixels, which are separately tracked and checked for further subdivision."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another possibility to reduce the aliasing effect is the generating of noise for the ray process called jittering. if you turn on jittering, change & Povray; the beams around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last adjustment for the quality of rendering is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; the diffuse light reflection computes. it takes a long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>

<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression ratios for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for more parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">'--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces and has already high quality. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality.</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. requires up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good pleasure for music by young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be exaggerated for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want to have the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">The & CD; information that is manually entered or fetched automatically from freedb via the internet is available in the program as a list of parameters. you can pass / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files.</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the & CD; title to the keywords (English: tag) if MP3s are encoded with lame, the -tt of lame and the title parameter of & kaudiocreator must be added; the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= click of a button in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"this is what the freedb is: a free database where people can read / enter the audio CDs, so that all others can download this information instead of themselves into the computer. it is to be noted that here only text is spoken: & CD; title, artist, name of the pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translation: this is meant by the author) am not attorney. however, no one can prevent you from being harmed by the & CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can be harmed."</seg>

<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror-server is to be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirrored servers for the online retrieval of & CD; information while reading a & CD; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) only the updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which reading program is used to save pieces from the & CD; into wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumors that cdparanoia is used; those who want to know more exactly, search in the source code.... This has always been the best choice for reading audio CDs; see also note that the cdparanoia package must first be installed from the appropriate distribution if this is not yet done."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"in the first opening, predefined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) can be added to the encoder tab. other encoders can be added on this tab."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodierer package must be installed by the Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoders. more information on encoders can be found in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, more information can be obtained via its switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)." lame "must be replaced by the name of the installed encoder."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"check the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, read and read real on it and whether both cdparanoia and audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;) are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1541">Check if you don't want to read a copy-protected audio CD; check the cover of the & CD; this will not work!</seg>
<seg id="1542">"there is a chapter with a step by step example. even if you use other settings, you can give tips on how to proceed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">"in this example, we will start the program for the first time, setup everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bit rate) from 224 to 256 kbps on average and ID3V1 keywords (tags)."</seg>
<seg id="1545">"there must be cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be found as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. an appropriate package for lame can, for example, be found with a search engine, as it is not considered completely free software."</seg>

<seg id="1550">"although we can change these settings at any time, we will most likely not change them every time you read a & CD; once the appropriate settings are found."</seg>
<seg id="1551">The device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the & CD; -data / pieces.</seg>

<seg id="1652">"this is absolutely necessary for synthesizers, which are not general MIDI. in this case, the MIDI-Map translates general MIDI events into events that the synthesizer understands."</seg>
<seg id="1653">"for example, you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to Bright Piano events into events of the Change patch to Trumpet type and will always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"if you have only one sound card, you do not need MIDI-Map, because all sound cards are GM -compatible (including Awe - and GUS cards, FM devices and so on)."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"there are no programs to create MIDI maps, so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand (with your favorite editor)."</seg>
<seg id="1656">A MIDI-Map is a text file that stores all required conversions for playing a piece.</seg>
<seg id="1657">"each section may only appear once, except the keymap section which may appear as often as desired. however, the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has a different text id (see below)."</seg>
<seg id="1658">DefectPATCHMAP... END Define keymap "Name of the keymap"... END Define Keymap "Another keymap..." END Define CHANNELMAP... END OPTIONS... END</seg>
<seg id="1659">See that Define is needed to indicate that a section starts (except for OPTIONS) and END that the end of a section is reached.</seg>
<seg id="1660">Please send me your map file as an e-mail so that I can offer in future versions of & kmid; support may be for devices that are not general MIDI-compatible.</seg>
<seg id="1661">This section shows how the patches of General MIDI are mapped to your specific keyboard. the general use looks like this:</seg>
<seg id="1662">"please note that the left side of the sign is ignored. it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order (from 0 to 127), so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of the 128 instruments."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the optional Allkey To M is used to lay all the sounds that this instrument needs to put on the note with the number M. if your keyboard does not support a gun signal (GM-Patch 127), you can use a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun signal."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so if a MIDI file is to play a note with Patch 127 (gun shot), it takes 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"please note that the term" "drum patch" "means that each sound is a different percussion instrument (drum, cymbals, maracas & etc;) and not the one in which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to specify how sounds are displayed on a specific channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of lines is very important as well as their presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several key maps for each channel and each instrument. you only have to use different names in the first line.</seg>
<seg id="1669">"keywords are used, above all, to map sounds on the percussion channel. see the provided keymap as an example."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to swap the first and the second channel, simply make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are more useful for keyboards that have the percussion on a specific channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need 16 or 9 channels)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, built according to the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"n is the channel that is shown on the Channel N. if you use the keymap option, the keymap is used with the name Name for this channel. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events that try to change the patch on this channel will always be ignored."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"for example, the ForcePatch option can be useful to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio will indicate in which pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so if a pitch-Bender event sends a Pitch-Bender event with the value n, this will be converted to the formula n * (r / 4096) and then forwarded. the value 4096 is used to avoid decimal commas in the map file."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM is pretending that a keyboard, which is supposed to play a pitch-Bender event with the value 4096, will play a tone higher. unfortunately, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you have to try a bit with & kmid;"</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of keyboards (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are currently being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a specific channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button is no longer green but red to indicate that no more the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the channel view has two different views (up to now) two different views to display the sounds played. in the Settings menu, select the channel view settings:"</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the tempo-LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc. this allows the same MIDI file to perform on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can't force anyone, & kmid; to use. but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, the speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; that happens because & kmid; without AWE support compiled. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example by kmid; 's start page)"</seg>
<seg id="1686">"I'd like to add a whole folder to a collection, but I have no desire to add all files individually."</seg>
<seg id="1687">"OK, support & kmid; drag and drop. just open the folder you want to add in & konqueror;, select all the files, and drag them to the & kmid; window."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"previously, enable automatic addition to collection. otherwise, the files will be added to the temporary collection."</seg>

<seg id="1691">"if you want to listen to a file only quickly without adding it to a collection, disable automatic addition to collection, and the new; file is added to the temporary collection."</seg>
<seg id="1692">"let's assume you have MIDI files A.mid, B.mid and C.mid. First you just want to play the first file. so set the setting Automatic Add to the collection and open A.mid. your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file."</seg>

<seg id="2043">Igitt! is that an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in connection with this symbol? let us replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>
<seg id="2044">"to create a symbol that represents the action better, we will use & kiconedit; choose from the & KMenu;, Graphic more programs (or where else it is located in their distribution)."</seg>

<seg id="2057">Perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus; for the normal user it is possible to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language you like best. that's why this chapter describes how I create a PHP; documentation tree for my personal use.</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before you start your own documentation, you might be in & quantaplus; -Repository if someone has already done that for you."</seg>

<seg id="2061">"the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, you can see now in the & PHP; documentation like this:"</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config File [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = Basic syntax,... Basic syntax = language.basic syntax..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the box depth (except through reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">Note that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and consequentially at the top of the tree view & mdash; folder displayed!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces don't influence anything but pay attention to & & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & lt; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus; resource files.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the content section is the range of the docrc file, which is used to design context-sensitive help. for example, when writing a PHP; script, the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function should be displayed. by checking the function name and pressing Ctrl; H for context help, the documentation would be displayed directly."</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of text-separated context elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your docrc file to $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc or $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / doc for local or global use. then create a folder (as specified in your docrc file) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation there.</seg>

<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work on XML languages currently not supported by & quantaplus, but it can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is a simpler way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me explain briefly why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer has changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in merging."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program I used showed me only the changed lines, but I couldn't see what had changed inside these lines. and there was no indication of the places where only the indentation had changed. the merging of these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could show differences within a line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to quickly compare text, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was to compare and merge folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a full file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">"this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously displays the expected result. in this editor, you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:"</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you to merge and merge the complete folder. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; file merge:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; shows the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's colour monitors. if you often need to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white characters and tabs are shown visibly. if lines differ only in a certain number of white characters, one can see this at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more irritation when somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, then the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both of them differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can ease typing work by simply writing the file name of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Folder 2 kdiff3 Folders 2 Folders 2 Folders 2 Folders 1 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -o target folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">"the opening dialog enables manual typing of filenames, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. the opening dialog shows your selection and shows them next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C blank, the analysis of the differences will be done with two files."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"click the folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the merge or merge of folders is initiated. if for A a file is selected, for B and C however a folder, then use & kdiff3; file name from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"when merging is enabled, the input field is active and can be edited. however, it is not mandatory to immediately set an output file. you can do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Configuration button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before you start merging / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. the comparison starts immediately. in the opening dialog, you do not need to select files, you can close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: simply drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"what thought is behind it? sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, this would be a relatively big effort."</seg>

<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping of text into another program than cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source window contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that Windows C is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, then a small help window will display the full name.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. a has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed using the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a difference is recognized, you see at the color which file is different. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is in the next section (merging) well."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"when differences are found, the column displays the corresponding color. if differences are found, the color shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (in C / C + +, for example, white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare individual cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line separating the summary column of the text is interrupted in places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line is dotted with broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (below the comparison window) also has an info line with the wording edition:, the filename and [changes] when you have edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">"!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe buttons for the next resolved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"if only two comparators are used, each difference is also a conflict which needs to be resolved manually."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"by clicking with the left mouse button in the summary column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or manually editing; then, in these lines the text & lt; No row in the source file; this is only a placeholder in the event that you change your opinion, and maybe paste another source. this text will not appear in the final saved file, or in any mark you might copy and insert somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="2313">"the text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard, if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function."</seg>
<seg id="2314">"note: if you select Ignore numbers or Ignore C / C + + comments enabled when selecting the sources, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white characters."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"navigate mainly with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys on the left, right, high, down, page, Siw as you are used by other programs."</seg>

<seg id="2335">"this is useful when the selected file is used as a source. (default is manual selection.)

<seg id="2345">"this selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences will be displayed in a color coded Overview column. but sometimes you may want to see only the differences between two of three files. after selecting A & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; -gt; C or B & lt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt; & gt;</seg>

<seg id="2348">"sometimes you see the differences and then suddenly decide to merge the files together. merging the current file in the merge menu also works if you only compare two files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the file name of the last source file as default file name.

<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it will first be passed to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command becomes visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that meets your requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it will first be given to this external command. if a normal preprocessing command has been specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this preprocessing command."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility in setting up the Diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl is sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2352">"use this preprocessing command for newlines to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\ (. *\\)\\\\\\\ 1 /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2353">"CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add generated strings (info: / cvs / keyword substitution). thus, a pre-processing command for newlines is required, which removes the automatically generated text: SED's /\\ $\\\ $\\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\ $\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>
<seg id="2354">"while you experiment with sed, you may start to understand it and perhaps you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in Kdiff3. but it is good as an example of another preprocessing command for newlines. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' ['and'] 'is a hit, and every hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi cleared."</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e 's / REGEXP / Replacement / SCHALTER' However, perl needs some details. where sed\\ (and\\), perl needs only (and) without the preceding '\\'. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2358">"the data after the normal preprocessor are retained for viewing and merging, and other operations only change the data that the newline algorithm sees."</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases, if you use a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor will see the output of the normal preprocessor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally not notice certain differences and, in the worst case, destroy important data."</seg>

<seg id="2957">"the system V Init is rapidly becoming the standard for controlling the start-up of the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful, and more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go into historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know anything about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the Init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because perhaps someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without re-installation and reformatting. the & Linux; kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init differs also from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.d. Dort, you will find rc.sysit and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which only starts once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"on your part, rc.local should be on / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also use rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following in the beginning area:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look into the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change that, then you can edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3. if you have messed up, then you can fix it by rebooting the system and running the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does all the scripts then start? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry here is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"how to start and stop init system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line, like this:"</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it includes an S, the script will be called with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people desire a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could & eg; a server runlevel, which only runs httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc; runs."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running levels to start it on this level (resp. stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between runtime, or alter the position within a level by moving it somewhere else. this will only happen if they extract an entry from the domain of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved when you move them into a new area. to copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to recover records that have been thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tab key to activate the various workspaces (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it to the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the button to open the Properties dialog. use the tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before running."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. presets are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be recovered by & ksysv; changes to the preferences are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
