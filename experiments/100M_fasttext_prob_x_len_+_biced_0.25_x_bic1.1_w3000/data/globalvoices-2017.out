although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 I would live there for the first time .
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is exceedingly great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , had been dancing to American music , read American writers and practi@@ sed his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington as he played the Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who wanted to fill the mur@@ der@@ ous conspiracy of an oil @-@ magnet with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest . &quot;
I was trapped .
&quot; according to Method Man , &quot; I was as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA had only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had written a very black@@ ish love letter about his great@@ ness .
then Donald Tr@@ ump came .
much was written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascen@@ sion is for me how he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; with his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain , as one says so beautifully . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks , as a former colleague put it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , Af@@ ro @-@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Repub@@ lican prim@@ aries was the highest number , a candidate nominated by the party ever . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked ? &quot;
I could not reconci@@ le Tr@@ ump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix .
&quot; for example , my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , which receives people from all over the world , a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump &apos;s view of the world did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current publisher of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati In@@ quir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; there is also a contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still adap@@ ts to the commitment of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es , who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew Le@@ ak@@ ey , Kath@@ ry@@ n Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values represented by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tr@@ ump made his way to nom@@ inate Repub@@ lican presidential candidates , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; however , it turned out that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly white , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tr@@ ump , because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the pump elec@@ tors as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to classi@@ fy people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities will not be taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tr@@ ump because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , did they perhaps want to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
maybe . maybe .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down on those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( M. B. Ü ) : as much as &quot; b@@ anning the wh@@ ites against all other ethnic groups &quot; ; pu@@ zzling white in allu@@ sions to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the big Van Jones called , has just killed what America has made so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have , America is welcome everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ an@@ er , whose history , as he says himself , nowhere else could be possible anywhere in the world . &quot;
&quot; however , with the choice of Donald Tr@@ ump , there is a huge part of the White Americas on this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is again at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump , would my son , Captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; no ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared .
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they answered . &quot;
do Af@@ ro @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried , and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; would anyone , who is not like you , have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tr@@ ump , this is not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is now Tr@@ ump Land , the message said . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find any place in this new America . &quot;
and this breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children do not let their love of music spoil by rub@@ b@@ ish

what is the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ah together ?
&quot; the fact that the music played at both places has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists - but worlds away from the nearby pre@@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous kitchen . &quot;
&quot; for some years now La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music ban@@ de ) has been playing in the congregation : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero &apos;s community in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , which is located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs . &quot;
but this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare ray of hope .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they get out of school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laughing and with gl@@ itter@@ ing eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn to play trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , forest horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from waste
&quot; more than 7.@@ 000 km south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero , the children of C@@ ate@@ ura are playing a village located on the top of the largest land@@ fill site of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ manufactured instruments , which consist of local solid waste materials , produced in a workshop dedicated to musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ur@@ as , where the recycl@@ ers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , contra@@ bass@@ es , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all made of tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music from the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in Los Angeles Times , Fa@@ vio Ch@@ á@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and musical teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ur@@ ah , re@@ members at the beginning : &quot;
first it was very difficult because we had no place to rehear@@ se and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the tr@@ ash . the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children .
this changed when Fa@@ vio had shown something he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments from re@@ processed material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( harmonic waste dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of waste each year .
&quot; those who live with him and him are the poor@@ est - like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn it into something beautiful .
land@@ fill harmon@@ ics follows the orchestra with its inspir@@ ational play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing
photo © F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that focuses on international , practiced solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re @-@ release takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices to share content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already pursued illegal fishing in Liberia &apos;s waters before picking up the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species on its coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ ores , Mozambique and the Seych@@ elles were rapidly mobili@@ zing themselves against the ship . they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything , &quot; &quot; re@@ members Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior employee of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : he was unable to catch fish there . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia , due to the pl@@ under@@ ing of fish stocks in the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which inter@@ sec@@ ts criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; alongside Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to detect it . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; by the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while actions against illegal fishing were once obstruc@@ ted by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the s@@ nail stamp , with the information circul@@ ating between individual countries , the actions nowadays happen in real time , with track@@ able on F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , such as suspi@@ cious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
&quot; fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea , using satellite data . &quot;
this makes it possible for the authorities to identify vessels fishing in prohibited areas - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships .
&quot; ideally , such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a pen@@ al code . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of this information , countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports . what does that mean that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about substantial financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm which supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the aforementioned platform has been created to regain an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenues , which the eight members of H@@ IS@@ H @-@ i network lose every year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region is attracting commercial fishing from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; their practices include , among other things , actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , information of f@@ anci@@ ful names , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; they pur@@ pos@@ efully use the lack of international cooperation and exploit the weaknesses of a completely organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could say &quot; You may not run my port . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and precisely this legal lo@@ op@@ hole is trying to close F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the closed front functions . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 tests of suspected vessels . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has pursued and found fle@@ eting ships .
&quot; with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international agency for the fight against crime , F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i to accurately locate suspi@@ cious ships .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and offers technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Cop@@ eland helps build a system that connects different levels of information . F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i is designed to help identify non @-@ discrimin@@ ating ships with greater precision . &quot;
a model program
but can F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes this . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine conservation organization : a platform that provides satellite data and displays the position of each tracking ship worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; get together with neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study . &quot;
&quot; we should do this at a global level . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable Trust has a similar project to run where a global system allows the prosecution of ships . &quot;
there are signs that F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
&quot; ships , which used to be f@@ ished without a license earlier and hardly had consequences , now know that they are observed . &quot;
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating in F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i have meanwhile recorded a 33 % increase in fish@@ eries turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i had helped to track down Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there tow@@ ing nets where they were forbidden . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we are a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; six countries have joined forces in 2015 , the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are now fighting illegal fishing , according to the exact same model as F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; with certainty the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i &apos;s most recent member state Somalia announced its first major triumph : in October it introduced Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship under false flag . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded in forbidden waters that were reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; with the taking of measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they put a strong signal that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ IS@@ H @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative working method to protect the oceans really works across the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . &quot;

the street movements in Venezuela only seem to be the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are said to be prot@@ esting against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the inaugur@@ ation of President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the Venezu@@ el@@ an government rejected the opposition &apos;s request for a referendum on a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis ran into empt@@ iness by gathering themselves on the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezu@@ el@@ an ( example : the rein@@ car@@ nation of Venezuela ) , pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country , including the Bar@@ inas flat land area , in the An@@ de@@ an regions of Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central @-@ north district of Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and at Is@@ la Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deterior@@ ating , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans through an acute lack of food and medicines . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change during the inaugur@@ ation of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , but in the end , the sec@@ rec@@ y of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ ors to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , sum@@ mar@@ ises the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; within the framework of the social , political and economic crisis , in which inflation and profits are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % for the annual financial statements ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum was considered the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a 12 @-@ hour strike on the following day as well as a march to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace , the Venezu@@ el@@ an government , planned to continue on November 3 , should continue the blocking of the referendum on the National Assembly . &quot;
&quot; the appeal was commented on Twitter , among others , as follows : &quot;
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday nationwide civil strike and on November 3rd all go to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace . &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration in the context of the action programme &quot; &quot; The re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot;
&quot; the images of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify , among other things , an overwhelming participation of the people in many areas of the country , but also disputes with polic@@ emen as well as advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; one of the most commonly reported pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; &quot; will you kill me , because I &apos;m hungry ? &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images that talk about disputes , as well as reports of oppression and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment , are pil@@ ing up on Twitter . &quot;
especially large waves hit the news of police repression in the central @-@ north town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
&quot; there , the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves according to their own statement from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government . &quot;
&quot; hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop the police , including this woman in the An@@ des state T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a don &apos;t wear a skir@@ ts because otherwise you could see something that many National Gu@@ ards don &apos;t have !
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic already makes the round , which depic@@ ts the extent of repression per day : &quot;
&quot; thus , dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country . &quot;
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a legislative procedure - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado asser@@ ts that 1 % of the signatures are counter@@ f@@ eit .
here is your turn of office !

others evaluate these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government that has taken little against the devastating economic crisis and has preferred to refrain from critical voices :
they took us as much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported that they were too hungry to participate in a strike , rather than working or shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take a look at the atro@@ cities committed in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Cór@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; as a mature man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now testified to his father as part of the large La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial in the province of Cor@@ doba . &quot;
&quot; the trial , which ended on 24 August 2016 , was investigated for crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of wearing the same name as his father , to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
he kept the family secret for 34 years .
in the situation at that time I thought that this was al@@ right .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I could not realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was Gen@@ dar@@ meri@@ e@@ officials . during the Argent@@ ine@@ an military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department at La Per@@ la prison from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;

&quot; however , this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and ab@@ duction of a 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ anic &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had witnessed as a boy and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
&quot; his story shows , what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose a path of redemption for himself . &quot;
from sports hall to military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have made friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
just notice that she will not kid@@ nap you one day and I have to save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party of Argentina . &quot;
&quot; therefore , he for@@ ba@@ de me to go to the sports hall again . a few days later he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
he told me I would become a secret agent .
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers belonging to the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; all possible documents were : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; over there the prisoners are tortured , &quot;
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la with - everything in 1976 .
during the first and the last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to get off . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - everything possible . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and commanded me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver in it . &quot;
&quot; on that day , I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were shut off and kept me with a guard . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
over there the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I looked inside , and saw a lying on which people were tortured . &quot;
it looked like a field bed and metal springs .
later on I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there .
&quot; they seldom caught a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it out with water and drove him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts in the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty di@@ aper .
&quot; years later , when my father was placed under house arrest , the same smell came from his room . &quot;
I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible for someone to hurt another person ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wearing ey@@ eb@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; he spoke with &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also tried in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; in the background , I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet . &quot;
&quot; near the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ched sil@@ ently on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; Why do you look so , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you kill me ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told me at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , some rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero gathered and killed a man there .
&quot; according to survivors , the civil servant Jor@@ ge Rom@@ ero , who was also tried in the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , reviewed the students Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , head of the La Per@@ la Memorial , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here their names were changed , and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; when they survived torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought all possible stolen things home .
at that time at the age I had no idea what the &quot; boot@@ y &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was in the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war boot@@ y is a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military signs that you have fought against . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and steal the refrigerator , record player , clothes , paintings , money ... then this is not a war boot@@ y but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the head of the security forces , could participate in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand it .
I was an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal and I replied , &quot; &quot; And you , who ste@@ als cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded with anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and will kill you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anyone else to do that !
my father was like this .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; as I said in the process , I showed a photo from then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll @-@ kn@@ it jum@@ per made of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought home clothes . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defence accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can load me to what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ inable act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
I have children . once you have children you can see the value of a life .
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is false to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you executed people during dictatorship , but why the cor@@ p@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why kid@@ nap children ?
&quot; one day my father brought a girl home , whose mother was killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pets , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I repeatedly asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have put them in jail .
&quot; I guess , it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their bodies disappear ? &quot;
did these people not also have families to whom one could pass their mortal remains ?
the disappearance of the cor@@ pse is the last abom@@ inable act you can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they fet@@ ched machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you &apos;ll never find something , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but of course something always remains .
I have seen how you killed human beings !
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie even myself .
&quot; I just said the truth about 20 criminals , including my father . &quot;
&quot; the idea to show my father was born during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I repro@@ ached him for all the atro@@ cities I had to experience for him .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rep@@ elled and asked myself why all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they supposedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I y@@ elled :
how can you tell me something ?
I have seen how you killed human beings !
you committed terrible crimes and you forced me as a child to participate .
&quot; he replied , &quot; &quot; Well , then show me up . &quot; &quot; &quot;
that &apos;s exactly what I did .
in 2010 I made the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can blame me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally declared against my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 still before the end of the trial .

the Jud@@ g@@ ments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; in Spanish , the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence . &quot;
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera trial ended in August for the crimes against 7@@ 16 victims between March 1975 and December 1978 . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Tribunal handed down life imprisonment and in nine cases sentences ranging from 2 to 14 years . in six cases , there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ imer : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; all the defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police officers and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was kidn@@ apped together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he directed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the judgement is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , representing the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process took more than three years , but the research continued for 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located so that a memorial site could be established that is now being conducted by human rights organisations . &quot;

translation error makes older people in Kyoto &quot; aw@@ ful drivers &quot;
the sign with translation error at a center in Kyoto where you can extend your driver &apos;s license .
the photo was spread in the social media .
editing of the original Joshua Lev@@ ine photos .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend its driving license , last month witnessed a very mis@@ guided translation . &quot;
&quot; in a sign , the Japanese word &quot; &quot; Roll@@ ed &quot; &quot; ( &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; &quot; ) , which means &quot; &quot; older drivers &quot; , &quot; fal@@ sely - perhaps also with malicious h@@ ind thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 , was translated as &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September .
edited by Joshua Lev@@ ine &apos;s original photo in the social media .
&quot; the error was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
the Kyoto @-@ based daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; how could such an English translation come ?
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city , as Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; Hol@@ mes said . &quot;
&quot; the faulty English translation was initially removed . the term &quot; &quot; dangerous drivers &quot; &quot; was replaced later by the appropriate , if not quite correct term &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture has ap@@ ologi@@ zed for translation errors . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are truly sorry that older people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( translation ) , &quot; &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News addressed a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; was denoun@@ ced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the percentage of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country , however , is quite a cause of concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto Pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 were caused by a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 cases of sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a share of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors 1,@@ 80@@ 3 caused a total of 11,@@ 850 crashes . &quot;
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors has risen during the same period . &quot;
&quot; in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the named un@@ named re@@ porter revealed comments to the light which show which prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently hold against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; the article on the translation error , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; so faulty the translation is not at all , right ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a true translation error .
there are not so few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the website En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre bugs in English .

there are many reasons for the wide spread of translation errors .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the target language - should be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as a native language to translate the translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of translation , cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who have no foreign co @-@ workers , can still make translations in @-@ house . then , the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is valued as the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic movements , which are produced by machine translation , show that this technique can &apos;t replace any human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic prints that often decorate shirts or pockets , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least inno@@ cu@@ ous as jewelry , but from large corporations or government that have the means to ensure higher standards , one can expect more careful translations . &quot;
in the future Kyoto uses a more serious source of translations .
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the Internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV websites were no longer accessible . &quot;
other online tran@@ smit@@ ters also recorded footage of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organized by opposition groups opposing the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; the protests started at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament &apos;s duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that Internet sites are locked again by Venezu@@ el@@ an providers .
this is from the page of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; services such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular with the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of turbul@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for T@@ elecommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw this as a &quot; call for violence . &quot; &quot;
&quot; without cable TV and informative national TV channels , I registered again at @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ ton . &quot;
it is amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ ho later confirmed that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online tran@@ smit@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; previous research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a website is blocked by the DNS , the server answers wrong or refuses the request when calling such a website . &quot;
we confirm a DNS spar@@ re : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v ; @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , dis@@ continued the broadcast on Thursday , 6 April , when the V@@ PI@@ TV camera man El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests to Car@@ ac@@ as live , was put into custody . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV again went on show . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia reporting about current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education &quot;
T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a cri@@ mp as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , T@@ ina is fighting for the rights of children and ga@@ thers testim@@ onies of other Cri@@ mean tas which have been the victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report published by Global Vo@@ ices with kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Es@@ cu@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying C@@ ows , falling schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family , who lived there . &quot;
&quot; shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university , she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was proudly talking about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; she , out of which something has become , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as cri@@ mp@@ adi@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay there are more than 46@@ ,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or her minor daughter to another more rich family . in exchange , the child gets food , an education and a roof over his head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children must pay for innum@@ erable days of home@@ work that will never be paid and victims of abuse and mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment can - and all this within the framework of a contract you cannot lift . &quot;
&quot; this practice , called Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay as a result of the participation and acceptance by large sections of society and , in spite of numerous complaints by human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she talked to Cri@@ adi@@ lla - especially young girls - affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ched and denoun@@ ced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , for the feeling of gratitude that cri@@ mp@@ ed the cri@@ mp is generally silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , there is the family , their daughter in the belief that they complete their training , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; &quot; to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who receives the girl and justi@@ fies her exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even star@@ ved . &quot;
victims of the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will be experienced many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never even hear about it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the relatively unknown phenomenon , which occurs in secret in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , was given a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed signs of violent beating . shortly afterwards she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was in the home of the former military personnel Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ ín was living with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , F@@ errei@@ ra hit Mar@@ ín as long as she suffered fatal injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported on the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organisations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go responsible for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there could be &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; says T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without documents , it is much easier to viol@@ ate the rights of children . &quot;
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the Eh@@ ep@@ a@@ ars &apos; neighbours and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a prompt investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás F@@ errei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl , who was her Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; when the case comes to justice , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be a trend @-@ breaking event - if for the first time in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an history a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the Life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his job . &quot;
&quot; their brothers had to work now and began selling sweets on the street or on the market , in order to earn money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only T@@ ina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón in Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
&quot; in the house of her employer , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours every day . &quot;
she had to share the time so that she had time to learn .
she rose early every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers .
&quot; for example , it clean@@ sed the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she was done with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to bring more books from the library of the landlord than eating out of the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iser of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 until 1989 . &quot;
&quot; in some evenings , the landlord Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced him to stand next to him and to read editorial papers like &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to persu@@ ade them not to believe the official media reports of the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they did not often allow me to visit my family , because they believed that I would &quot; &quot; learn bad habits &quot; &quot; again . &quot;
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had made possible , they explained . &quot;
&quot; she was , however , fully aware that she paid for everything she had from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; in school , too , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which is almost never spoken is bul@@ lying and the har@@ ass@@ ment that cri@@ bs are exposed when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately realize that someone who has no parents is a Cri@@ adi@@ ta . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to my home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships develop , I particularly felt that I was not a group . &quot;
&quot; isolation was the worst of all , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
the Society appro@@ ves the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go
&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share job advertisements for cleaning staff and nur@@ ses in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
hello ! I &apos;m looking for a little companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and afternoon .
to learn .
please announce to you .

bill acc@@ uses Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian parliam@@ ent@@ arians recently voted in favour of a bill on &quot; regulating the use and benefits of social networks . &quot;
&quot; when it is adopted by Parliament , users of social media in Egypt need to register with a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be established that is responsible for granting citizens permission to use social media . &quot;
within six months with the adoption of the law users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks .
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring about a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the bill consists of six paragra@@ phs and in local media , including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , video guidance and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not give a clu@@ e about how Egyptian authorities should account for users who do not register , considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ler , MP and suppor@@ ter of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users got a user name and a password from the telecommunications department to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of that , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network . &quot;
but it has not been known until now that such plans exist .
experts on the spot are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research techn@@ ologist at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , told Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they are viol@@ ently controlling physical public and private rooms , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , that means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who are applying for authorisation or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a trial . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not , the draft &quot; is consistent with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in the Parliament , in whose sense the control is maxim@@ ized and ensured that no devi@@ ating nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed legislation against cy@@ ber crime in which a life sentence was fores@@ een for those sentenced to threaten &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; protest . &quot; &quot;

high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq the animal rights activ@@ ist H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists of the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the gh@@ ost@@ ly Persian le@@ op@@ ard .
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger le@@ op@@ ards , which stre@@ aks through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a Par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , it is endangered between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; how Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; is the Persian le@@ op@@ ard the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem , &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predat@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard indeed in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video determines that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wild animals and Nature Iraq educational programs for six years .
she has been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to ensuring protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdist@@ an region .

&quot; in early March 2017 , the daily K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , responsible for nor@@ theastern Japan , has paved the way to rebuild the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atomic accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had triggered the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper is based in Sen@@ dai , which is located in the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was an alleged pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were evacu@@ ated by sev@@ ens because the ts@@ un@@ ami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map .
&quot; in addition to this , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture had a nuclear accident , and alone for that alone , 160@@ ,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; from a local perspective , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o &apos;s special report shows what progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the local residents &apos; lives . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and the survey results of those affected .
&quot; the housing construction in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that by December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses ( for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to record the greatest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , while Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light at 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , six years after the catastrophe , evacu@@ ated housing estates ( for &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; cas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u &quot; &quot; ) were still endea@@ vor@@ ing to reloc@@ ate to final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in homes . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 still 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; nearly 40 percent of the evacu@@ ated Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma evacu@@ ated in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
&quot; like the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of the fishing ports in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of the agricultural land , the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident have affected large areas . &quot;
Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land ; only 66 per cent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent of damaged farm@@ land can be used again in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma .
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farm@@ lands of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the &quot; &quot; nuclear barrier zone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is far removed . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are back at 90 percent on the same level , as before the accident . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only exhibit 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants feel it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ees . she asked them about the state of re@@ building and how their feeling against the ts@@ un@@ ami risk has changed . &quot;
&quot; in its introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami consciousness among the native population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents found that still not enough was done in disaster prevention . &quot;
as it is about those who had to evacu@@ ate Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its edition marking the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ation of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the huge earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also witness to the worst , disa@@ strous , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160@@ ,000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , almost 63 thousand people were displaced in areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 more than 23 000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , were moved to permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; as of 2017 , there are still more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es most of the evacu@@ ees still in homes are older than 50 years old . they are well @-@ known because efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma will have to compete with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when you meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the simil@@ arities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , one often recognizes that one more connects than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast we treat issues that often get less attention when reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we talk to five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .
&quot; Ver@@ oni@@ ki Kri@@ kon@@ i talks about the simil@@ arities of Greek and Turkish ; Tor@@ i E@@ gher@@ man explains how the love of music has consolidated its affection for the Iranian culture ; Adri@@ ana M@@ aci@@ as talks about the time she worked with people from all over the world in London ; and Jo@@ ey Ay@@ ou@@ b looks back on his experiences , which he has gathered in a small village in Madagascar . &quot;

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the man@@ made coma after he was beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday a police officer during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ ana had struck him with a stick against his head . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march across the country .
&quot; Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ ás , suffered from a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on him this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
&quot; the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus , which spread rapidly in Brazil over a few days . &quot;
&quot; on the pictures is also to recognize the face of the police officer , who attacked with a whi@@ p . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás revealed that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o was suspended from active service until the conclusion of the investigation into the incident . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer how he strikes in Go@@ i@@ ana with his stick on the face of the student Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra ( Photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landed on the intensive care ward , his face would be on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ ol@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ ana , shared the video taken by Lu@@ iz since Lu@@ z on the web , where one can see Mat@@ eus being attacked by the police officer , and several param@@ edi@@ cs hur@@ ried to it shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video showing the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , has also appeared in social networks . &quot;
the clip shown below shows the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazi@@ li@@ ans ( approximately 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover a portion of the cost of medical treatment and enable their family to stay in Go@@ i@@ ana while lying in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Gu@@ il@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father because he supervised the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus F@@ errei@@ ra da Silva , who is on the intensive care ward , after being attacked by a police officer who struck him with a stick . &quot;
police gri@@ ps
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only country in Brazil , in which it came to brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers seated at protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for or@@ ators , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to renoun@@ ce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loud speakers . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the whole country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media spra@@ yed street protests by directing the focus on another , unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting a broken glass window to make a photo their Tit@@ le pages illustr@@ atively designed .
&quot; on the other hand , O Glob@@ o fav@@ oured a cover story with a fire @-@ set bus . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if you are strictly opposed to any kind of material damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; ob@@ tains absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate importance , and the typical acts of violence by the military police are covered by head@@ lines with the title of &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the For@@ gotten Villa@@ ges in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Al@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba shut the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , which is located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , despite the fact that there is no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after being succ@@ um@@ bed , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities , until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to invent themselves .
some changed the work .
other res@@ igned and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an who stands up every day at 4 : 00 am , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve him of his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are back in operation after a long in@@ active period , because they have been preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene recalls exactly that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry has already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; by 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are not news anymore . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically dep@@ rec@@ ated , and hardly competitive they became un@@ sustainable for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production targets amounted to 4 million tons . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Cent@@ au@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 Euro ) .
the solution to unemployment ?
the motifs leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price increased over a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar@@ s must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the report published by the OECD and FAO , the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if the current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the present day will certainly go into history , &quot; &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the de@@ commissioning of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
&quot; the same happened in the sugar cane plant Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on May 14 , 2004 . &quot;
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about closing the factory , the word he repeated most is &quot; &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents are of the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was an officially written document , distinguished only in terms of the parts that would be removed , the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could approve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was covered and the letters came more and more frequently . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos Ri@@ ver@@ o was responsible for the factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; &quot; the land had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; &quot; he ass@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , is waiting for retirement in another facility , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction it helped . &quot;
&quot; with each piece he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 working years . &quot;
the best developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important working lat@@ ex was wi@@ ped out .
&quot; in many cases , no alternatives were created for the workplaces and services generated by the communities in which they were . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the Mam@@ mut speech of 21 October 2002 , the former President saw in the eyes of the people present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run smoothly . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or rather , when they began to dis@@ rupt it , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ite the road , this also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; with no work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to search other factories . &quot;
they became spare parts .
&quot; without a future perspective , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area a food factory was created , whose production serves not even for the supply of the church . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests bring the old soldier a pension of two thousand p@@ es@@ o a month to spend the years in retirement in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; Mr. N@@ ene , a man of black skin color , small , with a few teeth and clear voice , is not a supporting person , yet he does not forgive the lies that he told him . &quot;
they have been tor@@ menting him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene is reti@@ ring for 65 years , not because he lacks power , but because he is bitter . &quot;

young people from the First Nations communities across Canada focus on topics that are important to them . they do so by hip @-@ hop thanks to a series of walking workshops .
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014 , to teach youth groups of song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were conducted by educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten Cre@@ e communities and then with the Cre@@ e Hip @-@ Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop concludes that the young participants are scrut@@ ini@@ zing topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago tribe in the U.S. state of Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos;@@ Yo@@ o in the area of the trunk of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a road section in Western Canada , where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered . &quot;
&quot; for the most part , the cases have not been solved . &quot;
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka Cre@@ e First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always rule the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ le@@ oo@@ stu@@ i Cre@@ e First Nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved received a little help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ stars hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cre@@ e . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me
but I &apos;m trying to continue my days on Earth
this is the day when you will take away our cry
because as youth we have lost our way in life
but I believe that we will rise up one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and also advance our youth
so they can do what they intended for the Creator .
&quot; in the comments section , the reader and pro@@ pon@@ ent of the Cre@@ e @-@ language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also contributes and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ ia ( which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; plastic dishes ( for the &quot; &quot; ones &quot; &quot; ) outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

&quot; in Japan , one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu , they are presented in the vicinity of the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( for the &apos; 60s , &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) of any food served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or continue .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago .
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them . however , a new trend turns them into striking cell phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
&quot; at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome , the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
now in special sale : new cell phone bands decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the Ki@@ chi@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly complex .
&quot; in this case , an Em@@ en @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a cell phone stand . &quot;
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a cell phone support .
this part was also produced for the exhibition in Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and that &apos;s just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic .
&quot; some cell@@ phone racks and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or laughing is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; someone who would say : &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form in order to surprise co @-@ workers or family members unpleasant .
our latest cell phone stand has the form of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( O@@ ni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand @-@ rib@@ bons made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; for more bizarre plastic dishes , please visit : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the h@@ ash@@ tag # 1 for the h@@ ash@@ tag # 6 for the &quot; &quot; H@@ ash@@ tag # &quot; &quot; on Twitter . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origins of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry . for example , with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug traffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; in Mexico the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not at all reflect the extent of the human tragedy that ent@@ ails this struggle . &quot;
&quot; the reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the head of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anybody looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each cor@@ pse , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret tom@@ bs , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co has launched the digital project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co . &quot; &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organised crime not only lets us fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear changed lives &quot; ) tells the story of these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ up@@ e , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs for his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father , her four si@@ bl@@ ings , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews in just one day . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task we have set ourselves to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ up@@ e Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electrical shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta said : &quot; it is very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me as well . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are entitled to the insurance of my father , but it doesn &apos;t pay them out , because they demand a death certificate . &quot;
where shall we come here ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; ap@@ render a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , fra@@ gil@@ ity and state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this article from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known disease and sensational journ@@ alism for a number of years now .
&quot; every day I come by newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the pages with pictures , which can actually only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different about it or consider it to be normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old c@@ ousin considers that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealer ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people listen to songs about the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ic &quot; &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they walk through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me , it is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something has happened to them . &quot;
I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statisti@@ c .
&quot; man &apos;s lack of action is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village could be justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; so@@ aked . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to convince themselves that they will be spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still . &quot;
Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the main city district : how a family has been pl@@ under@@ ed by threats . &quot;
&quot; you think of all that you have lost , and how many people can completely change all your lives in just a few days . &quot;
&quot; the pain of this never passes , the trauma will remain , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact you when it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she included her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when to kid@@ nap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these aw@@ ful days whether crying would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega has published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a generation of violence . &quot;
&quot; in the introduction , he raises questions such as : who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime ? &quot;
how is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is an orph@@ an and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , roast potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and make &quot; &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the bottle with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine s@@ cars on his left leg - one for every year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was already past two years before , when he saw only a few blocks from his home , the bloody cor@@ pse of his father , which was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; when Br@@ yan was born , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan was born in 2006 , when violence was viol@@ ated by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Council of Public Safety and the Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor called 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mor@@ de per day . &quot;
these are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; ap@@ render a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose objective is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug traffi@@ cking that has tor@@ mented the country over the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ ING : this contribution and the pages to which he is linked include images on which violence is represented .
fact check is important in a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a for@@ gery .
&quot; but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist further . &quot;
let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its initial publication , it has been mis@@ led to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of image and event - &quot; fake description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample accurate coverage of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for images to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 a tank truck crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , ti@@ pped around and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second @-@ largest country had been neglected for years and rav@@ aged it . the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with pot@@ holes that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the fuel tank collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball rolling dozens of houses including a cinema close by , which was full of people watching the World Cup . &quot;
houses scattered and char@@ red cor@@ p@@ ses scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the unknown .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from the Im@@ g@@ ur user Mysti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example .
it shows rows of char@@ red bodies that are str@@ ung on the ground while people watch it .
but here history does not end its end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media , blo@@ gs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not associated trage@@ dies , especially in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , fighters from the B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an towns of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses dramatically reported atro@@ cities they had to flee from .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; no one stayed behind to count cor@@ p@@ ses , &quot; said a Res@@ idents to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
&quot; the attack remained un@@ resolved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by the B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the image from DR Congo appeared again when it was wrong@@ ly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of mis@@ al@@ ign@@ ments ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the image was presented as a proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one more step further , personal comment@@ aries such as this example mistakenly address the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning report published by the United Nations , those who could flee could flee blows , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against Roh@@ ing@@ ya , posts like the following appeared , bringing together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news page , which was fal@@ sely claimed by President Burma &apos;s Th@@ an being , monks and politicians participated in the assass@@ ination of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from DR Congo to capture this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein Sein to this statement , but had not associated the image from the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide reach of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings date back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; using an &quot; &quot; reverse image search &quot; &quot; you can see how far information can cross borders . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted image search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixture of private sites , social media platforms and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have for@@ warded false reports , some have tried to expose fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of impro@@ per use and linked it to the respective countries , on the basis of which page they were published . thus , we want to represent the reach more clearly than by the language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also linked ) , several examples can be used for impro@@ per use . &quot;
here are some cases that can now be felt completely ( on the orange card ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
country studies of false copy of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
&quot; the orange countries point to pages or servers , which are still available through the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or fal@@ seh@@ oods . &quot;
&quot; gray countries are examples that , according to the metadata and information available through Tin@@ tin , probably also show fal@@ si@@ fication examples . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the picture is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what is happening in Burma @-@ Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Brazil , 2011 . &quot; C@@ ena Cho@@ can@@ te ! &quot;

&quot; one side , which leaves rum@@ ors , questioned that the said photo was Christians killed by Muslims . &quot;
&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City does not only mention the ho@@ ax , but also discusses the mis@@ use of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the people and the trage@@ dies involved ( in DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; en Nigeria Est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; ( In Nigeria , they burn the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article on explo@@ sions in North @-@ Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the district is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( although not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; according to the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre like this one here , who used the image of the Democratic Republic of Congo to illustrate the atro@@ cities of Islam , there are clearly no sides like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who resist this . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the incorrect use of the image since 2011 in connection with Nigeria , then promoted by a post by the US @-@ American , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; Germany , 2017 . &quot; genocide against Muslims continues in Myanmar , Nobel Peace Prize lau@@ re@@ ate remains silent . &quot;
&quot; this article draws attention to the continuing need of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims in Myanmar , but quotes the work of an article by Indian Express with the image from DR Congo ; the article of the Indian Express did not have included this picture at the time of publication of our article . &quot;

this page used the image as proof that Muslims were killing Nig@@ eri@@ an Christians .
this statement was re@@ fut@@ ed by a Greek fact @-@ check @-@ page 2013 and once again in 2016 .
&quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot;
a Association of students of theology ( mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims about the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo .
&quot; Italy , 2015 . &quot;
a resident of the P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o from Tren@@ to posted this news to his site in order to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even in Nigeria , the photo from DR Congo was shown as evidence of the bom@@ b@@ ings of the B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from DR Congo , on the one hand a twe@@ eter expressing sympathy against the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre and on the other the attempt of a blo@@ gger who prosec@@ utes claims that Roh@@ ing@@ ya are being pursued , since the photos were used impro@@ per@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the government of Myanmar has published a correction to what it advoc@@ ated as &quot; deliberately glo@@ ated news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings concerning Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this correction , which has been published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech uses and is used by extrem@@ ist groups to explain that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Bur@@ m@@ ese nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
&quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; cou@@ sti@@ p@@ ect@@ ations &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ? ) . &quot;
&quot; this post , addressed to members of the Russian Orthodox Church , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo does NOT show Muslims to kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
this news page fal@@ sely alleged that the President of Myanmar Th@@ ein admitted being in 2012 that monks and politicians were involved in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image from S@@ ange .
&quot; the article was updated in 2014 , and at the time of publication the picture is still contained in it . &quot;
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by the B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the Kath@@ olische Gemeinde An@@ á@@ lis@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the picture is not written by the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; similar &quot; jihadi@@ st attack . &quot;
&quot; when the picture was circul@@ ated later in the context of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ fertili@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ yu@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the image of the DR Congo appeared , provided with this Twitter h@@ ash@@ tag , and triggered a discussion among Muslims after the massac@@ res of the B@@ oko Har@@ am 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted their communities to pay greater attention to these events , which took place in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; USA , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was t@@ wit@@ ched as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times prayed ) , but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
instead the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do .
&quot; Vietnam ( Indon@@ esian ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message allegedly written by a &quot; father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false announcement . &quot;
&quot; from the Embassy in which the image from DR Congo was included , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ ine Mission@@ aries and Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos distance themselves . &quot;
&quot; there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; Tin@@ tin also points to other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the folder in grey ) , but are no longer fully trace@@ able : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , the Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and date / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have picture file names related to Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010 , the picture eventually bears a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and images
there are two strong issues or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the mur@@ ders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ inations of Roh@@ ing@@ ya by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who un@@ intentionally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; this mood suggests false and false information , that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and de@@ fies the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the dis@@ sem@@ ination of violent ima@@ gery has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that keeping images of a refusal is equal to the recognition of the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even required by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent images can des@@ ensi@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel em@@ pa@@ thy ( such as this study , which examined how violent media work towards helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there are some discussions about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; technologi@@ sts experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; fake news . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something , but what can actually be used diver@@ ted from the context or in completely impro@@ per way . &quot;
&quot; however , each investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how internationally it can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
a blog with the name un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all .
there are such words in each language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
some of these conf@@ using words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others deeply rooted in a special culture ( such as the Spanish so@@ bri@@ met@@ a ) .
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists treat Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird has decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Se@@ aled to your parents in recognition of how they tried to take care of you in your younger years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after getting war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds &apos;s own words from his blog About :
&quot; they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts , and aw@@ aken our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyse and classi@@ fy the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page to publish more of these &quot; conf@@ using &quot; words , showing how different , valuable and impressive these little languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are highly valued by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite words here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka ren@@ ders with the worst floo@@ ding disaster of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and land@@ slide catastrophe in this decade .
&quot; triggered by the mon@@ soon , which usually starts at the end of May , the rivers of Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nile wal@@ a and At@@ an@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have come across the banks in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; following an opinion of the disaster relief center of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and close to hundreds of people are missing due to the floods and mud tor@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; over 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were brought to 304 safe locations . &quot;
the ra@@ inf@@ all started on Saturday ( May 27 ) and the water levels in some areas slowly decreased .
health and hygienic conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
high water in the Ta@@ wal@@ ama town with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users such as A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et deliver regular updates to flood conditions .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floo@@ d@@ lights wor@@ sen the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after further ra@@ inf@@ all are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa Bus arrived in the flood , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle was also flooded due to the water level of Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Air Force provided five aircraft for rescue operations , and another five were made to transport emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages . &quot;
various organisations and startups have also agreed to help .
help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provides important information on flood conditions and humanitarian assistance .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for those who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 8@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if you need help in this field .
the taxi call App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks concerned people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the disaster centre will be informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle for pick@@ up assistance and donations . these were then sent to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross for free . &quot;
they also launched a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floods and land@@ slides .
&quot; the united efforts of the government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , in which several social media platforms are fully util@@ ised , bring people in need for security and provide remedi@@ al measures . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , with the population of Sri Lanka laying the long way to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; the Women &apos;s March on January 21 , 2017 in San Francisco . &quot;
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
&quot; in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and dear friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust in her four years old daughter , she confi@@ des in her children . she is my rock in the burning . &quot;
&quot; in the last minute , we are still calling for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we will sc@@ atter rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the i@@ kon@@ ian image of a woman with head@@ scar@@ f high , tied up from an American flag , others sh@@ atter slo@@ gans against Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people , who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they de@@ pu@@ ci@@ ze me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify ourselves with being a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we all are put in the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective imagination that as soon as Muslims , who don &apos;t fit into it , become Muslim . &quot;
have to be de@@ g@@ lim@@ ated
I don &apos;t stand alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what kind of images do you have in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; when Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and the Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day he died . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western sense , the religion of Rum@@ is was wi@@ ped out , as well as the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ e@@ tion makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
&quot; another is in the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which have already col@@ oni@@ zed Western books for centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting visual language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should be saved .
&quot; in the 1970s , the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid disman@@ tled the story behind these images . &quot;
but these pictures still stand out today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to dis@@ rupt it . &quot;
I have worked in the news industry for thir@@ teen years and I have seen how these powerful and er@@ ron@@ eous narr@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds .
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries in the last three decades , while the US did not even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this narrative will fail to recognise that if French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their scar@@ f in public buildings and Saudi , Muslim women are forced by their government to cover their entire body , which are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
&quot; a powerful group exercises its &quot; &quot; control &quot; &quot; on the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who insti@@ gate movements for change .
&quot; it also sees that the first Muslim prayers were spoken in American soil of Afri@@ cans , which were brought here with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of qu@@ eer Muslims .
&quot; this narrative has kept our collective imagination so deep and fla@@ wed , that often Si@@ kh men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories , which we tell and because of the way in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not only fear of Islam , religion , but it is fear of the &quot; other . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion belong
in the news industry we do more than just tell stories based on facts .
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of the 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims form the &quot; diverse &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than a third of the entire Muslim population are African @-@ Muslim Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims belong to the first @-@ generation immigrants from 77 countries .

&quot; four decades ago , my immig@@ rated parents came to New York to live their American dream . &quot;
&quot; my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics of Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan remembered the sky@@ lines of the world , my parents were un@@ challenged Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now irre@@ vo@@ cable Muslim and American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - rather than bringing out my Muslim recipes or my handy pocket @-@ suit , which all Muslims bear with them - &quot; out of respect for Pep@@ pa W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I am j@@ ok@@ er , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we also need to be no the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be selected almost always for additional safety checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who seek to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced by a well @-@ forged Islam@@ opho@@ bia machinery with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for mis@@ information , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous picture of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger who tears the head@@ scar@@ f . &quot;

I want to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but being a Muslim was only born in my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mos@@ que in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they return to the following terms : belief , behavior and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; maybe my girlfriend , my neighbor , my rock in the surf see that I am Muslims , if it could look through the 15 meter of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the usual ritual with my daughter , when I kept her silent in my arms and whis@@ per@@ ing her Arabic verses to the protection that seal the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
every one of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

&quot; belonging is the image of my grandmother on the mat@@ ernal side with her sisters ; as she has decades ago , a contest of art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see in this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings of painted Su@@ fi saints ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
being Muslim means speaking the prayers that she told me when I had a bad day .
&quot; to be a Muslim is how she taught me to refer to God : God Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who - for centuries - was col@@ oni@@ zed by an &quot; empire , &quot; which established a company called the worthy British Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only master . &quot;

&quot; belonging means to grow up and to hear that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather is crying . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books on modern Islam and about the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept over his family in India , dominated by K@@ ash@@ mir , a family that he could not close in his arms in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have risk the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
to be Muslim means to know that in the last two centuries Europeans have &quot; col@@ oni@@ zed &quot; all the four Muslim countries .
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history has been dropped over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , c@@ ash@@ mir sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , since he led the first mos@@ que in England . &quot;
&quot; even before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I was ever and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to belong to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
&quot; it means remember@@ ing that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops scattered across every continent aside from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue weapons of mass destruction that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy eng@@ ages the USA and the suspect is carrying a Muslim name , the story is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago , the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave called Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country .
it means to name Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I feel when people over@@ crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we stand up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Pun@@ jab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple layers , but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the Nar@@ r@@ ative of the 1,7 billion bears more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing two &quot; we &quot; against &quot; them . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals build structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia on this ambig@@ u@@ ity . &quot;
structural Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in Muslim regi@@ str@@ atures that started with President Bush and extended with President Obama .
it exists in continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of the immigration officer who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that exclu@@ des its borders to people from just the countries it bom@@ bed .
it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; no @-@ fly list &quot; that largely targets Arabs and Muslims .
&quot; it is the wars that we carry and the bombs , which we reject into Muslim countries . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists at the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically wrong image and asked them to judge groups on a scale ranging from 1 to 100 in terms of evolution . &quot;
Muslims were given the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
&quot; we are too deep to embrace the Muslim , or the &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we are decades back to recognize the roots of our fears and the fla@@ wed and dangerous forms of expression , which we dis@@ continue in our news outlets . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; the pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Bad@@ Muslim ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square over black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ H , Muslim , American super hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
and that moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet are now leading the White House .
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years before , they had not yet given them ; now they are ruling great areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the story that I was not aware of when I was so old , as my daughter is now , but who have made me today into an un@@ brid@@ led Muslim . &quot;
things I left here like a bread crum@@ b in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps ar@@ ouse memories , as in all the inter@@ sections our humanity is about , a story may lau@@ de where someone is made to a &quot; &quot; other &quot; . &quot; &quot;

we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why am I telling this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people who have been shown by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in public imagination four decades ago was scientific of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of it , consciously and un@@ consciously to soli@@ di@@ fy the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I did in the rain during the Women &apos;s March because the occupation that we had no President , the chocolate cake pop@@ s , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it begins here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art seeks to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language story@@ telling initiative ( T@@ LS ) , the collection of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the inv@@ alu@@ able blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and honor the diversity of languages of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
&quot; for the makers of the project , the following applies : &quot;
the mass mortality of the world &apos;s languages can be avoided if we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where people don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; while listening to it , it is often connected to &quot; understanding &quot; these events instead &quot; listening to , in order to appreciate , to touch . &quot;
&quot; in this format , story @-@ t@@ ellers read their story first in their own language and translate or explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and their depic@@ tion result in the audience &apos;s audience . &quot;
they ev@@ oke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language of D@@ af@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ nem@@ ara tells the f@@ able of h@@ are and the Pa@@ vian in Sh@@ ona from Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his f@@ able , John Ny@@ am@@ u@@ dam@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his feeling of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; until now , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities and the organizers hope to extend this . anyone who is inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story @-@ telling guides . &quot;
Puerto Rico demands new fixing of public debt from the United States
&quot; with the aim of re @-@ testing the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounts to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group@@ ing &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( civi@@ c front for the ne@@ ural exam of debt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ fixing the debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt are held responsible for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we demand a financial review and a management committee without personal interests in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding compensation , which acts in favour of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
Puerto Ri@@ cos people refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le themselves with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy &quot; proposes a non @-@ profit non @-@ profit organization without party affili@@ ation with a focus on socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to existing state supervision . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of citizens , measures imposed on the outside will be in danger of being rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration carried the name &quot; night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on the digital culture that is hosted in Berlin , an event dedicated to the # Free@@ Bass campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the French @-@ based CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , Managing Director of Book S@@ prints , a publishing house produced by so @-@ called &apos; Book S@@ prints &apos; , read excer@@ pts from the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive In@@ quiry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Sur@@ gical Research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available here roy@@ alty free , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a homage to Bass@@ el and his work .
&quot; in the introduction , it is said : &quot;
this book wants to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what is the real cost associated with this .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who participate in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look over the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
his name was removed from the A@@ dra prison directory where he was sitting on 3 October 2015 .
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current status or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
the introduc@@ tory part of his book with the title Collec@@ tive Rem@@ em@@ bran@@ ce gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom .
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have started to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , deeds and choices . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of at times extreme beliefs ?
the Open Source and digital activ@@ ist web developer has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred to an unknown place from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer , N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; &quot; military police &quot; &quot; Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by persons who presented themselves as the insi@@ ders of the Assad government on 12 November 2015 and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband .
but his where@@ ab@@ outs remain unknown .
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowing for the general public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently the head of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ le &apos;s cultural prototypes was more pro@@ active than the work he began with a group of arch@@ e@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations , and here Greek @-@ Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influence . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work , the IS would put everything on it , to wipe out the architecture that em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but of the world . &quot;
&quot; this expedition into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule , which will be inv@@ alu@@ able to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Bass@@ el has not yet finished this project . &quot;
&quot; N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about her husband &apos;s passion to share his knowledge with others , even during his time in prison : &quot;
&quot; I spent my entire life in dre@@ aming of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the Internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a Pro@@ visional Application she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available licence @-@ free .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here &apos;s an excer@@ pt from the book of Nor@@ a titled &quot; It &apos;s happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens every time you visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink into the world of your lovely eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the senses in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and watch@@ men &quot;
I forget the pris@@ ons of the prison
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; which I carry with me with passion , &quot;
when your eyes say goodbye
and I leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly turned back to my sol@@ itude , &quot;
&quot; to rec@@ laim all the moments , &quot;
and cry and smile about your absence .
I bear witness to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of Bass@@ el &apos;s imprisonment , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year goes by , my soul &quot;
while at the same time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s story is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests in 2011 against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , at least 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in detention according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
&quot; today , we reiter@@ ate our call for the hope that we have to do this for the last time . &quot;
Mos@@ ambique : corruption @-@ convic@@ ted director after release from prison on previous post
&quot; with anger , Mozambique re@@ acted to corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus in which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this was Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and , together with four other defend@@ ants , sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 along with four other defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique , the Council of which was presi@@ ded by Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company which happened on 19 April .
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which evaluated the application , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to resume his old post as the company did not undergo any disciplinary proceedings after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many people don &apos;t like the action well . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , C@@ IP ) , a local institution engaged in public transparency , condemned the company &apos;s decision to put the director back on : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and exemp@@ li@@ fies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary proceedings against the infrin@@ gement .
&quot; however , the company apparently kept silent and did not make appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and considers the case as &quot; &quot; re@@ fut@@ ed &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent type , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had been su@@ cked . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid talks and motiv@@ ational speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped to harm . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za will gladly pay for his silence . &quot;
it is disgu@@ sting !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mozambique student and student of political science in Brazil says the director has no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I can &apos;t believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already massi@@ vely insul@@ ted the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ als to return and to serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served by the state itself . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as if it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man , who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ t prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to recall that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves are in prison Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Mos@@ ambique , but also as sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and , by the way , a proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral presentations was when he energe@@ tically confirmed that &quot; &quot; an ambitious person is capable of anything , even the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it is not so . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious person is criminal at the same time . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also negative : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment , he sat 10 years and was released . &quot;
&quot; and today , the company , in which he de@@ file money , puts it under contract again . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ α@@ Er ( @ az@@ a _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017 &quot;
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from @ Ver@@ da@@ de magazine ( in German ) states that crime pays off in Mozambique :
&quot; indeed , in # Mus@@ cov@@ k Di@@ eb and servant of # F@@ rel@@ im@@ o to be , pays off . # Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , sentenced to long imprisonment , returns to # Air@@ ports of Mozambique - E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo ( @ E@@ mil@@ do@@ vel@@ bo ) May 11 , 2017 &quot;
Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ uses many users wrong@@ ly
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spl@@ its .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the familiar social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although discussing the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or used in general as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; for &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese writing ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word used mostly by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; today Kal@@ ar may normally be associated with racism , but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also posts where they have discussed the use of the word , or have expressed doubts about the purpose of their use . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with different mean@@ ings , which have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , it is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; ( spl@@ itting b@@ se ) , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ar hair &apos; ( Cur@@ tain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by doing a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the proposition ku la - &quot; cure &quot; ( ku ) + the question ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were various reactions to the Facebook initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is of the opinion that she will reduce hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before solving all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook doesn &apos;t delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you are writing on Facebook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the next words .
for example &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ itting shells ) .
the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists who spread hate speech will receive a fairly good lesson .
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all who dis@@ semin@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have proven that the cens@@ orship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative notation of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to share his friends , that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new rule of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours , because the post &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook community standards . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions , or who simply try to show their opinions on hate speech of radical nation@@ alists . &quot;
Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech :
mail without hate speech removed from Facebook .
in the post the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad .
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook is supposed to have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook may have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like &quot; &quot; stools &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the fal@@ si@@ fied posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
Facebook &apos;s automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of mo@@ ck@@ ery among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now laugh about Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts that didn &apos;t contain hate speech , but removed : &quot;
used with permission .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads &quot; I want to sit on a chair and watch pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
only to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post says &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should accelerate violence in the communities of Myanmar in addition , especially in the area Rak@@ h@@ ine where confron@@ tations between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to take control of the ramp@@ ant hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese pages .
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is the end with the child
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the child before is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law to ban this practice so that the age of marriage is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( IR@@ O ) , a group representing the representatives of the various religious groups of the country , said that the state should not interfere since that , age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the Convention on Children &apos;s Rights , the min@@ ors were defined as &quot; &quot; every man under 18 years &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; UN statistics for 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children with 15 already married in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago amounted to 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical Central Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys under 19 were married from 1997 to 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements seeking to abol@@ ish laws for inf@@ anti@@ cide , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hin@@ du leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children before they were to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tension in this actually un@@ complicated thing , and at some point there came doubts as to whether the opposition would agree with the bill . &quot;
&quot; but early 2017 , the draft law against the children was decided - in spite of 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who ab@@ stained , so that he could be discussed in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and announce the law .
one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
&quot; Mr. Sen@@ se Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the draft law against the children of children was voted in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives with 35 votes , and no one was voted against it . &quot;
&quot; having previously decided in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
the majority of social media users were thrilled because the laws were changed at last .
&quot; member of the Facebook member Lov@@ ell Francis , who is a minist@@ erial agency in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk , which has concealed the core of the matter , but do you know what ? the to@@ e is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and that &apos;s almost worth every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson thought it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : &quot;
the law of marriage has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , votes - 35 for this - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; member of the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who openly talked about the importance of adoption of the law , said : &quot;
the age of marriage in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the amend@@ ment of the law passed today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives , there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties and 35 of them were present during the vote . &quot;
all members who were present voted for the law .
&quot; in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , the children were no longer permitted by law . &quot;
it was a long fight ( ... ) child@@ birth sign abuse .
many thanks to all the activists who have challenged him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; however , a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hin@@ du organization in the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal action , should the law be passed and it seems to trigger his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al @-@ wi , an advocate of the law , said it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished that the debate on the subject would be different . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ r@@ ell suggested :
&quot; rather than talking about the problem rather than talking about the problem , rather than talking about the problem , we would say that the state , our daughters in front of it , would speak pur@@ pos@@ efully that they may be mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled males who are facing them , &quot; would you be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; however , whether it comes to a legal action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the child is legally or still the norm in various stages , although there are laws that they are submitting . &quot;

&quot; on Sunday , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s office told Y@@ ar@@ News local news service that they were hack@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can view Wikipedia articles again &quot;
&quot; the English @-@ language Wikipedia page was presented on 18 January 2012 , contrary to the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the United States , internationally dark . &quot;
compiled by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; day after day , it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information . &quot;
both students and re@@ porters and TV series fans defend themselves against the block@@ ade .
&quot; although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy internet users are used to use b@@ yp@@ assing tools for blocked websites ( an up @-@ to @-@ date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN @-@ pre@@ valence of the world ) , most of the ordinary wi@@ ki@@ pedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as described recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ings of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( No. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains locked , there are now several mirrors ( pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform cleared all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. computer host connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;
&quot; despite the legal prohibition , the content is available . &quot;
in a blog post IP@@ FS reports about his efforts :
&quot; after listening to the news ( about the locking of Wikipedia ) , we set out everything to take snap@@ shots from Wikipedia to the IP@@ FS platform . thus , it is possible to read the content in a decentr@@ alized and distributed way . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedi@@ a.@@ or@@ g. &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and only screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website are concerned . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to b@@ ypass the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ isti@@ an Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has produced both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ cyclo@@ pedi@@ .org , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirror sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia . &quot;
Con@@ son@@ ni reported Sub@@ h@@ ash@@ ish Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi - Global Vo@@ ices Member as well as collabor@@ ators with Mozilla at the Pan@@ ig@@ ra@@ hi &apos;s Open Spe@@ aks &quot; pod@@ cast :
&quot; it is not a complete copy of a pro@@ xy address , a mirror . &quot;
one attacks on a different URL that is not the original . that what you see then is from Wikipedia .
&quot; essentially , the server will guide the request to the correct Wikipedia page , so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey . &quot;
this is done by a server that is not in Turkey .

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ ry with poorly positioned motifs and well @-@ balanced colors .
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to bury the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar tries to bring N@@ ept@@ une fauna to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , right next to Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work :
&quot; I live on the edge of the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I was just sitting at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of the Ch@@ it@@ wan Lake Lodge ) suddenly called me . he had received a call from my father that a le@@ op@@ ard would be on the bank of the Rap@@ ti river .
the River dam@@ m is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately started to kne@@ el pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une nature , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he ought to know , for he stood before Tig@@ ern face to face , &quot;
a tiger can not distur@@ b the opinion of the sheep while sleeping ! !
late evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; I too was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the bush appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at us and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife , however , is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist dwell@@ ings . &quot;
see below some of these photos .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ an@@ wal@@ a and originally appeared on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version has been published here as part of a content @-@ sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women with great care must avoid the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband , as well as the fear of the consequences they should desp@@ ise the norm , keep this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian State of O@@ dish@@ a and rejected by her family and the village community after addressing a married family . &quot;
&quot; tradition their wives also do not name their wives by name , is also common among men . however , they have far fewer warran@@ ts to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of the 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states , he is part of the campaign # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al , which is operated by the Community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and advoc@@ ates for the degradation of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; for seven years Roh@@ ini Pa@@ has been working with her video camera to expose clu@@ es , such as children &apos;s marriage , to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected individuals , and direc@@ ts this club . &quot;
she reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them am@@ bass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion , was of women who don &apos;t name their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
she chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patri@@ archy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves .
&quot; the names of their hus@@ bands do not speak lou@@ dly , is a custom that they have all du@@ ti@@ fully uph@@ eld and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not hold this is considered as dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without mor@@ als .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion .
&quot; in the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband in the name of her husband , wanted to try out at home . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini told :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said I should call him hen@@ ce@@ forth by his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started their first discussion with this self @-@ confidence in the luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she all asked , &quot; &quot; If we can &apos;t tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , does that mean they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ist from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about breaking an age @-@ old tradition in which married women never allowed to pronoun@@ ce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini told :
&quot; a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she only ki@@ cked in front of him , and another decided to release all the accumulated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cursed him . &quot;
the expression on her faces was ec@@ static .
I think I &apos;ll never forget it again .
&quot; in the adren@@ aline rush of having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to name their hus@@ bands at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a number of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked which ideas she put the women in his head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she got scared and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini said I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation viol@@ ated violence .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing a zinc @-@ red dot on the forehead , which indicates the mar@@ ital status : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband that I would wear the zin@@ no@@ b@@ red dot , if he would do it too . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing him .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip at every disc@@ us club . &quot;
usually we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to take care of who could hear what they hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in the last months , for the first time in their lives , they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never imagined before . &quot;
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so sincer@@ ely about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things lou@@ dly , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a discussion round , we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing . &quot;
some women in the group have only been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most people this is okay , but some wanted to wear a let@@ tu@@ ce , a wide shirt over a p@@ ant ; they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after a lot of arguments and discussions about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , the morality associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion lap so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will get it . &quot;
&quot; according to the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini affir@@ ms that things are slowly rolling : &quot;
so far we have only done small steps .
&quot; some women tried it a couple of times , but then again stopped telling the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including myself , still do it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red on their foreh@@ e@@ ads .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are in the same boat . &quot;
how to explain raw ini :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I &apos;m too .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman enters the club home and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all in the same boat .

the visit to the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a revers@@ al in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in 1964 in London , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just under five days the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to make the Japanese go crazy . &quot;
people here quickly realized that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail@@ er Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;

&quot; exactly today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and walked across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
&quot; and of course some companies also use the fan base commercially , such as this R@@ amen @-@ Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! &quot;
and what could that be for a day ?

bald men are ab@@ duc@@ ted and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the population that bald men could be target of attacks in Mozambique .
&quot; photo : An@@ ders Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of people for organ traffi@@ cking , presumably for un@@ believing purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called a number of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ lier , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently they admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi are used .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could reveal gold or bring wealth , said the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia of the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of mur@@ ders for obsc@@ ure purposes , are people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led the UN to carry out a mission in the South African country in order to examine this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , particularly in the neighbouring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight against this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who plan to go to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are target ritual attacks , warned the Muslim police following the latest kill@@ ings of three bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ lier , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ ehold Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the bald men .
&quot; persecution and murder of bald @-@ headed individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ ma@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for presumably distra@@ c@@ ting rituals , has given cultural motives and is given by the traditional sham@@ ans , according to which the victims in the head might have power to generate the riches . &quot;
&quot; in the last days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela F@@ errei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha distributed on Facebook the chron@@ icle of the blog poor S@@ nai@@ ppa , who suggested that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I MA@@ CH@@ INE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ME shame a country where people would have shame to demand sex against good marks , work and other achievements , a nation where people would not hurt or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country where people would not suffer from honest pursu@@ its or &quot; &quot; black magic &quot; &quot; aimed at at@@ taining wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some missed the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mah@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter users , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the head of the district Mor@@ rum@@ ma@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ ps , as well as the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald @-@ headed : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are very concerned about the kill@@ ings of bald men . &quot;

we are deeply shocked to experience the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and speak our deeply felt con@@ dol@@ ences to his family , his friends and all those who knew him and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) played a key role in expanding public access to the Internet and Open Knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many from the Global Vo@@ ices community and participated in our meeting in the Arab blo@@ gger in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by people who were self @-@ interested in the Assad government . &quot;
&quot; they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( 01 . August 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a learned from Syrian officials that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we pay particular attention to the creation of Bass@@ el as a pioneer of the open web movement . &quot;
and we appreciate the efforts of all those individuals and organisations that have been campaig@@ ning for his release in the last five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of protests against Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad &apos;s regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , the organization of the Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
&quot; countless of those arrested or forci@@ bly displaced by the regime , are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions . &quot;
&quot; no less than 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syri@@ ans have died in custody between 2011 and 2016 , according to the international human rights organization Am@@ nesty International . &quot;
the fate of many people remains unknown .

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions from the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Prize winners and dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , probably just recently made . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally released on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement with Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dent Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized due to liver cancer , at the end of June . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for &quot; &quot; Subversion &quot; &quot; ( state endanger@@ ment ) after he had participated in the design of the Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China referred to Li@@ u &apos;s case as an &quot; &quot; internal matter &quot; &quot; and told a speaker that he deemed it &quot; &quot; not deemed necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China still receives appeals from the international community , the Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the strict treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has sum@@ mar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
United Nations united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u a treatment abroad . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende have refused to answer questions about the release of Li@@ u .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that it was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were resum@@ ed only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China , as exports were largely blocked since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; after the news had spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
&quot; during the ceremony , Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair . &quot;
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to release Li@@ u and his wife immediately from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top @-@ ranking diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ us as she announced in a statement on June 30 : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift all restrictions of Mr. Li@@ u &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; according to US Ambassador , Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told him that the Americans wanted him to have the opportunity for treatment abroad , in so far as he helped him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced the news agency AF@@ P on 27 June that the embassy asked the Chinese authorities to release not only Li@@ u , but also to release his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Embassy &apos;s request attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley said that China should offer the following to the couple :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice , to which they are entitled to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system , as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a vote in Congress to push the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

Germany and Germany
&quot; Steffen Sei@@ bert , German spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert , wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on 7 and 8 July at the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg .
&quot; previously , diplomatic sources in Beijing reported to the Reu@@ ters news agency that China had great concerns whether the fuss over Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called on China to provide Li@@ u with adequate medical care and to give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ u &apos;s lawyer told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always monitored the room in hospital and that Li@@ u is not permitted to talk and contact with anyone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and liber@@ ate those campaig@@ ning for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France and France
&quot; on 29 June , the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he needs , regardless of where . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that no further information would reveal whether France would eventually receive it . &quot;
Taiwan : Taiwan
&quot; on 27 June , the Council of mainland Affairs in Taiwan called on China to release Li@@ u and show greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
&quot; the Tai@@ wan@@ ese legislature , Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu , of the ruling democracy Pro@@ gress Party , also called on China to allow the sick Intel@@ lec@@ tual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan . &quot;
Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned in a statement on 28 June about Li@@ u and said that many asked him to pray for Li@@ u &apos;s well @-@ being . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 that stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or Land ?
Singapore .

is Singapore a city or a country ?
the question may appear stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice , K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore was to be considered a city . &quot;
this remark has spark@@ ed a debate in the blo@@ g@@ osphere .
&quot; during the meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association meeting , the minister noted that many people critic@@ ised the domin@@ ance of the only political party in Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries . &quot;
he supports Singapore as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy ...
this is what most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing author@@ itarian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country , one hears that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very clas@@ sy : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of that , he seemed inevitably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old ly@@ re appears to emerge from author@@ itarian rulers who pre@@ tend to be democr@@ ats , leave the twisted logic , as it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the responses given by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam last week to his American guests with regard to our press , our judicial system , and our political system were really non @-@ answers . &quot;
he disgu@@ ised such questions with non @-@ answers of rational nature .
Rachel Z@@ eng calls on Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion because she did not understand this conclusion .
personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs to our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
&quot; I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clear up this point , provided he was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore . &quot;
&quot; by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out to the critics that one should start reading the full address of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , according to which Singapore is a city and no country . &quot;
read the full address .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ easy even if we enjoy free and fair elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party winning for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was not a country , &quot; he obviously didn &apos;t mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; Cle@@ ment T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the minister of Justice of Singapore said ...
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I doubt and I &apos;m not even sure if he really believes it , properly associates and is aware of what he is defending . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review dis@@ integrates Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; has Mr Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; believed a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it a Freu@@ dian speaker ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , on which country are the sovereign rights of Singapore going back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally land and city .
&quot; since he plays an important role within the cabinet of government , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of grave importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore make their military service , do they not defend their city , but their land ? &quot;
who does our prime minister have to pay bills ?
what is the value of our pink ID card ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the Journey of a Dec@@ ade magazine tends to be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I didn &apos;t say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
no one ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country especially &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defense of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect in your home or home country ?
&quot; their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series , with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are exposed and a different fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor for Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ?
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I have been living here and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is deemed to be pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; most Canadi@@ ans cook in front of anger when they are held for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little difference between Canadi@@ ans and Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans carry a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when they travel .
everyone loves Canadi@@ ans .
&quot; Americans , on the other hand , ... &quot;
&quot; so it was already when I started travelling around the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tr@@ ump , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried little map@@ le leaves on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we obviously say very often &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country for ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys south of the border .
we Canadian are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much . &quot;
I wouldn &apos;t mind switching to Johnny from Dallas for example .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &apos; nice &apos; .
&quot; first : to be described as being &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means being di@@ lig@@ ently - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has a Canadian Doppel@@ gänger . ) &quot;
&quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , it would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , far away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; I would even go so far , to say that the desire to be free and alone is a major feature of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps simply cool pol@@ it@@ eness .
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence with their neighbors .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dies Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a popular pop band released in Thailand has released a music video showing the jun@@ ta who seized power in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the Band Tattoo Colour describes a young man who tells of what rules his girlfriend does .
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video is indirectly related to the continued military rule of the Jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video to the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times shared and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The Dic@@ t@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand , after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , in@@ trin@@ sic to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these recordings of the videos , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has persist@@ ently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section of 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives the commander @-@ in @-@ chief absolute decision making on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program for &quot; changing the settings &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are viewed by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the image above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear regulations are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army that monitors online content and prosec@@ uted people accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand uses a strict hatred of &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ este &quot; ( &quot; Maj@@ estic Viol@@ ation &quot; ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to do is to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are thrown into a black delivery van before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society , and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut of &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; which was already used by Put@@ sch opponents during the protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Asia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the OC Media website and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post@@ war society only recovered very slowly in East Asia Minor , above all in the T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al district . &quot;
&quot; more than 20 years have passed since the Geor@@ gian @-@ ab@@ ch@@ as@@ sic war was officially ended , but in this part of the Republic its s@@ cars are still strongly visible . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ au@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Asi@@ ans , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together to Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , mostly Russians and ch@@ ases live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period more than 10,000 people lived here ; today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district was 16@@ ,000 people , having barely increased over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3,000 people lived in this district . &quot;

the buildings decay and seldom they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a native elder man .
he starts a conversation and it is hard for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why speak ? &quot;
&quot; it is nonetheless un@@ ambig@@ uous . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were communal centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all of which served the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded gran@@ deur buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
there are about fifty residents living in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ ow@@ kas , which still host one or two families , one recognizes at the balconies , where linen is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in hand , they immediately draw back . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; it simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her girlfriend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and van@@ ishes .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ han@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultiv@@ ating agricultural products for their own needs ) , such as livestock breeding , be@@ ekeeping and growing vegetables . &quot;
it is difficult to come across the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration offers free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez direc@@ ts a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org on April 19 , 2017 and appears here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is run by a 59@@ - year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ ar frame and golden earrings in a ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for about $ 2.@@ 50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
&quot; in the anter@@ oom , there is a par@@ rot in a cage . &quot;
there is no sign for the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian immigrants coming here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells us that people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast begin to cry out : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you Mama Africa ? .
&quot; currently it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some also have slept outdoors on boxes . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to refuse anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they cannot pay , she massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ ch@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if M@@ um Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with their daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a Jo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; they have already lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move north@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard about Mama Africa &apos;s other companions . &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans are often travelling together and that the Afri@@ cans are already talking about Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez &apos;s W@@ hat@@ s@@ app .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et has lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will be in contact with Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez tells that her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet them , or to report her about the course of their journey . &quot;
she explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city is a dead end to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their little house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after living for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ dova Mel@@ é@@ n@@ dez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single educ@@ ator , offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again .
&quot; in the cor@@ rid@@ ors , travelers will calm@@ ly consult their phones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part from Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic because of those who have gone away . &quot;
like a proud grandmother she smooth@@ es her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair @-@ lichen she has made a customer , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sadly while she imag@@ ines her briefly .

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ ang by Twitter users , &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in Western China , are forced to install a spy@@ ware on their phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of Ur@@ um@@ qi got a mobile notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Cleaning &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app is preventing access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities may also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they had installed the app , had exchanged news with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; malicious information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ g &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a service achievement with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u T@@ elec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online , and to remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the ors for min@@ ors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even hack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate the home network of a person or steal from it . &quot;
this introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while noti@@ fications about digital cens@@ orship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to restrict un@@ rest and dis@@ content in the conflict areas , the authorities often impose extreme cens@@ orship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China &quot; ( &quot; &quot; En@@ rol@@ ment &quot; &quot; ) , published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos of a check@@ point where police checked the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang make sure that people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification asked people to install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are discovered at a check@@ point with a device without this software , you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for elderly people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest @-@ keeping technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; in addition , a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , out of which the software can unlock the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive , also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the provisions in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimize the dis@@ sem@@ ination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and related institutions , including universities and research institutes , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent report by Freedom House , an American human rights organization , also mentioned these new monitoring methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Ur@@ um@@ qi an ordin@@ ance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks , and media memory cards &quot; at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intent is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of Ur@@ um@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pun@@ ishments for a whole range of other possible off@@ ences , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; &quot; series where the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane portra@@ ys his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at and realize that you are alone in a place where everything has disappeared . &quot;
everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable from inside and outside .
one that glori@@ fies their name .
one that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but if reality re@@ covers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters are transformed into beings of flesh and blood , and everything cries after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts settle into smoke and you become aware of your existence , even if the earth turns on on the axis of the evil . you realize that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the chief of the security minister said - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five teenagers were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
it was sufficient that the city tore the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all the neighbor@@ hoods were cov@@ eted , but not my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not put high demands on a city that has been stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little cal@@ ming down after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped working . &quot;
I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; several times from my roof .
I heard my voice resist@@ ing the silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we al@@ lied to a magnificent image filled with my expectations . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment you become aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he laid up .
then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can return your voice after you have scre@@ amed them all the way to the office of the Security Service .
I arrived there .
&quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men ; my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the colon@@ el Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; let me also hear how you scre@@ am &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am when we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes were shining upon me .
&quot; and you &apos;re really gri@@ eving , looking into my eyes and not on the ground ! &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was due to my fol@@ ly , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my thing when I replied : &quot; I would not have thought you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I &apos;ve never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such disa@@ strous consequences for me , and yet I do not regret a word of what I have said . &quot;
&quot; put it in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father immediately with it . &quot;
&quot; the same with his father . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cursed set is up to this day in the nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; syndrome , &quot; a psychological torture that I was subjected to months for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
&quot; in the first office , I leave everything I carry with me . &quot;
then back through the courtyard and into the second office which leads through a hall@@ way to the individual cells .
I &apos;ll take a look at all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise they have probably assigned me a larger cell this time .
&quot; I must share them with only one other prisoner , and I must immediately set myself without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes , which felt like a whole life , the official left the cell and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ established communication method : beating the fist against the wall . &quot;
I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; self @-@ sty@@ ling . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally replied .
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a resp@@ ectable middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness no prominent fac@@ tions can be seen in me , and there are no doctors here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ?
all the answers deny its existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will stop immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator assured me that they would release him , if I remain . &quot;
li@@ ars .
&quot; I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to remove all these crow@@ s , which are lab@@ elled by the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance I hear them scre@@ aming &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be around 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time , the cries , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black is the colour of per@@ dition until I saw the yellow light that presented the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; allu@@ ding to the 13th pro@@ stitute of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; thus , the secret was lifted : to protect the state security against us and to prevent the betra@@ yer and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - thus they played their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow vision of their world view . &quot;
here is no house that is not a land ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminals of their clan into a hero .
&quot; I enter the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slender and sto@@ cky man ; at least he is coming to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the expressions that suit him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I did not answer .
I &apos;ve got used to it not to answer .
I can &apos;t say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to deserve this punishment . &quot;
punishment in all their diversity .
his command is to pull me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube that probably origin@@ ates from the toilet .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold back your cries . &quot;
&quot; my cry was not enough for him , so they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself whether the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector , or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us , from their point of view , a great invention of a giant cable . &quot;
within one hour three of them altern@@ ated while I was still in the row .
&quot; I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I stopped scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling and didn &apos;t really enjoy it , so he attacked an electrically charged rod as the next . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed through my entire body , enough to supply my whole district . &quot;
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the de@@ af@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
&quot; I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say , that was my only option . &quot;
&quot; a few hours passed , which happened to me like minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; aus mit dir , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my father must worry terri@@ bly . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and move , you will be laid . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they had always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smo@@ kes a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ bal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b sp@@ ends most of his time in@@ doors ; at times he shu@@ ff@@ les to his screen , sometimes to his computer , and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is to discover a cigarette between his fingers or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives in the top@@ most floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and forced H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ lows ( for example : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist , confron@@ ting the conservative majority and questioning her old @-@ established views on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rape . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with themes such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also calls for the core of the whole Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by borders in his mind , and he can sympath@@ ize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries like Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not openly admit it , he has a special reluct@@ ance against U.S. foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his sympathy for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as a &quot; Palestinian refugee of the second generation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think of my own circumstances , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; &quot; I think so because I am a man , &quot; &quot; while he poured into water a Nes@@ café in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; apparently , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , having a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the chim@@ neys speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ ist@@ ers of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose mainly of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air , especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during the Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Interior Ministry has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the MP and former spokes@@ woman of the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; had been cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activ@@ ism , which issues the old @-@ proven legi@@ timacy of author@@ itarian regimes across the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be just shallow rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflected an increasingly evident reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b re@@ treated traditional gender standards by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre @-@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen .
&quot; it is surrounded by a red sea , perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the number of &apos; honour kill@@ ings &apos; has increased in Jordan - the in@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of hon@@ ors in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still ag@@ grav@@ ating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law on crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; be deta@@ ined for in@@ definite time in prison &quot; , &quot; and for their release many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music is also very popular and is well @-@ known for not shy away from issues that have long been t@@ abo@@ o in his country .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics has been in@@ filtr@@ ated me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b tackl@@ ed the question of the Palestinian identity . &quot;
in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; the focus again is on poverty .
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song titled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in this song , one verse often repe@@ ats itself : &quot;
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where you , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay men and les@@ bians and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals have been heavily cens@@ ored by 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , in order to see later that his comments were torn from context , twisted , and had been cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed but only a revised version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly advertising the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance against homosexu@@ als does not correspond to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ bia , a poet of the eighth century , still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b wonders : if Abu Nu@@ a , who would later work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ an@@ eer not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced .
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , Jord@@ anian Intelligence held several former government officials and members of the teacher &apos;s association , argu@@ ing that comment@@ aries in social media have been critical of the problems connected with the corruption deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , the H@@ da@@ i@@ bs concert is only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is how H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thought and inner changes . he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jord@@ anian society . &quot;
&quot; in the end , H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also to &quot; experience it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , street uni@@ tions and democr@@ atically minded democr@@ ats . at least , he hopes . &quot;
&quot; until then , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist . &quot;

Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant pupp@@ ets pupp@@ ets are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; it is assumed that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the fe@@ asts , the drums and dancing come over more than a thousand years and from a time in which armies from west Japan mar@@ ched to the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region , the E@@ mis@@ hi . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to catch a few great seats , which is why we have a great view . &quot;
one can hardly imagine how big these parts are ...
&quot; a communal centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro G@@ yo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking at the Meg@@ uro G@@ yo@@ en for a long time : two solid cars are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true one - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 @-@ metre @-@ high fixed car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange arms against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; outside appearance and body care were rare as in this story , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession as those of the hair@@ style . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to Lima &apos;s historic center - a region with a very high crime rate , where street rob@@ ber@@ y and illegal drug traffi@@ cking are com@@ mon@@ place . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , the appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Chile ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) has resulted in getting more and more normal citizens into the seas@@ oned hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers who can recre@@ ate these complex hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there , experts face each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as can be seen in the following video ( more videos on current cont@@ ests are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ az@@ ar Bon@@ dy , which is located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to persu@@ ade young people to exchange their weapons against hair tools and to get a training in hair@@ dresser art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work . &quot;
motivated by this activity and offering opportunities dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion .
&quot; before the school year starting in March , the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes : &quot;
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only school in the community and the district where we are very proud , because out of love with the children we have built up this educational community . &quot;
Colombia : letters of love to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters
photo : Valent@@ ina Mon@@ san@@ ve .
use with kind permission .
the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; Love Message to gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve .
the contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel pushed out to accommodate affection ? &quot;
the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ isti@@ an Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young @-@ Youth Foundation didn &apos;t get out of their head and inspired them to write letters to the young people to write letters to the young people .
&quot; only recently their country was the setting for a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had signed a peace treaty with the F@@ ARC gu@@ erri@@ lla movement ( German : revolutionary forces of Colombia ) , forming the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace agreement was considered so significant that the Colom@@ bian president Jose Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years , exposed to war rhet@@ oric and carrying their weapons around the clock must now re@@ integrate themselves into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society , which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters , must now take in its ranks and support it in building a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would have to close together and help in the integration process .
and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former gu@@ er@@ illa fighters to welcome them back to society .
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 Let@@ ters - one for every former gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter - to be handed over personally .
Valentine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the Let@@ ters to Rec@@ on@@ ci@@ liation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ isti@@ an had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , but forget those who need them much more . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed the most urgent response . &quot;
&quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; up to now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot;
I never thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipal administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ kind Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters . &quot;
the members of the F@@ ARC were set up as they used to do in order to receive the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they did not receive commands , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for all involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from anxiety to happiness , and everything in between , &quot; explained the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the Province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience as follows : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former soldier led me through the camp of the gu@@ er@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bri@@ ches &quot; ( a kind of hut where the gu@@ erri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a gu@@ erri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go in , because next to him on the bed lay a M@@ GL @-@ Gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; H@@ ello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; it was never in my life that someone wrote me such a beautiful thing , so I answered . &quot; &quot; suddenly tears came to me about the che@@ eks . &quot;
I hu@@ gged him completely and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
&quot; maybe he was too sorry for the war , I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life than war . to join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I only learned how to handle arms . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new Vo@@ ices
&quot; at the start of the event , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC joined a discussion . &quot;
&quot; the students were all grown up as already war , and the F@@ ARC was already in secret . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state affects the whole Colom@@ bian people . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worth overcoming all obstacles , &quot; &quot; said one of them . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; to listen to these people who had never heard , and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate them , are only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment , was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all people , including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former warri@@ ors responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , commander of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example , Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , the Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colum@@ bian people were prophes@@ ied that after the dis@@ ar@@ ming of peace there would reign .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people willing to resort to arms , raise and protest for their rights . &quot;
&quot; we from the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , to a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and sacrifice , as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; there will be many obstacles on our way , but together we will overcome them . &quot;
a Trans@@ ine talks about the persecution in Ch@@ echn@@ ya and the life before Kad@@ y@@ row

&quot; homosexu@@ als and qu@@ eer people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of hazards , including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , campaig@@ ners have witnessed the recent months reporting about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs like a dam@@ nation compla@@ ining about the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community has not been created overnight .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gro@@ z@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic at this time . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has conquered the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that discuss the dra@@ gging , torture and killing of qu@@ eer men in the Republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she cast a light on the methods of the Che@@ chen authorities suspected of qu@@ eer men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in arm@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ wife , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt she was actually a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equality of their fellow country@@ woman , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; out of fear for her life , she finally moved to the USA . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I worked as a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent them to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the lap . &quot;
&quot; on 10 October 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was about to fetch some shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; Here is a gift for you from your uncle . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt myself . &quot;
&quot; then I heard a phrase , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ yan : &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you stain ? &quot; &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital .
&quot; apparently , some women had received everything and started to scre@@ am . &quot;
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which wings were you placed , in which of the men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are out@@ dated , my male name is still on it , but the doctor understood and laid me on the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
&quot; when I first read his name at his office door , I got to do it with the fear ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good man .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in hospital .
&quot; last February , I received threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they demanded to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that all this was a lie . &quot;
&quot; they showed absurd demands : some told me I had to prove it by going up without the streets ; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Gro@@ z@@ ny and say that I hadn &apos;t changed my sex , that everything was only nau@@ ght speech , and Phot@@ os@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; They have brought a monster to the world , which has not only humili@@ ated your family but the entire Republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a religious woman , but you have to disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; it was too much for my mother , and she put a cord around her neck . &quot;
luckily the neighbors came and saved them .
&quot; at that time , I had to change the apartment several times a day . &quot;
&quot; I moved into an apartment and a few hours later , under the window , there was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95 . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something bad . &quot;
my human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you escape ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons , I don &apos;t want to reveal their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with their help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I still can &apos;t understand how it could be .
shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without regi@@ stering me , without identification , without knowing everything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe you &apos;re safe , just because you &apos;ve left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . they even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 .
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , that &apos;s a t@@ abo@@ o theme . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this psychological barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually make a lot of effort to look at the person they remember from their past - that is , my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know anything about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
what do your friends do ?
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report to Washington last week .
&quot; for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who was eating in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he told that during the Ram@@ adan people were not arrested and tortured , but also that all the Ram@@ adan &apos;s end could hardly wait , and he did not exclude a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now focus on family and relatives .
&quot; I mean , they probably invite the relatives , these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; honor &quot; &quot; experienced by blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are gay men still held in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there were just not many .
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to settle Kad@@ y@@ row &apos;s judgment . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are deta@@ ined there so that they can be presented later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people had not simply disappeared , they were deliberately sub@@ merged in order to become radi@@ cal@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is that just a guess , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote somebody who was imprisoned in Ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew .
there was nothing new from them ever since .
they just took them away .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , that person was himself when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports about this yet . we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already taken place in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in Gro@@ z@@ ny when I was still there - and I never had any problems .
in the serious !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , at that time it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to lead us originally to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is it possible under Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked , I had tin@@ ted eyel@@ ashes , wore tube jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never touched me just one hair .
&quot; before the Russian theater in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several benches were standing , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never insul@@ ted .
&quot; in the Ch@@ echn@@ yan language there is a saying : K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; Don &apos;t talk about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot;
it is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted , and never struck me . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : until Kad@@ y@@ row stepped on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began to talk about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he did not talk about us per se , but above all about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , one could feel how people started to change in the city . &quot;
those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before looked at you at once with suspicion .
in time I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya .
&quot; but every time I returned home , I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deterior@@ ated . &quot;
OC Media : what activity are you going to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the United States .
apart from that I am still active as a activ@@ ist .
I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize te@@ et@@ re@@ ffs , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t pay any cent for it for a long time .
I discovered these people myself when I rang out places of refuge .
I am a Muslim and wants to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ de@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s al@@ right .
&quot; nature , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Tsch@@ et@@ sch@@ enen , who want to make you know with foam in front of your mouth that there are no bo@@ bb@@ ins with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the Kab@@ ard@@ ines have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they are - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mos@@ que and fast in Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think about transition to men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that is a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different ways - two different kinds of sensation , to be precise , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not feel ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I &apos;m going to be so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago . &quot;
and I &apos;m not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now .
local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ z region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last months , there has been a strong increase in su@@ ici@@ des . &quot;
the photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named Y@@ asser Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the lim@@ eli@@ ght . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the southwest of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and wish to remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had ign@@ ited himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ ra@@ z . &quot;
according to local sources the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more .
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi minority in August , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Manifest@@ o , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hang@@ ed themselves . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : all the family fathers , who were hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government , were hel@@ pless and unable to pursue a safe work . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi suffers from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region in which a large part of the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ community living in Iran has been sh@@ attered by a profound economic crisis , which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living . &quot;
&quot; one century ago , the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy took power and invested great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran , as well as some of the most productive and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the native population only receives little from this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often a victim of untreated illnesses , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies jobs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government also built a large number of dam@@ s , which diver@@ t water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ hom are lying . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness , and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian General Director for Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ ra@@ z@@ is , who are looking for a job , finished primary school , finished 55 % of secondary school and have a university degree of 45 % . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ hi@@ i , an Iranian Ah@@ ra@@ zi human rights activ@@ ist based in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men . &quot;
&quot; the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans emerging from Ah@@ ra@@ z , and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process : &quot;
&quot; since officials and institutions do not prefer to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance among young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their home country . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affili@@ ation to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi , as even Arabic names at work are not tolerated , let alone the Spe@@ aking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi has to endure , human rights activ@@ ist attacks raise alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is un@@ treated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is prev@@ ent@@ able .

why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism
detail of a photo . taken by Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the website of A@@ fro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as . the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - react with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
&quot; they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments before me , why I should be feminist and why we should be all feminist * within . &quot;
&quot; for example , women still earn less money these days than men . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still cause women to come across a glass ceiling earlier or later in various spheres of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still through the many different countries and fai@@ ths . &quot;
all this is aware and known to me .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I come to speak on skin color , on racism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been mis@@ used in racial se@@ gregation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; lift up their voices and &quot; sing &quot; my Lord &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexu@@ alized violence there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist violence , which we expose black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other ethnic and country countries earn less than white men and women .
the fact that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems .
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men , and all men of any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands , who refuses to consider injusti@@ ces in her mind , which refers to both the sex and the skin color of a person . &quot;
I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affili@@ ation in a white @-@ feminist oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again .
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to uph@@ old an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical regard a dish@@ on@@ est and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups , who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural acquisitions in order to promote their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin colour and sex , as some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to teach them a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and differentiate themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to dissolve myself fully and completely from femin@@ ism , and to join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ismus , which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever before that we define black women to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us .
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ can@@ a wom@@ an@@ ly : recru@@ its ( about : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : how we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks about how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also be worshipped in this way , in which the cultural , spiritual , psychological , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists would immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about the hypo@@ cris@@ y and contradictions of the feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women of other cultures , as in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
&quot; because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman , I am recognized as a woman as part of this paradigm . &quot;
&quot; I , a black woman , can thri@@ ve in an environment where my life has neither passed over nor ignored nor rejected . &quot;

&quot; again and again Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years , mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special request from the Kurdist@@ an region of Iraq . his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
in this documentary of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church .
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summari@@ zes the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in one question : &quot; if we had no more water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work is on neglected , poorly attended sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of supp@@ ressed communities that can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays women and their difficult fight against violence

&quot; the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence Against Women in Paraguay &quot; &quot; of Kurz@@ eme . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ ght@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police com@@ miss@@ ar told A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her spouse , who had become violent towards her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put on the files , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman Bal@@ bu@@ ena showed up because of abuse , the informed A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez showed no advantage . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her ad . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women file a complaint at all , they generally do not receive support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they mi@@ stre@@ at . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report themselves at all to the law enforcement agencies . &quot;
&quot; inc@@ ens@@ 1 pun@@ ches and statistical 2 invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ments and a legal system , which is nothing inferior to three Paragu@@ ays legislation : good approach , inadequate realization pun@@ ches and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to see how many women are really ab@@ used , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot; &quot; there are various reports and reports that do not even show the extent of gender @-@ specific violence against women in Paraguay &quot; , &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; the numbers available , however , are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , 9@@ 600 ads participated in the District At@@ tor@@ ney General &apos;s Office for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the advertisements in the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace courts . 86 % of women were seen here as well .
&quot; in the ads , 40 % of women said that they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; these statistics , however , do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; for every woman ref@@ unded for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s suicide is not a criminal off@@ ence in Paraguay , the law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of women &apos;s suicide in the country . &quot;
the Co@@ ordin@@ ator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , every ten days in Paraguay dies a woman due to violence by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system that does not under@@ mine
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want to do that , but then she gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ ted for ever . &quot;
&quot; today , Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos . but for two years she endu@@ red the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most evident : &quot;
I never thought I would be a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that this only happens to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing her name , she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people answered their contributions , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they liked this so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it almost seemed as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who is not from Paraguay , fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner was ab@@ used . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I Beli@@ eve you &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in any way .
&quot; in the group they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others don &apos;t do : they take the women &apos;s statements seriously .
in Victori@@ as case everything started with psychological abuse .
her prosper@@ ous partner even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives , she received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an un@@ predictable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paragu@@ ay@@ ay laws : good approach , poor implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the announcement of mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice &quot; , &quot; Victoria San@@ tos says . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was deb@@ ated in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was announced under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # fear@@ ing ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ U@@ na@@ Men@@ os movement ( # No@@ AE ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law makes it possible to declare and punish Fem@@ izi@@ d as an independent criminal act as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; in this way , the legislative text has been modified in a number of ways in order to also gain members for the law that would be pav@@ ing the way for the de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the initial draft law had fores@@ een the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence must bear on their own , if they simply want to file a complaint and obtain a secure housing to impose the state . &quot;
Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it :
&quot; in Paraguay , abuse is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
a re@@ thinking must take place here so that violence can no longer be seen as something normal .
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the off@@ ence of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
we must cover such a long time until ill treatment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the Law was adopted at the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . before that , parts of the law had been altered , including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions about the changes are taking apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the submission of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political violence &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; out of parts of the law is regarded as a major set@@ back . &quot;

independent media exposed to attacks one year after a newspaper ban
&quot; this website was closed on the website of the forbidden newspaper Az@@ am@@ n on the basis of a decision by the Minister of Information .
&quot; more than a year ago , the Peru@@ vian authorities closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n for its coverage of corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he served as a one @-@ year custo@@ dial sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , were arrested and tried , but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been governed since 1970 by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid , who came to power after he had abol@@ ished his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at . &quot;
&quot; since then , in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he is the main office in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sul@@ t@@ ans rule is marked by the per@@ sever@@ ing efforts of security forces , particularly domestic intelligence , civil liber@@ ties , including freedom of press , restric@@ ting and deta@@ ining human rights def@@ enders , independent journalists , blo@@ ggers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically limit peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to express their views on the public affairs of the country , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
&quot; Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper , in which corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) has been reported since its inc@@ eption in 2007 until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article entitled &quot; tie @-@ up parties tie up hands of justice &quot; on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put pressure on judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a court ruling . &quot;
&quot; issue of the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n dated July 26 , 2016 with a report on the title page with the heading : &quot; high @-@ level parties tie the hands of justice . &quot; &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Za@@ her Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i , member of the Board of Editorial , was charged by ISS to the Special Department and arrested on his arrival by security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , he held the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who had acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the paper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper was prohibited on any road , including online , from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ kat . &quot;
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison sentences and also ordered the final closing of the paper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both condemned , among other things , for distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the Pres@@ ent of the State . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of violation of a ban on publication and slan@@ der .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years of imprisonment and fin@@ es amoun@@ ting to 3,000 om@@ anic rib@@ bons ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) , and a one @-@ year ban on the occupation of the two journalists was imposed . &quot;
al @-@ A@@ br@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network to spread material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; a security deposit was set for Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i in the amount of $ 5,000 om@@ anic ( $ 13@@ ,000 ) and was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ A@@ br@@ i on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari sentenced to six months in prison . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six @-@ month prison sentence from the Central P@@ rison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison , where he served his one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
the Appe@@ als Court also rev@@ oked the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to happen again , the newspaper continues to be exposed to attacks by the government . &quot;
&quot; on January 8 , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended for three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the Minister made a further objection to the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ publish the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; the ongoing shut@@ down of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which , in recent times , press freedom was viol@@ ated in Oman . &quot;
&quot; further injuries include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closing of Az@@ am@@ n and the arrest of journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the Afgh@@ an authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of freedom of the press . &quot;
the Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Korean authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n so that their journalists can pursue their work ;
3. to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman can exercise their legitimate human rights work un@@ hin@@ dered and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including court ch@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Gulf Center for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ ggers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association , and the right to assemble , support and protect themselves peac@@ efully . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , picture taken with consent &quot;
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area , which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
there are two reasons why there are two reasons for the need for locally performed medical research : firstly there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and malaria have far more severe consequences in Africa &apos;s poor@@ est countries than elsewhere , and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , carried out by African scientists , helps build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; he grew up in the 1990s in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic had first serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , initially in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post @-@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he resear@@ ched the HIV virus himself before deciding to go back home to support the sam@@ ba health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings in the media about this research . &quot;
( disc@@ la@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ba national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests .
&quot; in addition , I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant pathogens . &quot;
GM : what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there are no basic research here . we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being a mo@@ ver yourself . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GV : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported differently .
it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because financing and development chances are better in other countries .
GV : how is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research that you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
laboratory equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries .
GV : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
RW : there is already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods .
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GV : how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , exploration of space , health care ( non @-@ communic@@ able and con@@ ta@@ gious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this . &quot;
GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience ?
&quot; RW : often , it is the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines can only make articles available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; Open Source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; this entry by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide . &quot;
Frank Mor@@ ton has been breeding Sal@@ ad in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; his company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ sh@@ uc@@ ination , the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mor@@ ton &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many sorts of let@@ tu@@ ce it can get . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of the 2000 , he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding . &quot;
&quot; patents were applied not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the last few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or car@@ rot varieties . due to this trend plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mor@@ ton is still cultiv@@ ating let@@ tu@@ ce , but it takes longer for it because its work is more and more difficult due to increasing restrictions . &quot;
it &apos;s as if there &apos;s a b@@ oul@@ der lying in a river in order to p@@ addle me .
&quot; so we have to do that right now , but it is a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think that these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new kind of salad because all the characteristics are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very careful and stri@@ ves to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
&quot; he has also joined a movement that is growing steadily in the United States and all over the world : open source breeding ( &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have cultivated and ate red Roman salad of the Out@@ sh@@ uc@@ ination variety in the &quot; glas@@ sh@@ ouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( Initiative for Open Source seeds ) is inspired by the free &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ ri@@ ghted software . &quot;
it was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , called O@@ ss@@ i , US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they have cultivated . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they will not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open @-@ Source &quot; breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties and not immediately cut it out - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant pat@@ ties . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014 .
glo@@ omy prospects
&quot; for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and O@@ ss@@ i board member , Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seeds , seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphas@@ ises that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement does not concern genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control of the seed industry , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seed is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to making other seeds available free of charge , in contrast to patent seeds and plant traits . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; O@@ ss@@ i supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material , which is therefore always limited . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of O@@ ss@@ i , has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; such estimates are not yet available for other plants , but experts such as Lu@@ by suspect that massive cultivated plants such as wheat are pat@@ ter@@ ned in even greater style than salad or car@@ rots . &quot;
a Mat@@ ter of Visi@@ bility
&quot; plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit specifically desired traits - from those by which their taste or colour is improved to such , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders takes over more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before , since the changing conditions caused by climate change are much less predictable . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ spokesperson C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknowled@@ ges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture , the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the notion that intellectual property supports other breeders because &quot; patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ ton sees the other : 20 years to wait , until a patent exp@@ el , certainly does not promote innovation . &quot;
&quot; if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changing environmental conditions , you would have already lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; but the main argument for Mor@@ ton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; that is what drives us , and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; altogether , Mor@@ ton interfer@@ es with the concept of pat@@ enting plant traits : &quot; we do not really create the traits themselves . &quot;
&quot; the plants form them ourselves , and as a bree@@ der we have no idea how the plants do that . &quot;
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; there is another important aspect of plant breeding for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oreg@@ on and O@@ ss@@ i . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation produce her@@ bi@@ cides , bred in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is just opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such as Mon@@ san@@ to ) have patents , most smaller seed companies manage to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;

&quot; Mor@@ ton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding crop patents : &quot; &quot; it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent , you are protected from competition for 20 years with a patent that makes it very easy for me to think . &quot; worldwide response &quot;
&quot; while the US seems to be a leader in the &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture introduces itself as a professional organization in the field of resource , an open source seed programme . to preserve the seed of traditional crops , the Centre co@@ operates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also helps them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organization Agre@@ co@@ l works on an open @-@ source license , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of O@@ ss@@ i commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( regulations for breeding differ from country to country , therefore the O@@ ss@@ i obligation cannot simply be adopted one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be patented . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os hosted a conference on &quot; &quot; Open Source &quot; &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organization currently builds a global alliance for &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed systems for which the official start @-@ up should fall for planned next year . &quot;
&quot; a consortium of environmental protection and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit development aid organization US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , published a report from aid organizations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report highlights the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Lu@@ by von O@@ ss@@ i hopes that more people will soon see it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly paid attention to where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is still more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organization and blog are the latest aims of cens@@ orship in Egypt
&quot; still , the Egyptian authorities continue to block content on the internet . &quot;
this time it met the website of a human rights organization and the blog of a colum@@ ni@@ sts .
&quot; on the weekend of 5 August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ HR@@ I ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reports over the above . &quot;
the network published a statement on Facebook in August in which it sharply critici@@ zed the Egyptian authorities for this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region .
&quot; despite this attack and ridi@@ cu@@ le of Egyptian law and constitution by the authorities who are actually defending the law , it has never been as important as now . AN@@ HR@@ I confirms that all technical possibilities are exhausted to overcome these goals and not give up . we insist on fulfilling our task further . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ HR@@ I is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking issue of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Qatar @-@ based Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network for alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; # Egypt : 1 . human rights organization of the wave of wave lock@@ outs , @ An@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ M@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K &quot;
&quot; in addition to AN@@ HR@@ I , there is no more access to Egypt on the blog of colum@@ ni@@ sts and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt &apos;s non @-@ accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog he directed to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider who is also home to Zi@@ adas &apos;s blog , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in jail after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 while reporting about the student protests and taking a video on how the police exercised physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve mainly on politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the block@@ ade by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; to block blo@@ gs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ f@@ atta@@ h al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of blo@@ gs may not be meaningful for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; 1 ) I managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege , a arrest , attempted assass@@ ination , un@@ loading at the National Security Council , blocking blo@@ gs as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
2 ) You have proven that I did not write for nothing . in other words : my words have influence if only on a small audience .
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to avoid cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave walk the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Expression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August . this resulted in technical tests on networks of different Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in addition , af@@ te documented the blocking of providers by transferring internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in their research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
such practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue blocking and filtering the content that Egyptian users might have access to .
&quot; in addition , the situation is worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , by which the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed to court against these acts . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ or and whom will it attack next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in the war ?
the inhabitants argue .
&quot; the Brazilian Army deployed in the fav@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ ó@@ i , a city in the state of Rio de Janeiro , during the governmental crisis . &quot;

&quot; day after day newspapers report in Brazil with dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; thi@@ eves rob@@ bed chem@@ ist with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air @-@ Atlantic to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the 2017 violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become com@@ mon@@ place and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; in this way , the &quot; Extra &quot; newspaper , known for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16 August , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which she announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city will now be published there .
the paper explains the motives for their decision :
&quot; it will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , however , devi@@ ated from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens in Rio will be published in the column &quot; &quot; war in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of crying : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four @-@ minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper writes on : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , if distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police that first shoots and then asks questions . &quot;
but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners .
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , the journalist C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira , on the other hand , ar@@ gues against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and smu@@ g neglect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong , according to C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country according to the statistics of 2015 . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data . &quot;
none of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the mur@@ ders per state , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; according to the company Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as C@@ ec@@ í@@ lia emphasizes , has been repe@@ ating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , was one of these security policy measures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decline of violent deaths . but after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under fire after several reports on ch@@ ic@@ ans and repression against the poor congregations , which should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux selected one of his articles from 2010 , explaining why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal questions , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and means that are typical of war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which a civilian is an obsc@@ ure point in the landscape and becomes an object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
&quot; a week ago , the police performed the mountain with the fav@@ ela Jac@@ ar@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal sieg@@ es and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories World@@ watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syri@@ ans in a state of siege both in Damascus and the surrounding country , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the region of Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21 , 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpet@@ rated on the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebel @-@ controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus , leading to the fact that inhabitants are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; through the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ reachable for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter@@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian hel@@ pers and academ@@ ics teaches the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own fung@@ i as a &quot; life saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; fung@@ i do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria , and are only very rare in the Syrian cuisine . however , their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besi@@ eg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the right of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said vis @-@ à @-@ vis the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and bas@@ ements . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , that for three years already fought to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more . &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the plant@@ ation of mushrooms , says Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around € 12,@@ 700 , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , the 4th of September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; due to the fuel shortage , locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la told Global Vo@@ ices that they began &quot; &quot; production of fung@@ al seeds originating from the regions &quot; &quot; before checking out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have created a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months , they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in Eastern Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a greater movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; : a break in the siege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food resi@@ dues ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) to produce new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their home .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; we hope to spread this idea throughout the world , so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible . &quot;
we want our experience to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of the 2017 fires
several hundred people prot@@ ested on 21 October in many regional capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal in the week before .
&quot; forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October , which resulted in the last week of solidarity with the victims of solidarity with the victims for 3 days . &quot;
&quot; fires were also recorded in Gali@@ cia in Spain , where there were 4 dead . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 break@@ outs , which spread to the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy oc@@ cured in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system monitoring the forest areas by satellite photos alone in 2017 in Portugal , about 500@@ ,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire only in 4 districts .
&quot; Portugal burns literally in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a , ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;

numerous videos spread in the net and show pictures which allow better insights into what is happening :
the predictable tragedy
the aim of the Saturday &apos;s protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why the Civil Defence was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ el of the government of farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , streets and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were enclosed by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria a similar tragedy would have happened in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building appro@@ vals in locations with high risk of fire are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was rejected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a sl@@ ack@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity to fall if the applicant had means of self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; continues Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val in the same article in the newspaper P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus trees , trees of easily combus@@ tible wood , like in a vi@@ cious circle , continued to spread after fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; in addition to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th , when inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives , was offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the people with information : they took advantage of their own civil protection data using fo@@ ve@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ gade and , on this fat@@ eful weekend in October , was so decisive that the servers did not withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , the leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ oo , dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been killed by the Taliban , and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred of the Haz@@ ara , came ever closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af was found again in Pakistan . &quot;
for a couple of years he worked in a coal mine .
&quot; then he took what was left of his low wages , and went to Iran . once more , he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and tow@@ ed sacks with mort@@ ars that were heavier than himself to make a living . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , the life of Afgh@@ an refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af recalls in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afgh@@ an refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked . &quot;
there were no services and no heating . we hung nylon in front of the open windows to avoid freezing at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; when crossing the sea , he suffered ship@@ wre@@ ck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time , A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , running through the streets of Rome , sleeping in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid patients twice a day . &quot;
it is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers as a result of relatively high twin quot@@ as . it is also true that the conditions which find asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic .
the Human Rights Organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommod@@ ated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; &quot; which are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ qualified personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum , which after regi@@ stering the asylum application can still go for months . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who do not have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his irre@@ pres@@ sible life @-@ willingness helped A@@ shar@@ af to soon release himself out of these conditions .
&quot; after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af put his total savings into the establishment of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast bar .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ber &apos;s success story is now the theme of the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venice luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; in 2017 , the film received the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; a lot of bureaucracy , high taxes and terms for loans are just some of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to the official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , a number of Afgh@@ an companies have emerged , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afgh@@ an restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience where the wa@@ iters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of her trip to Italy through the various Afgh@@ an , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot;
the Afgh@@ an entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome also are Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ i &apos;s goals go far beyond the Italian restaurant industry and retail , and aim back to the country that he had forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I can &apos;t live happily if I know my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also al@@ ig@@ ns plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and conservation techniques . &quot; they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses on the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but in the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself , and now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey . &quot;
&quot; citizen report : bill dra@@ fts from Egypt permit the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for over 900 days . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the clearing of Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya camp in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the de@@ composition of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ate &apos;s Ne@@ tizen report is an international snapshot , showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian Parliament scrut@@ ini@@ zes a draft law which fores@@ ees that users can only use social media such as Twitter or Facebook after regi@@ stering with a government authority .
&quot; in order to be able to use the social networks , users must register within six months of the submission of the law on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name as well as their ID number . &quot;
those who miss this step could be sentenced to a prison term of up to six months or the den@@ si@@ fication of a penalty .
&quot; the law , promoted by sixty members of Parliament , is currently ahead of the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and is to be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another member of Parliament submitted a legislative proposal , in which more severe pen@@ alties for the insul@@ t of the president or a high official would be introduced . &quot;
&quot; under the legislative proposal , however , such an act would be punished with jail and fin@@ es , so legal experts at the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; should the law be adopted , this can mean up to three years in prison for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ pin a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he photographed Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators , who had led Mohammed Mor@@ si to take office . &quot;
&quot; as more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan was waiting for four years in prison for a trial . &quot;
&quot; recently his trial was postpon@@ ed to 20 May , because the prison administration failed to bring the defend@@ ants from prison to the cour@@ t@@ room . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatened with death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , including pseu@@ do @-@ property , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal tribunal in G@@ iz@@ a was acqu@@ itting two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were accused of reporting on pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the Court also reduced the pen@@ alties of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the previous incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
interro@@ g@@ ating Tunisi@@ an activists to documents watched by Tunisi@@ an activists
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was chi@@ ef@@ ly interro@@ gated by the president of the Republic who , according to the plan , explicitly backed a controversial draft law that would guarantee business people and the former ré@@ gi@@ me by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption , provided they return all the illeg@@ ally received funds . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 , on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the legislation look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia le@@ aned the nam@@ ing of his sources under Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which re@@ ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the 9th of May , he was a witness in the Tunis District Court . &quot;
does China want to force users of social media to submit their ID ?
&quot; according to new provisions of the Information Off@@ ices of the State Council of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share messages in social media . &quot;
the regulations also indicate that registration with full real name will be required .
analysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments is to be reached within social networks . it is up to now unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
do we then see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ am@@ nad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the state government as the &quot; organis@@ er of the distribution of information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law dating back to 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the publication of the information . &quot;
&quot; websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ clas@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , e @-@ mail service mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court has access to Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court had the source Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the information that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , Maritime Affairs and Communication said that the site was closed because it became &quot; a source of information that co@@ operates with groups in order to combat Turkey &apos;s political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey completely blocks the website . it is , among other things China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can &apos;t stop s@@ no@@ oping around
&quot; after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with increased supervisory powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ code data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be passed on to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
