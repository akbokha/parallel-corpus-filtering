<seg id="1">Although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 I would live there for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is exceedingly great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, had been dancing to American music, read American writers and practised his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly due to an American film journalist."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the great Denzel Washington as he played the Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who wanted to fill the murderous conspiracy of an oil-magnet with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the highest federal court with judges who were interested in his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was trapped.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to Method Man," I was as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the USA had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be who you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very blackish love letter about his greatness.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much was written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"with his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain, as one says so beautifully."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks, as a former colleague put it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, the people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican primaries was the highest number, a candidate nominated by the party ever."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I could not reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met during my time in Phoenix.</seg>
<seg id="22">"for example, my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, which receives people from all over the world, a deeply believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trump's view of the world did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current publisher of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"there is also a contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still adapts to the commitment of Kristi Kappes, who always helped me with a lot of patience and grace and helped my colleagues to get used to the complexity of American life."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew Leakey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values represented by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump made his way to nominate Republican presidential candidates, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, it turned out that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly white, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the pump electors as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to classify people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and suggests an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities will not be taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, did they perhaps want to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Maybe. maybe.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments on the cruel decision to lift a man who looks down on those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(M. B. Ü): as much as" banning the whites against all other ethnic groups "; puzzling white in allusions to the whites and whiplash, as the big Van Jones called, has just killed what America has made so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background you may have, America is welcome everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyaner, whose history, as he says himself, nowhere else could be possible anywhere in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the choice of Donald Trump, there is a huge part of the White Americas on this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is again at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, Captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "asked Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "no!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"no!" the crowd roared.</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"" "no!" "they answered."</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried, and their voices became louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"would anyone, who is not like you, have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, this is not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is now Trump Land, the message said."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find any place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And this breaks my heart.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Omar Mohammed is currently part of the ICFs Knight International Journalism Fellowship and a leader of the Code for Africa in Tanzania, a continent wide civil technical and data journalism initiative."</seg>

<seg id="69">What is the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateurah together?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the fact that the music played at both places has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular with tourists - but worlds away from the nearby preColumbian ruins and its world-famous kitchen."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now La banda de Música (music bande) has been playing in the congregation: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for Vicente Guerrero's community in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The English newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, which is located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and the gangs of gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a chance meeting with a French pilot who started a musical project and gave the youth a rare ray of hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they get out of school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and with glittering eyes and play in the hustle you learn to play trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, forest horn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from waste</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7.000 km south of Vicente Guerrero, the children of Cateura are playing a village located on the top of the largest landfill site of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with remanufactured instruments, which consist of local solid waste materials, produced in a workshop dedicated to musical instruments in Cateuras, where the recyclers have begun to turn parts of waste into instruments under the direction of Favio Chávez."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, contrabasses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all made of trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music from the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and musical teacher of the children of Cateurah, remembers at the beginning:"</seg>
<seg id="87">First it was very difficult because we had no place to rehearse and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in the trash. the children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children.</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio had shown something he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra that plays on instruments from reprocessed material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (harmonic waste dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of waste each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and him are the poorest - like the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn it into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill harmonics follows the orchestra with its inspirational play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully fight illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that focuses on international, practiced solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release takes place within the framework of an agreement with Global Voices to share content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already pursued illegal fishing in Liberia's waters before picking up the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal of this species on its coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comores, Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobilizing themselves against the ship. they refused to buy one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries that simply refused to do anything," "remembers Benedict Kiilu, a senior employee of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at that time."</seg>
<seg id="104">"in 2013, the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: he was unable to catch fish there."</seg>
<seg id="105">"in the end, it was forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia, due to the plundering of fish stocks in the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which intersects criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"alongside Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries that had driven the prime minister from their waters at that time."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "we have eight countries that are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand up to each other where it comes to illegal fishing," "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trust project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to detect it. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by the deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while actions against illegal fishing were once obstructed by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail stamp, with the information circulating between individual countries, the actions nowadays happen in real time, with trackable on FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, such as suspicious activities or details that one notices or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">"fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move on the open sea, using satellite data."</seg>
<seg id="114">This makes it possible for the authorities to identify vessels fishing in prohibited areas - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships.</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations can show whether the participating ships have a fishing license where they were on the road and possibly whether they have a penal code."</seg>
<seg id="116">"on the basis of this information, countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such ships in their ports. what does that mean that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about substantial financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," says Per Erik Bergh, director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm which supports the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i. "</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the aforementioned platform has been created to regain an estimated 20 million USD in lost revenues, which the eight members of HISH-i network lose every year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region is attracting commercial fishing from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include, among other things, actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, information of fanciful names, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" they purposefully use the lack of international cooperation and exploit the weaknesses of a completely organized control system, "" says Long. "" in the past, a ship could fish illegally and a country could say "You may not run my port." "</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and precisely this legal loophole is trying to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">"up to now, the closed front functions."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 tests of suspected vessels."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has pursued and found fleeting ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"with INTERPOL, the international agency for the fight against crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information on illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to accurately locate suspicious ships.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" "illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position," "says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and offers technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">"therefore, Copeland helps build a system that connects different levels of information. FISH-i is designed to help identify non-discriminating ships with greater precision."</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes this."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana marine conservation organization: a platform that provides satellite data and displays the position of each tracking ship worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "get together with neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing - it simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and combine their resources to study."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this at a global level." "Pew Charitable Trust has a similar project to run where a global system allows the prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">"ships, which used to be fished without a license earlier and hardly had consequences, now know that they are observed."</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating in FISH-i have meanwhile recorded a 33% increase in fisheries turnover since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i had helped to track down Greko 1, the inspectors found there towing nets where they were forbidden."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we are a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"six countries have joined forces in 2015, the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are now fighting illegal fishing, according to the exact same model as FISH-i." "with certainty the goal is to create even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently FISH-i's most recent member state Somalia announced its first major triumph: in October it introduced Greko 1, a ship under false flag."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also invaded in forbidden waters that were reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "with the taking of measures against Greko 1, they put a strong signal that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative working method to protect the oceans really works across the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London."</seg>
<seg id="152">"her articles are published in Wired Magazine, TED Education, New York Times and The Guardian."</seg>
<seg id="153">The street movements in Venezuela only seem to be the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are said to be protesting against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the inauguration of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="157">"after the Venezuelan government rejected the opposition's request for a referendum on a referendum, Venezuelans reacted in whose eyes the negotiations on the country's political and economic crisis ran into emptiness by gathering themselves on the streets."</seg>
<seg id="158">"under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuelan (example: the reincarnation of Venezuela), pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found."</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate will also be conducted in other parts of the country, including the Barinas flat land area, in the Andean regions of Mérida and Táchira, in the central-north district of Carabobo and at Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta."</seg>
<seg id="160">"the political and economic situation of the country is steadily deteriorating, which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezuelans through an acute lack of food and medicines."</seg>
<seg id="161">"many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for fundamental change during the inauguration of the current President Nicolás Maduro, but in the end, the secrecy of a re-election was blocked by the official authorities."</seg>
<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, contributors to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"within the framework of the social, political and economic crisis, in which inflation and profits are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% for the annual financial statements) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum was considered the only way to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>
<seg id="164">"in addition, a 12-hour strike on the following day as well as a march to the Miraflores palace, the Venezuelan government, planned to continue on November 3, should continue the blocking of the referendum on the National Assembly."</seg>
<seg id="165">"the appeal was commented on Twitter, among others, as follows:"</seg>

<seg id="199">"when he was 15 years old, Luis Alberto Quijano was forced by his father to take a look at the atrocities committed in La Perla, a secret prison in the Argentinean city of Córdoba."</seg>
<seg id="200">"as a mature man, Quijano now testified to his father as part of the large La Perla Ribera trial in the province of Cordoba."</seg>
<seg id="201">"the trial, which ended on 24 August 2016, was investigated for crimes committed during the Argentinian military dictatorship."</seg>
<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"starting with the burden of wearing the same name as his father, to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">He kept the family secret for 34 years.</seg>
<seg id="205">In the situation at that time I thought that this was alright.</seg>
<seg id="206">I felt like a secret.</seg>
<seg id="207">"as a child with 15 years of age, one does not notice that one is manipulated by his father."</seg>
<seg id="208">"at that time I could not realize that my father was a thief, torturer and murderer."</seg>
<seg id="209">"Luis had no choice: his father Luis Alberto Quijano was Gendarmerieofficials. during the Argentinean military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983, a time of state terrorism, his father was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department at La Perla prison from 1976 to 1978."</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be fine.</seg>
<seg id="226">"on the military base, I had to destroy papers belonging to the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="227">"all possible documents were: university degrees, handwritten notes, literature, certificates, propaganda material, books, simply everything."</seg>

<seg id="229">"over there the prisoners are tortured,"</seg>
<seg id="230">My father took me four times to La Perla with - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">During the first and the last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to get off. he led me to a barracks, in the cars, furniture, TV, fridges - everything possible."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small package wrapped in a blanket and commanded me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lump of silver in it."</seg>
<seg id="235">"on that day, I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were shut off and kept me with a guard."</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Over there the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I looked inside, and saw a lying on which people were tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">It looked like a field bed and metal springs.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later on I found out that they attached it to the end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person lying there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they seldom caught a man with handcuffs on the bed, poured it out with water and drove him a charge of 220 volts in the genitals."</seg>

<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... like a dirty diaper.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was placed under house arrest, the same smell came from his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I realized the smell immediately and I realized that the smell of a body is in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I could never forget this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible for someone to hurt another person?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew these people were killed</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were tied with handcuffs and wearing eyebrows."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke with" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also tried in the trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">"in the background, I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people were lying down with the face down - all were tied at hands and feet."</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people crouched silently on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "Why do you look so, asshole?"</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why did you kill me?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told me at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, some rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero gathered and killed a man there.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to survivors, the civil servant Jorge Romero, who was also tried in the La Perla-Ribera trial, reviewed the students Raúl Mateo Molina."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video, Emilio Fessia, head of the La Perla Memorial, leads through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came in here is also the way on which the kidnapped came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"when you look at the map, you see that they took about this path and then tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">"here their names were changed, and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization."</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra until the order from above came that they should be relocated."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all possible stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">At that time at the age I had no idea what the "booty" - as they called it - was.</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was in the military later, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war booty is a bayonet or perhaps military signs that you have fought against."</seg>

<seg id="274">This is theft.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the head of the security forces, could participate in this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I simply don't understand it.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was an officer at the gendarmerie and I would never have liked to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my father could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal and I replied," "And you, who steals cars on the road?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded with anger, struck me and cried:"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, then I will find you and will kill you."</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need anyone else to do that!</seg>
<seg id="284">My father was like this.</seg>
<seg id="285">I don't have a single good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"as I said in the process, I showed a photo from then, on which I wore a jacket and a roll-knit jumper made of wool. both had my dad from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought home clothes."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time, the defence accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can load me to what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">I was there anyway to testify.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of the corpse is the last abominable act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now, where I am older, I feel remorse."</seg>
<seg id="292">I have children. once you have children you can see the value of a life.</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is false to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you executed people during dictatorship, but why the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why kidnap children?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day my father brought a girl home, whose mother was killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pets, almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I repeatedly asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess, it was simply decided to kill these people. but why did their bodies disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also have families to whom one could pass their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of the corpse is the last abominable act you can do to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they fetched machines to remove the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where." you'll never find something, "said my father."</seg>
<seg id="306">But of course something always remains.</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed human beings!</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to clarify: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even in the gendarmerie even myself.</seg>
<seg id="310">"I just said the truth about 20 criminals, including my father."</seg>
<seg id="311">"the idea to show my father was born during a conversation, when he was under house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="312">I reproached him for all the atrocities I had to experience for him.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," "I don't know. I didn't kill anyone."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly repelled and asked myself why all the exaggerated patriotism and the" Western and Christian feelings, "which they supposedly defended, were actually good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I yelled:</seg>

<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed human beings!</seg>

<seg id="344">The sign with translation error at a center in Kyoto where you can extend your driver's license.</seg>
<seg id="345">The photo was spread in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="346">Editing of the original Joshua Levine photos.</seg>
<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can extend its driving license, last month witnessed a very misguided translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"in a sign, the Japanese word" "Rolled" "(" "older drivers" "), which means" "older drivers", "falsely - perhaps also with malicious hind thoughts & # 8212, was translated as" "awful motorists". ""</seg>
<seg id="349">The wrong translation was to be read on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself from 1 to 20 September.</seg>
<seg id="350">Edited by Joshua Levine's original photo in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="351">"the error was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also aware of the local newspapers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-based daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"how could such an English translation come?</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city, as Kyoto is simply unacceptable," Holmes said. "</seg>
<seg id="356">"the faulty English translation was initially removed. the term" "dangerous drivers" "was replaced later by the appropriate, if not quite correct term" "elder drivers" "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the Kyoto Prefecture has apologized for translation errors. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they had received by the translator and that the translation was not checked for accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are truly sorry that older people felt offended by the inadequate correction (translation)," "said the police."</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online news service J-Cast News addressed a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the "terrible" older drivers in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" awful "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older drivers. according to the police, the percentage of older drivers who are involved in accidents across the country, however, is quite a cause of concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto Prefecture, for example, 1,941 were caused by a total of 19,460 cases of seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a share of 10%."</seg>
<seg id="363">"ten years later, in 2014, seniors 1,803 caused a total of 11,850 crashes."</seg>
<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of accidents caused by seniors has risen during the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">"in the version of the article published on Yahoo, the named unnamed reporter revealed comments to the light which show which prejudices some Japanese apparently hold against older drivers:"</seg>
<seg id="367">"the article on the translation error, among other things, received the following comments:"</seg>
<seg id="368">"-" "Is this (" "awful motorists" ") about not reality?"</seg>
<seg id="369">"" "so faulty the translation is not at all, right?" ""</seg>

<seg id="376">There are many reasons for the wide spread of translation errors.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills to understand the source text and active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators in the target language - not in the target language - should be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French into English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ staff with English as a native language to translate the translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translation, cost reasons or the relatively small number of English native speakers that learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who have no foreign co-workers, can still make translations in-house. then, the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is valued as the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translation is also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and enigmatic movements, which are produced by machine translation, show that this technique can't replace any human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic prints that often decorate shirts or pockets, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least innocuous as jewelry, but from large corporations or government that have the means to ensure higher standards, one can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">In the future Kyoto uses a more serious source of translations.</seg>

<seg id="393">"later, other users wrote that VPITV and El Capitolio TV websites were no longer accessible."</seg>
<seg id="394">Other online transmitters also recorded footage of the protests in Caracas organized by opposition groups opposing the government of Nicolás Maduros.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the protests started at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and transferred the Parliament's duties to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>

<seg id="400">"services such as Vivoplay are popular with the Venezuelans with Internet access, especially in times of turbulence."</seg>
<seg id="401">"traditional media have been reluctant to report protests since 2014. at that time, the Commission for Telecommunications threatened them with fines and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw this as a" call for violence. ""</seg>

<seg id="405">"previous research by the Institute for Press and Society (IPYS), a research group for digital rights in Venezuela, had revealed that the local Internet providers sometimes use DNS."</seg>
<seg id="406">"if a website is blocked by the DNS, the server answers wrong or refuses the request when calling such a website."</seg>

<seg id="418">"Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family, who lived there."</seg>
<seg id="419">"shortly before her graduation at the university, she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was proudly talking about her." she is like a daughter for us. "</seg>
<seg id="420">"she, out of which something has become," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she began to work as crimpadita for the family. in Paraguay there are more than 46,000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a large family with little money transfers their underage son or her minor daughter to another more rich family. in exchange, the child gets food, an education and a roof over his head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"what is not mentioned, however, is that the children must pay for innumerable days of homework that will never be paid and victims of abuse and mistreatment can - and all this within the framework of a contract you cannot lift."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, called Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay as a result of the participation and acceptance by large sections of society and, in spite of numerous complaints by human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after graduating, Alvarenga worked for a couple of years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she talked to Criadilla - especially young girls - affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researched and denounced."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things by name, for the feeling of gratitude that crimped the crimp is generally silent."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on a double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, there is the family, their daughter in the belief that they complete their training, improve their position in society and" "make something out of themselves" "to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family who receives the girl and justifies her exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no education and maybe even starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">Victims of the Criadazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is mistreated, his family will be experienced many years later."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never even hear about it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the relatively unknown phenomenon, which occurs in secret in paraguayan households, was given a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed signs of violent beating. shortly afterwards she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was in the home of the former military personnel Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín was living with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometres east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira hit Marín as long as she suffered fatal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">A few days later the media reported on the incident.</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organisations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the practice of Criadazgo responsible for the death of the girl deeply rooted in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Criadazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there could be "no more Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in the social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," says Tina Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="449">"without documents, it is much easier to violate the rights of children."</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The Ehepaars' neighbours and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for a prompt investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">"they want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison for the murder of the girl, who was her Criadita."</seg>
<seg id="453">"when the case comes to justice, the case of Carolina Marín could be a trend-breaking event - if for the first time in the Paraguayan history a case of Criadazgo comes to court."</seg>

<seg id="455">"the Crimean tas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age."</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when Farbik, in which her father worked, had to register bankruptcy and her father lost his job."</seg>
<seg id="457">"their brothers had to work now and began selling sweets on the street or on the market, in order to earn money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent to the capital Asunción in Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of her employer, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours every day."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to share the time so that she had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose early every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, it cleansed the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and infected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she was done with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because she had to make dinner for her employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food." I was allowed to bring more books from the library of the landlord than eating out of the fridge, "she recalls."</seg>
<seg id="468">"the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord, a former military and sympathiser of the Partido Liberal, a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Alfredo Stroessner, who was in power from 1954 until 1989."</seg>
<seg id="469">"in some evenings, the landlord Alvarenga forced him to stand next to him and to read editorial papers like" Sendero "or" El Pueblo. ""</seg>
<seg id="470">He tried to persuade them not to believe the official media reports of the dictator's regime.</seg>
<seg id="471">"" "the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="472">"they did not often allow me to visit my family, because they believed that I would" "learn bad habits" "again."</seg>

<seg id="500">Image of Pixabay changed by Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian parliamentarians recently voted in favour of a bill on "regulating the use and benefits of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"when it is adopted by Parliament, users of social media in Egypt need to register with a government authority in order to be able to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be established that is responsible for granting citizens permission to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">Within six months with the adoption of the law users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and ID numbers in order to be able to use social networks.</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring about a penalty of up to six months in prison or a fines."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill consists of six paragraphs and in local media, including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, video guidance and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not give a clue about how Egyptian authorities should account for users who do not register, considering the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to regulate the regulation on the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattler, MP and supporter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users got a user name and a password from the telecommunications department to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of that, it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information to their identity in order to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it has not been known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on the spot are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research technologist at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights "), told Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things related to technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they are violently controlling physical public and private rooms, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, that means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter out citizens who are applying for authorisation or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a trial."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but in Egypt everything is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether his acceptance and enforcement will succeed or not, the draft" is consistent with a pro-military way of thinking in the Parliament, in whose sense the control is maximized and ensured that no deviating narration is present on the screen, "says Raoof."</seg>

<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger leopards, which streaks through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera Pardus saxicolor). altogether, it is endangered between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"how Raza shows in the video," is the Persian leopard the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem, "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on a large predator."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard indeed in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video determines that they have a shot of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>

<seg id="544">"in early March 2017, the daily Kahoku Shimpo, responsible for northeastern Japan, has paved the way to rebuild the lives of those affected by the" triple disaster "of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atomic accident in Fukushima had triggered the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper is based in Sendai, which is located in the prefecture of Miyagi. Miyagi prefecture was an alleged prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages of Fukushima and Iwate were evacuated by sevens because the tsunami had caused entire coastal cities to disappear from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition to this, Fukushima Prefecture had a nuclear accident, and alone for that alone, 160,000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"from a local perspective, the Kahoku Shimpo's special report shows what progress has been made six years later in order to rebuild the local residents' lives."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both the statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and the survey results of those affected.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the housing construction in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that by December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacement houses (for" "" "and" "" ") were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to record the greatest success among the three prefectures, where 80 percent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, while Fukushima forms the final light at 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"at the same time, six years after the catastrophe, evacuated housing estates (for" "" "and" "casetsu juutaku" ") were still endeavoring to relocate to final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in homes."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016 still 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"nearly 40 percent of the evacuated Fukushima evacuated in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the figure is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">"like the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper, 1074 of 1,100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 percent of the fishing ports in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of the fishing ports in Fukushima have resumed their operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"in the three prefectures of the agricultural land, the tsunami and the nuclear accident have affected large areas."</seg>
<seg id="564">Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural land; only 66 per cent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 per cent of damaged farmland can be used again in Fukushima.</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed farmlands of Fukushima are located in the" "nuclear barrier zone." ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima is far removed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are back at 90 percent on the same level, as before the accident. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only exhibit 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster almost half of the coastal inhabitants feel it is more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper carried out numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees. she asked them about the state of rebuilding and how their feeling against the tsunami risk has changed."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in its introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to learn more about the tsunami consciousness among the native population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents found that still not enough was done in disaster prevention."</seg>
<seg id="575">As it is about those who had to evacuate Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition marking the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation of Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the huge earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also witness to the worst, disastrous, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160,000 evacuees from Fukushima, almost 63 thousand people were displaced in areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 more than 23 000 people, back to Fukushima, were moved to permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"as of 2017, there are still more than 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the catastrophes most of the evacuees still in homes are older than 50 years old. they are well-known because efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima will have to compete with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="626">"with the introduction of the law of Alvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba shut the doors (photo: Julio Batista)"</seg>
<seg id="627">"Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, which is located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is generally known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill, despite the fact that there is no appreciable sugar harvest on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It was two years ago when the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralyzed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after being succumbed, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities, until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to invent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Other resigned and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">"Nene, a soldier veteran who stands up every day at 4: 00 am, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive him of his sleep."</seg>
<seg id="634">"he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are back in operation after a long inactive period, because they have been preserved."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene recalls exactly that in Mañalich the sugar cane factory would be preserved, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry has already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, bad management decisions and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"by 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the quantity produced in 1910."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the message would have been a motive for concern for the country several decades ago, but the bad harvests are not news anymore."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old railway platform of the municipality already saw better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">"the reduction of sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically deprecated, and hardly competitive they became unsustainable for the country."</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production targets amounted to 4 million tons."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for at most 4 Centauos (0.03 Euro).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution to unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motifs leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"nevertheless, the sugar price increased over a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"from 2017 to 2025, the price of unrefined sugars must remain between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound, according to the report published by the OECD and FAO, the Agricultural and Food Organisation of the United Nations."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if the current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), the raw sugar export would generate around 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>

<seg id="657">"when Nene, as he is known as a soldier, talks about closing the factory, the word he repeated most is" "scam." ""</seg>
<seg id="658">Almost all respondents are of the same opinion: not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down.</seg>
<seg id="659">"in order for the place to be preserved, they formed a full-time working group."</seg>
<seg id="660">"before the first year of closing, the first letters began to come."</seg>

<seg id="662">"all were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve any withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="663">"from then on, the responsibility was covered and the letters came more and more frequently."</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people from the First Nations communities across Canada focus on topics that are important to them. they do so by hip-hop thanks to a series of walking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile sound studios to schools and youth centres since 2014, to teach youth groups of songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were conducted by educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop concludes that the young participants are scrutinizing topics such as" cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self acceptance, "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are the inspiration for songs and videos in which young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the Winnebago tribe in the U.S. state of Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak'Yoo in the area of the trunk of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a road section in Western Canada, where nearly two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or were murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">"for the most part, the cases have not been solved."</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important it is to preserve traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always rule the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapleoostui Cree First Nation recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved received a little help from Gary Jolly from the Northstars hip-hop group, who gave them a verse in the dialect Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody ever is interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I'm trying to continue my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will take away our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because as youth we have lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise up one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">This is how they can grow and also advance our youth</seg>
<seg id="712">So they can do what they intended for the Creator.</seg>
<seg id="713">"in the comments section, the reader and proponent of the Cree-language Kevin Brousseau also contributes and adds the verse in syllabia (which is also published on his blog and is published here with permission):"</seg>

<seg id="718">"in Japan, one can see plastic dishes almost every restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="719">"in order to show potential customers what exactly is on the menu, they are presented in the vicinity of the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (for the '60s," "plastic models of the dishes" ") of any food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers see these plastic dishes and decide whether they enter the restaurant or continue.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">The German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented the German filmmaker Wim Wenders in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them. however, a new trend turns them into striking cell phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">"at Naver Matome, the blogger itinii published a series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>
<seg id="725">Now in special sale: new cell phone bands decorated with plastic dishes as shown in the Kichijoji Tokyu department store.</seg>
<seg id="726">"many of these artificial foods were transformed into kitschy collective objects, as in this case, fridge magnets:"</seg>
<seg id="727">Here are some Shokuhin fridge magnets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="728">The new boom in food supplies is becoming increasingly complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, an Emen-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was turned into a cell phone stand."</seg>
<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a cell phone support.</seg>
<seg id="731">This part was also produced for the exhibition in Tokyo Station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And that's just the beginning of an increasing approach to the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some cellphone racks and cell phone designers allow you to create your own artwork. in this case, ikura or laughing is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"someone who would say:" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my cell phone with salmon." ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">This interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form in order to surprise co-workers or family members unpleasant.</seg>
<seg id="740">Our latest cell phone stand has the form of melting ice.</seg>
<seg id="741">"in addition, there are also rice balls (Onigiri), earrings and hand-ribbons made of dried salmon."</seg>
<seg id="742">"for more bizarre plastic dishes, please visit: itinii's Naver Matome blog post. or follow the hashtag # 1 for the hashtag # 6 for the" "Hashtag #" "on Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="743">"if you would like to learn more about the origins of this trend, this video gives you an insight into the district of Kappabashi, which is dedicated to supplying the restaurant industry. for example, with the shokuhin sanpuru."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico the missing and killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not at all reflect the extent of the human tragedy that entails this struggle."</seg>
<seg id="750">"the reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the head of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pushed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"the day after a violent incident, hardly anybody looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each corpse, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret tombs, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"therefore, the Mexican news portal Animal Político has launched the digital project" aprender a Vivir Con El Narco. ""</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime not only lets us fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities need to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear changed lives") tells the story of these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret tombs for his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father, her four siblings, her husband and two of her nephews in just one day."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "like every Sunday we prepare ourselves today for the task we have set ourselves to go and search for tombs, according to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electrical shop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th, he should be back again, but he never came back." Emma Veleta said: "it is very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need education."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me as well."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are entitled to the insurance of my father, but it doesn't pay them out, because they demand a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where shall we come here? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this article from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be considered normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and sensational journalism for a number of years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I come by newspaper kiosks and see the pages with pictures, which can actually only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one who is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent about it or consider it to be normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin considers that he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealer) when he is big. and it's not normal that people listen to songs about the" "heroic" "of the offenders when they walk through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me, it is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone and those who fear that something has happened to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere figures in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"man's lack of action is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village could be justified by the fact that they were" "soaked." ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to convince themselves that they will be spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and still."</seg>
<seg id="790">Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article "Four months of blackmail in the main city district: how a family has been plundered by threats."</seg>
<seg id="791">"you think of all that you have lost, and how many people can completely change all your lives in just a few days."</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of this never passes, the trauma will remain, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact you when it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She included her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when to kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these awful days whether crying would dissolve my deeply rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega has published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation of violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">"in the introduction, he raises questions such as: who cares for the child of a missing woman and a man murdered by organised crime?"</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow up in a settlement on the edge of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is an orphan and he says he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, roast potatoes, make tortillas warm and make" "chichi" "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the bottle with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for every year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom all life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was already past two years before, when he saw only a few blocks from his home, the bloody corpse of his father, which was shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"when Bryan was born, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">"Bryan was born in 2006, when violence was violated by organised crime and the struggle against the already existing social problems in Juárez."</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Council of Public Safety and the Government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor called 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Morde per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of the hundreds of thousands of stories that leave organized crime in Mexico and penetrate the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose objective is to present the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist further."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let us take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its initial publication, it has been misled to portray tragedies that actually took place in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false coupling of image and event -" fake description "or" false context "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample accurate coverage of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for images to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010 a tank truck crossed the town of Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tipped around and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second-largest country had been neglected for years and ravaged it. the roads in the region became dangerous paths filled with potholes that were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, the fuel tank collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball rolling dozens of houses including a cinema close by, which was full of people watching the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned to the unknown.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture entitled" "This is Nigeria". "from the Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of charred bodies that are strung on the ground while people watch it.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here history does not end its end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was recorded several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and falsely attributed to real but not associated tragedies, especially in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What happened in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, fighters from the Boko Haram attacked the remote Nigerian towns of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses dramatically reported atrocities they had to flee from.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." no one stayed behind to count corpses, "said a Residents to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many had been dismembered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the attack remained unresolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by the Boko Haram to win land (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the image from DR Congo appeared again when it was wrongly presented as evidence of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from DR Congo is only one in a series of misalignments; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the image was presented as a proof of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one more step further, personal commentaries such as this example mistakenly address the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image from Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a lightning report published by the United Nations, those who could flee could flee blows, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against Rohingya, posts like the following appeared, bringing together these descriptions with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture was taken from an Saudi Arabian news page, which was falsely claimed by President Burma's Than being, monks and politicians participated in the assassination of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from DR Congo to capture this information."</seg>

<seg id="919">Instead the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage in comparison to Nigeria and the attack on Charlie Hebdo.</seg>
<seg id="920">"Vietnam (Indonesian), 2014."</seg>
<seg id="921">"after a message allegedly written by a" father Juan Carlos Martos "about the Nigerian massacre, there were discussion forums like this in Vietnamese and declared it a false announcement."</seg>
<seg id="922">"from the Embassy in which the image from DR Congo was included, the organisation of the Claretine Missionaries and Fr. Juan Carlos Martos distance themselves."</seg>
<seg id="923">"there are further confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden, Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Argentina."</seg>

<seg id="926">"in all these cases, which appeared only clearly after the original accident of 2010, the picture eventually bears a correct description, but the original contribution is not available or accessible."</seg>
<seg id="927">Frames and images</seg>
<seg id="928">There are two strong issues or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photograph was used in relation to greater discussions about the silence in connection with the murders of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassinations of Rohingya by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the picture to discuss how an African life is underrated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>
<seg id="931">"to understand religion and the value of human life is both important. therefore, it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts."</seg>
<seg id="932">"a deeper question, however, is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images."</seg>
<seg id="933">"with social media, there are tens of people who unintentionally share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"this mood suggests false and false information, that actual atrocities are untrue and defies the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent imagery has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that keeping images of a refusal is equal to the recognition of the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even required by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent images can desensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which examined how violent media work towards helping others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there are some discussions about violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against" fake news. "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which an image suggests something, but what can actually be used diverted from the context or in completely improper way."</seg>
<seg id="940">"however, each investigation of false attributions should also take into account how internationally it can be."</seg>

<seg id="943">Photo by Andy Simmons uses according to CC BY-ND 2.0 license.</seg>
<seg id="944">A blog with the name untranslatable (e. g. irreplaceable) strives to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from around the world that are difficult or not to translate at all.</seg>
<seg id="945">There are such words in each language: they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific.</seg>
<seg id="946">Some of these confusing words are already well known today (like the famous Portuguese saudade) and others deeply rooted in a special culture (such as the Spanish sobrimeta).</seg>
<seg id="947">But all resist stubbornly every attempt of a simple translation.</seg>
<seg id="948">"a word or expression is not enough, which is why a full explanation and sometimes a context are needed to understand exactly what is meant by this one word."</seg>
<seg id="949">These unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list.</seg>
<seg id="950">"most of these lists treat Japanese, German, French, Portuguese or Finnish words while the author and linguist of" untranslatable "Steven Bird has decided to concentrate on small languages."</seg>
<seg id="951">"for example, in the blog you can find words from the VAT language of Vanuatu, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="952">Vakasteglok "- Sealed to your parents in recognition of how they tried to take care of you in your younger years.</seg>
<seg id="953">"words in the Hunsrik language spoken in parts of Brazil, such as:"</seg>
<seg id="954">Kwadi "- The comfort or laziness you feel after getting warmed up in the sun on cold days.</seg>
<seg id="955">In Birds's own words from his blog About:</seg>
<seg id="956">"they defuse other cultures, reveal other thoughts, and awaken our curiosity."</seg>
<seg id="957">"sometimes you influence how we analyse and classify the world around us and classify the linguists on this page to publish more of these" confusing "words, showing how different, valuable and impressive these little languages are."</seg>
<seg id="958">"speakers of the Treasure Languages, which are highly valued by untranslatable, are invited to upload their favorite words here."</seg>

<seg id="1155">"with the aim of re-testing the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounts to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations participated in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (civic front for the neural exam of debt) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of refixing the debt have also submitted a petition to the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Ricos demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debt are held responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we demand a financial review and a management committee without personal interests in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding compensation, which acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">Puerto Ricos people refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to reconcile themselves with falling pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>

<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ricos requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"without the participation and conviction of citizens, measures imposed on the outside will be in danger of being rejected by the people."</seg>

<seg id="1186">"Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the French-based CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, Managing Director of Book Sprints, a publishing house produced by so-called 'Book Sprints', read excerpts from the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Surgical Research)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is available here royalty free, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a homage to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">"in the introduction, it is said:"</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how to build movements for free knowledge and what is the real cost associated with this.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who participate in the movement for free knowledge have worked side by side to look over the fog that surrounds our news feeds and to create some sense from our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">His name was removed from the Adra prison directory where he was sitting on 3 October 2015.</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current status or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">The introductory part of his book with the title Collective Remembrance gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and want to know him back in his normal life and freedom.</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have started to think about their own destinies, deeds and choices."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of at times extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The Open Source and digital activist web developer has been in the custody of Syrian government authorities since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred to an unknown place from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer, Noura Ghazi, reported that the" "military police" "Bassel had taken on the basis of a command of the military court from his cell in Adra."</seg>
<seg id="1203">Ghazi reported that she was contacted by persons who presented themselves as the insiders of the Assad government on 12 November 2015 and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband.</seg>
<seg id="1204">But his whereabouts remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowing for the general public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry, a designer, technologist, and currently the head of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basle's cultural prototypes was more proactive than the work he began with a group of archeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations, and here Greek-Roman architectural types merge with local traditions and Persian influence."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel could not yet know that ten years after he began with this work, the IS would put everything on it, to wipe out the architecture that embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but of the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this expedition into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"unfortunately, Bassel has not yet finished this project."</seg>
<seg id="1212">"Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about her husband's passion to share his knowledge with others, even during his time in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life in dreaming of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with anyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a Provisional Application she wrote in the years 2012 to 2015 her husband when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available licence-free.</seg>

<seg id="1230">"that I lose the senses in the moment we embrace,"</seg>
<seg id="1231">"that I don't care about any of the dangers,"</seg>
<seg id="1232">"each of the fences, shackles and watchmen"</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the prisons of the prison</seg>

<seg id="1237">And I leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">"I quickly turned back to my solitude,"</seg>
<seg id="1239">"to reclaim all the moments,"</seg>
<seg id="1240">And cry and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I bear witness to myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">"on the first anniversary of Bassel's imprisonment, Ghazi wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="1243">"a year goes by, my soul"</seg>

<seg id="1247">Basle's story is not unique in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="1248">"since the protests in 2011 against Bashar al-Assad's regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights)."</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under the regime of violence were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">"by 2016, at least 17,723 Syrians have died in detention according to the international human rights organization Amnesty International."</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">"today, we reiterate our call for the hope that we have to do this for the last time."</seg>
<seg id="1254">Mosambique: corruption-convicted director after release from prison on previous post</seg>
<seg id="1255">"with anger, Mozambique reacted to corruption in which a government member returned after half of his sentence to the workplace in the state apparatus in which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this was Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and, together with four other defendants, sentenced to 22 years in prison in 2010 along with four other defendants."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the airports of Mozambique, the Council of which was presided by Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company which happened on 19 April.</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which evaluated the application, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to resume his old post as the company did not undergo any disciplinary proceedings after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many people don't like the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Pública, CIP), a local institution engaged in public transparency, condemned the company's decision to put the director back on:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and exemplifies the lack of transparency and is even a step backwards with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also initiate a disciplinary proceedings against the infringement.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company apparently kept silent and did not make appropriate legal steps to apply the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behavior and considers the case as" "refuted" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent type, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of whom had been sucked."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid talks and motivational speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped to harm."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"consequently, it is obvious: Cambaza will gladly pay for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">It is disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Mozambique student and student of political science in Brazil says the director has no moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I can't believe that you are rewarded in such a way that has already massively insulted the state."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morals to return and to serve the state * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served by the state itself."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as if it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man, who was charged and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeút prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to recall that a thief is in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves are in prison Samora Machel will not only be remembered as the first independent president for the Mosambique, but also as sharp, single-edged and, by the way, a prophetic speaker."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral presentations was when he energetically confirmed that" "an ambitious person is capable of anything, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it is not so. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions. "</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious person is criminal at the same time. "</seg>
<seg id="1281">"in Twitter, the reactions were also negative:"</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censuses many users wrongly</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or splits.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the familiar social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although discussing the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or used in general as an adjective" "Indian". ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "for" "(in Burmese writing) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word used mostly by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"today Kalar may normally be associated with racism, but the word itself does not automatically call forth hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts where they have discussed the use of the word, or have expressed doubts about the purpose of their use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with different meanings, which have the same character sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, it is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae' (splitting bse), 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalar hair' (Curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by doing a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the proposition ku la -" cure "(ku) + the question (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were various reactions to the Facebook initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is of the opinion that she will reduce hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before solving all the posts that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook doesn't delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you are writing on Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyse the post and check it by checking the next words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">For example "Kalar Htine" (chair) and "Kalar pae" (splitting shells).</seg>
<seg id="1310">The good thing is that these dirty nationalists who spread hate speech will receive a fairly good lesson.</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all who disseminate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have proven that the censorship of keywords is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks can simply start using a new word or alternative notation of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts when he just wanted to share his friends, that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new rule of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was banned from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours, because the post" didn't meet the Facebook community standards. "</seg>
<seg id="1317">"Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions, or who simply try to show their opinions on hate speech of radical nationalists."</seg>
<seg id="1318">Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed that has nothing to do with hate speech:</seg>
<seg id="1319">Mail without hate speech removed from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">In the post the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad.</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook is supposed to have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook may have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma by its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they started this without local context or technical support and have banned words like" "stools" "or" "pea curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the falsified posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook's automatic censorship has caused a lot of mockery among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now laugh about Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts that didn't contain hate speech, but removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">Used with permission.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads "I want to sit on a chair and watch pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">Only to check if Facebook removes the mail containing the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"the post says" If you are a doctor, do you heal people? "</seg>
<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists have used social networks to expand their voices and influence."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should accelerate violence in the communities of Myanmar in addition, especially in the area Rakhine where confrontations between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">Facebook has been criticised for his failure to take control of the rampant hate speech on his Burmese pages.</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at the context rather than code concentrating initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tension in this actually uncomplicated thing, and at some point there came doubts as to whether the opposition would agree with the bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but early 2017, the draft law against the children was decided - in spite of 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who abstained, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>

<seg id="1393">"for more than a month, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">"day after day, it becomes clearer how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and TV series fans defend themselves against the blockade.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many tech-savvy internet users are used to use bypassing tools for blocked websites (an up-to-date article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN-prevalence of the world), most of the ordinary wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as described recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockings of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (No. 5651) has been adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains locked, there are now several mirrors (pages that reflect the content of Wikipedia and frequently updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform cleared all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. computer host connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"despite the legal prohibition, the content is available."</seg>
<seg id="1402">In a blog post IPFS reports about his efforts:</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the news (about the locking of Wikipedia), we set out everything to take snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. thus, it is possible to read the content in a decentralized and distributed way."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia articles, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia.org."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also stated that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and only screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to bypass the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansicyclopedi.org, a Mirrorseite of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar mirror sites when locked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>

<seg id="1411">"essentially, the server will guide the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia themselves if they are locked in Turkey."</seg>

<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurry with poorly positioned motifs and well-balanced colors.</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to bury the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar tries to bring Neptune fauna to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, right next to Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this prime location helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live on the edge of the Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I was just sitting at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of the Chitwan Lake Lodge) suddenly called me. he had received a call from my father that a leopard would be on the bank of the Rapti river.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The River damm is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran off with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father had observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately started to kneel pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">"Sagar seeks cooperation with the authorities in order to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune nature, and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look."</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he ought to know, for he stood before Tigern face to face,"</seg>

<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" "I click for conservation" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife, however, is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, and mostly lived in a tent to take pictures of Ottern in the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds that live near the tourist dwellings."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyanwala and originally appeared on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version has been published here as part of a content-sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women with great care must avoid the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh women admit that due to social pressure they should respect the husband, as well as the fear of the consequences they should despise the norm, keep this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian State of Odisha and rejected by her family and the village community after addressing a married family."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"tradition their wives also do not name their wives by name, is also common among men. however, they have far fewer warrants to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of the 56 clubs that exist in 13 Indian states, he is part of the campaign # KhelBadal, which is operated by the Community Video Volunteers and advocates for the degradation of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"for seven years Rohini Pahas been working with her video camera to expose clues, such as children's marriage, to the exile of HIV and AIDS infected individuals, and directs this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video that Rohini showed in her discussion, was of women who don't name their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this topic because she wanted to open the conversation about the patriarchy with a problem with which women can easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"the names of their husbands do not speak loudly, is a custom that they have all dutifully upheld and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not hold this is considered as deceitful as a woman without morals.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"in the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband in the name of her husband, wanted to try out at home."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband kept silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said I should call him henceforth by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started their first discussion with this self-confidence in the luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she all asked," "If we can't tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, does that mean they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they took the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paist from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about breaking an age-old tradition in which married women never allowed to pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini told:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that during the whole exercise she only kicked in front of him, and another decided to release all the accumulated frustration against him and his family by cursed him."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on her faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I'll never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"in the adrenaline rush of having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to name their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the coming days, Rohini received a number of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked which ideas she put the women in his head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it at dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she got scared and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini said I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation violated violence.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing a zinc-red dot on the forehead, which indicates the marital status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband that I would wear the zinnobred dot, if he would do it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed and I stopped wearing him.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip at every discus club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Usually we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to take care of who could hear what they hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">"in the last months, for the first time in their lives, they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never imagined before."</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so sincerely about some things, such as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things loudly, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a discussion round, we talked about the concept of honor and how it is related to clothing."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most people this is okay, but some wanted to wear a lettuce, a wide shirt over a pant; they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after a lot of arguments and discussions about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, the morality associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion lap so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will get it."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"according to the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini affirms that things are slowly rolling:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only done small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a couple of times, but then again stopped telling the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including myself, still do it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are involved."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberred on their foreheads.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or their own choice of clothes - lie at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain raw ini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I'm too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman enters the club home and tells other people what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>

<seg id="1629">"the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident Liu Xiaobo attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized due to liver cancer, at the end of June."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment for" "Subversion" "(state endangerment) after he had participated in the design of the Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the State Department in China referred to Liu's case as an" "internal matter" "and told a speaker that he deemed it" "not deemed necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China still receives appeals from the international community, the Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him a treatment abroad."</seg>

<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were resumed only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon exports to China, as exports were largely blocked since 2010."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news had spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>

<seg id="1654">"the U.S. Embassy's request attracted a furious response from China, with the statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley said that China should offer the following to the couple:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom, such as travel freedom and access to the medical care of his choice, to which they are entitled to the Chinese Constitution and the legal system, as well as international obligations."</seg>

<seg id="1666">McCallum continues to tell:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"Canada calls on China to uphold its international human rights obligations, including freedom of expression, and liberate those campaigning for the exercise of these rights."</seg>

<seg id="1676">"the spiritual leader in Tibet, the Dalai Lama, was very concerned in a statement on 28 June about Liu and said that many asked him to pray for Liu's well-being."</seg>
<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or a country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may appear stupid as Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice, K. Shanmugam, Singapore was to be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has sparked a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"during the meeting of the international branch of the New York State Bar Association meeting, the minister noted that many people criticised the dominance of the only political party in Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries."</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York was a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is what most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious country, one hears that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very classy: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of that, he seemed inevitably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore was to be compared with cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"as soon as one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old lyre appears to emerge from authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leave the twisted logic, as it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the responses given by Shanmugam last week to his American guests with regard to our press, our judicial system, and our political system were really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He disguised such questions with non-answers of rational nature.</seg>
<seg id="1704">Rachel Zeng calls on Shanmugam to clarify his opinion because she did not understand this conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1705">Personally I find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs to our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clear up this point, provided he was paid high to be part of the government of Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out to the critics that one should start reading the full address of the conference to better understand the context of the statements of Shanmugam, according to which Singapore is a city and no country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the full address.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so uneasy even if we enjoy free and fair elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party winning for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore was not a country," he obviously didn't mean it in this sense! "</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">I am very embarrassed about what the minister of Justice of Singapore said...</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I doubt and I'm not even sure if he really believes it, properly associates and is aware of what he is defending."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review disintegrates Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"has Mr Shanmugam" "believed a mistake" "or was it a Freudian speaker?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only seen as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, on which country are the sovereign rights of Singapore going back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the cabinet of government, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of grave importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore make their military service, do they not defend their city, but their land?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister have to pay bills?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink ID card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the Journey of a Decade magazine tends to bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I didn't say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">No one ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country especially "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather speak of the defense of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp 'nice'.</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: to be described as being" "nice" "means being diligently - like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpsons "(who has a Canadian Doppelgänger.)"</seg>

<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs.</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez directs a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1896">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1897">"this article by Amy Bracken was published on the website of our partner PRI.org on April 19, 2017 and appears here with friendly permission."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is run by a 59- year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink brillar frame and golden earrings in a teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about $2.50 the night the guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">"in the anteroom, there is a parrot in a cage."</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - but there are hundreds of African and Haitian immigrants coming here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez tells us that people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast begin to cry out:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you Mama Africa?.</seg>
<seg id="1910">"currently it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some also have slept outdoors on boxes."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to refuse anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are sick, she buys them drugs that they cannot pay, she massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychque Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mum Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the Sebastiao family (with their daughter Merrui, who has a Joghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have already lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move northwards."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard about Mama Africa's other companions." Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track, "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans are often travelling together and that the Africans are already talking about Ms. Ramírez's Whatsapp.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet has lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the necessary money to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will be in contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never leave her again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">"Mrs. Ramírez tells that her guests often send text messages when they have gone to greet them, or to report her about the course of their journey."</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the drive of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken as in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Ms. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city is a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their little house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African immigrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after living for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants who travel through Tapachula comes from central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single educator, offered him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is full of guests again.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, travelers will calmly consult their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part from Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic because of those who have gone away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she smoothes her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair-lichen she has made a customer, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly while she imagines her briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats every time. "they have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjang by Twitter users,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in Western China, are forced to install a spyware on their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi got a mobile notification in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" Web Cleaning ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the announcement, it is said that the app is preventing access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities may also use the app for more than combating terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they, shortly after they had installed the app, had exchanged news with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police reported that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" malicious information "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwang's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a service achievement with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, from online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online, and to remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the ors for minors should help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate the home network of a person or steal from it."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is consistent with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while notifications about digital censorship in China usually focus on the experience of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to restrict unrest and discontent in the conflict areas, the authorities often impose extreme censorship and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the Twitter-based media outlet" Images from mainland China "(" "Enrolment" "), published censored news in China, showed photos of a checkpoint where police checked the residents indiscriminately whether they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjiang make sure that people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification asked people to install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are discovered at a checkpoint with a device without this software, you might be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest-keeping technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"in addition, a Jingwang product description, out of which the software can unlock the password requirements of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive, also published a Jingwang product description."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The provisions in Jingwang may be a reaction to the instructions of the city council to minimize the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and related institutions, including universities and research institutes, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office during the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent report by Freedom House, an American human rights organization, also mentioned these new monitoring methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities issued a decree on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi an ordinance with the directive to all residents and entrepreneurs to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks, and media memory cards "at local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intent is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos. "however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them punishments for a whole range of other possible offences, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1994">"this is the first of six reports in the" "sleep or death" "series where the activist Sarmad Al Jilane portrays his experiences in a Syrian prison."</seg>
<seg id="1995">"far from our blue, virtual world you look at and realize that you are alone in a place where everything has disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="1996">Everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth that is clearly recognizable from inside and outside.</seg>
<seg id="1997">One that glorifies their name.</seg>
<seg id="1998">One that has broken down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but if reality recovers you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama, the beautiful scenes and the actors - the characters are transformed into beings of flesh and blood, and everything cries after death."</seg>
<seg id="2000">"all doubts settle into smoke and you become aware of your existence, even if the earth turns on on the axis of the evil. you realize that you are trapped between the walls that your parents, and before them your grandparents, stone around stone."</seg>
<seg id="2001">"they arrested me and my father three times, but that wasn't enough for me to" learn my lesson, "as the chief of the security minister said - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure."</seg>
<seg id="2002">He demonstrated his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew.</seg>
<seg id="2003">Five teenagers were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like weeds.</seg>
<seg id="2004">It was sufficient that the city tore the darkness of the night with "Allahu Akbar" screams.</seg>
<seg id="2005">"all the neighborhoods were coveted, but not my own."</seg>
<seg id="2006">"for the first time it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even though I did not put high demands on a city that has been stuffed into the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"in the third night, things had a little calming down after the power supply in the neighborhood stopped working."</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke through the silence by screaming "Allahu Akbar" several times from my roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice resisting the silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">A few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, true friends joined me; we allied to a magnificent image filled with my expectations."</seg>
<seg id="2013">"in such a moment you become aware that you release the mind from the lamp, but it simply doesn't interest you in the least."</seg>
<seg id="2014">"I received a call from my father:" get ready, we meet at the military security building. "</seg>
<seg id="2015">He laid up.</seg>
<seg id="2016">Then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can return your voice after you have screamed them all the way to the office of the Security Service.</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">"the colonel Ghassan stood there with several of his men; my father was already there, as I am now."</seg>
<seg id="2019">"the colonel Ghassan begins to speak:" let me also hear how you scream "Allahu Akbar," or you are only brave enough to scream when we are not near. "</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes were shining upon me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"and you're really grieving, looking into my eyes and not on the ground!"</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was due to my folly, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my thing when I replied: "I would not have thought you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I've never stopped looking at you, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest entertainment that could have such disastrous consequences for me, and yet I do not regret a word of what I have said."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put it in solitary confinement, and his father immediately with it."</seg>
<seg id="2029">"the same with his father."</seg>
<seg id="2030">The stench of this cursed set is up to this day in the nose.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"he became a" syndrome, "a psychological torture that I was subjected to months for months."</seg>
<seg id="2032">I went through the courtyard.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in the first office, I leave everything I carry with me."</seg>
<seg id="2034">Then back through the courtyard and into the second office which leads through a hallway to the individual cells.</seg>
<seg id="2035">I'll take a look at all the details before I enter the room.</seg>
<seg id="2036">Otherwise they have probably assigned me a larger cell this time.</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I must share them with only one other prisoner, and I must immediately set myself without waiting for their permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes, which felt like a whole life, the official left the cell and I resorted to an old-established communication method: beating the fist against the wall."</seg>
<seg id="2039">I learned that my cell-mate was a "self-styling."</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he finally replied.</seg>
<seg id="2041">"apparently in none of the surrounding cells there was a respectable middle-aged man, who looks similar to me and called" the doctor. ""</seg>
<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness no prominent factions can be seen in me, and there are no doctors here; we are all just numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">Maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine?</seg>
<seg id="2044">All the answers deny its existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells.</seg>
<seg id="2046">Perhaps he will stop immediately.</seg>
<seg id="2047">"the investigator assured me that they would release him, if I remain."</seg>
<seg id="2048">Liars.</seg>
<seg id="2049">"I would have liked to have a scarecrow to remove all these crows, which are labelled by the fruits in the garden of my head."</seg>
<seg id="2050">"from the distance I hear them screaming" "Allahu Akbar". ""</seg>
<seg id="2051">"it must be around 10 o'clock in the evening; always at this time, the cries, every day."</seg>
<seg id="2052">The door opens.</seg>
<seg id="2053">"I was always convinced that black is the colour of perdition until I saw the yellow light that presented the horror in person: the Raad (for example:" thunder, "alluding to the 13th prostitute of the Koran)."</seg>
<seg id="2054">They are here to be interrogated.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus, the secret was lifted: to protect the state security against us and to prevent the betrayer and the terrorists in us, they speak in the alawitic dialect - thus they played their confessional blackmail and betrayed the narrow vision of their world view."</seg>
<seg id="2056">Here is no house that is not a land; it is a curse that they call coexistence to turn the criminals of their clan into a hero.</seg>
<seg id="2057">"I enter the listening room and meet Abu Imad, a slender and stocky man; at least he is coming to me."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"he starts a" pleasant "conversation, in spite of the expressions that suit him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more with your life than to join this diary and protest on demonstrations that will soon come to an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I did not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I've got used to it not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how that happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, even though I had done nothing to deserve this punishment."</seg>
<seg id="2064">Punishment in all their diversity.</seg>
<seg id="2065">His command is to pull me as much meat as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube that probably originates from the toilet.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot hold back your cries."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my cry was not enough for him, so they exchanged the pipe through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"at my first arrest, I asked myself whether the investigator had previously worked as a garbage collector, or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"they intertwined four cables intertwined to present us, from their point of view, a great invention of a giant cable."</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within one hour three of them alternated while I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost any feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I stopped screaming."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling and didn't really enjoy it, so he attacked an electrically charged rod as the next."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"electricity flowed through my entire body, enough to supply my whole district."</seg>
<seg id="2077">My half-naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor.</seg>
<seg id="2078">The deafness disappeared and the pain was back.</seg>
<seg id="2079">After two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night.</seg>
<seg id="2080">It must have been around midnight.</seg>
<seg id="2081">"I decided to sleep again; let's say, that was my only option."</seg>
<seg id="2082">"a few hours passed, which happened to me like minutes."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Then the call to the morning prayer.</seg>
<seg id="2084">"the door opens and the morning light fills the room." "aus mit dir, Arschficker."</seg>
<seg id="2085">"I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth:" "my Lord, my father must worry terribly."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"be quiet and move, you will be laid."</seg>
<seg id="2087">That was new.</seg>
<seg id="2088">Otherwise they had always left me free.</seg>

<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" "I think so because I am a man," "while he poured into water a Nescafé in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; during this time it is planned for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during the Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"apparently, Hdaib has a certain weakness in breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, having a cup of coffee on a scorching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the chimneys speak lukewarm coffee and the waisters of the Kent-cigarette in the nose mainly of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison in the open air, especially if you have a look at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to avoid basic things - as in the public during the Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Interior Ministry has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the MP and former spokeswoman of the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "just" "had been cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the involvement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is a dangerous activism, which issues the old-proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to opt for intellectual and cultural pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be just shallow rhetoric, but in fact reflected an increasingly evident reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib retreated traditional gender standards by making his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre-marital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">The picture shows the skeleton of an unknown woman whose arms and legs stretch to the corners of the screen.</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red sea, perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those whom they should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in recent years, the number of 'honour killings' has increased in Jordan - the inofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of honors in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still aggravating that Jordan lacks institutional infrastructure in order to support the women who have attempted murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law on crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "be detained for indefinite time in prison", "and for their release many years of bureaucratic expenditure and the guarantee of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Hdaib's music is also very popular and is well-known for not shy away from issues that have long been taboo in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics has been infiltrated me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib tackled the question of the Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">In "Lawla al 3aib" and in "Ghareeb" the focus again is on poverty.</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song titled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">"in this song, one verse often repeats itself:"</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where you, in his words," can get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He notes that hardly anyone in Jordan speaks about the rights of gay men and lesbians and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals have been heavily censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, in order to see later that his comments were torn from context, twisted, and had been censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed but only a revised version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is openly advertising the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance against homosexuals does not correspond to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nubia, a poet of the eighth century, still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib wonders: if Abu Nua, who would later work on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordaneer not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">In the hashemite kingdom there is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced.</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, Jordanian Intelligence held several former government officials and members of the teacher's association, arguing that commentaries in social media have been critical of the problems connected with the corruption deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, the Hdaibs concert is only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is how Hdaib - consists of slow, thought and inner changes. he is sure that these changes take place from day to day in the heart of Jordanian society."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"in the end, Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also to" experience it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, street unitions and democratically minded democrats. at least, he hopes."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until then, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant puppets puppets are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is assumed that it is a variation of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually also celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the feasts, the drums and dancing come over more than a thousand years and from a time in which armies from west Japan marched to the northeast to force the indigenous people of the region, the Emishi."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>

<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the trip to Aomori, the Nebuta Festival is the only true one - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:"</seg>

<seg id="2167">"outside appearance and body care were rare as in this story, as they help to keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession as those of the hairstyle."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to Lima's historic center - a region with a very high crime rate, where street robbery and illegal drug trafficking are commonplace."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, the appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Chile), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil) has resulted in getting more and more normal citizens into the seasoned hands of hairdressers who can recreate these complex hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the ultimate limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been held since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there, experts face each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as can be seen in the following video (more videos on current contests are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, which is located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to persuade young people to exchange their weapons against hair tools and to get a training in hairdresser art instead of bad advice that allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">Motivated by this activity and offering opportunities dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"before the school year starting in March, the school offered special training workshops and reported some of their successes:"</seg>

<seg id="2178">Colombia: letters of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsanve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">The following article is the edited version of the contribution "Love Message to guerrilla fighters" published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve.</seg>
<seg id="2182">The contribution will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel pushed out to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">The young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young-Youth Foundation didn't get out of their head and inspired them to write letters to the young people to write letters to the young people.</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently their country was the setting for a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had signed a peace treaty with the FARC guerrilla movement (German: revolutionary forces of Colombia), forming the conclusion of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace agreement was considered so significant that the Colombian president Jose Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of real reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters who have lived in illegal camps for many years, exposed to war rhetoric and carrying their weapons around the clock must now reintegrate themselves into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take in its ranks and support it in building a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would have to close together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">And that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerilla fighters to welcome them back to society.</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 Letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - to be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the Letters to Reconciliation was created at the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, but forget those who need them much more."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, who needed the most urgent response."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"up to now, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I never thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipal administration of Cali and Leonardo from the Bogotkind Foundation travelled to the camp to personally transfer the letters."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The members of the FARC were set up as they used to do in order to receive the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive commands, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for all involved." it's incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from anxiety to happiness, and everything in between, "explained the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the Province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former soldier led me through the camp of the guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambriches "(a kind of hut where the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go in, because next to him on the bed lay a MGL-Garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said to him," "Hello, what are they doing?" "he said," "I answer a letter someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"it was never in my life that someone wrote me such a beautiful thing, so I answered." "suddenly tears came to me about the cheeks."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him completely and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"maybe he was too sorry for the war, I was sorry to be all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life than war. to join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before starvation." "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know that there is a society out there waiting for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I only learned how to handle arms."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New Voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start of the event, students and some leaders of the FARC joined a discussion."</seg>
<seg id="2222">"the students were all grown up as already war, and the FARC was already in secret."</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the state affects the whole Colombian people. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worth overcoming all obstacles," "said one of them."</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"to listen to these people who had never heard, and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hate them, are only people with beautiful feelings that were turned around by their living conditions and their environment, was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people, including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former warriors responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, commander of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example, Darío de Jesús Monsalve, the Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Columbian people were prophesied that after the disarming of peace there would reign.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people willing to resort to arms, raise and protest for their rights."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we from the FARC now rely on peace, to a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and sacrifice, as we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"there will be many obstacles on our way, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with terror, campaigners have witnessed the recent months reporting about the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs like a damnation complaining about the local LGBTQ community has not been created overnight.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grozny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is happening in the Republic at this time."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has conquered the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that discuss the dragging, torture and killing of queer men in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Novaya Gazeta; she cast a light on the methods of the Chechen authorities suspected of queer men and put them in secret prisons in armgun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwife, was born in Grozny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt she was actually a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had experienced the gender equality of their fellow countrywoman, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"out of fear for her life, she finally moved to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I worked as a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent them to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" "then there are no men in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents through WhatsApp made the lap."</seg>
<seg id="2261">"on 10 October 2015, I was attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was about to fetch some shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," Here is a gift for you from your uncle. ""</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt myself."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard a phrase, but this time in Chechnyan:" how long will you still honor the family, you stain? ""</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and finally woke up in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">"apparently, some women had received everything and started to scream."</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two wounds in my right lung."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which wings were you placed, in which of the men or women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, my male name is still on it, but the doctor understood and laid me on the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I first read his name at his office door, I got to do it with the fear; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good man.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I received threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they demanded to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that all this was a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they showed absurd demands: some told me I had to prove it by going up without the streets; others wanted me to appear in the official TV in Grozny and say that I hadn't changed my sex, that everything was only naught speech, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once spoke to my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "They have brought a monster to the world, which has not only humiliated your family but the entire Republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a religious woman, but you have to disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"it was too much for my mother, and she put a cord around her neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbors came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">"at that time, I had to change the apartment several times a day."</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved into an apartment and a few hours later, under the window, there was a car with dark windows and a number plate with a 95."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something bad."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights activists checked the license plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you escape?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons, I don't want to reveal their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with their help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I still can't understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before I left Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother once I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering me, without identification, without knowing everything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment when I wanted to call my mother by WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't believe you're safe, just because you've left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. they even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality, that's a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this psychological barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually make a lot of effort to look at the person they remember from their past - that is, my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know anything about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">What do your friends do?</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report to Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who was eating in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he told that during the Ramadan people were not arrested and tortured, but also that all the Ramadan's end could hardly wait, and he did not exclude a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now focus on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"I mean, they probably invite the relatives, these take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand a proof that the so-called" "honor" "experienced by blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are gay men still held in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there were just not many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who have been dropped by their relatives to settle Kadyrow's judgment."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are detained there so that they can be presented later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim that they have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people had not simply disappeared, they were deliberately submerged in order to become radicalised."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is that just a guess, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote somebody who was imprisoned in Argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard grew.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them away.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, that person was himself when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports about this yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already taken place in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in Grozny when I was still there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In the serious!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, at that time it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia wanted to lead us originally to" "civilisation", "but ultimately threw us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is it possible under Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked, I had tinted eyelashes, wore tube jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never touched me just one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"before the Russian theater in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several benches were standing, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never insulted.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechnyan language there is a saying: Kharda ma Kharda. that is," Don't talk about the misfortune of another. ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">It is often said to be children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulted me, never hunted, and never struck me."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: until Kadyrow stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began to talk about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he did not talk about us per se, but above all about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, one could feel how people started to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">Those who had laughed and laughed before looked at you at once with suspicion.</seg>
<seg id="2369">In time I left Chechnya.</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I returned home, I could feel the situation in the republic steadily deteriorated."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity are you going to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I do not earn much - 700 to 800 dollars per month are not much in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="2374">Apart from that I am still active as a activist.</seg>
<seg id="2375">I am currently responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teetreffs, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't pay any cent for it for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I rang out places of refuge.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am a Muslim and wants to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hiddeab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's alright.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"nature, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Tschetschenen, who want to make you know with foam in front of your mouth that there are no bobbins with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the Kabardines have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they are - but" not in Chechnya. "</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who go to the mosque and fast in Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about transition to men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that is a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different ways - two different kinds of sensation, to be precise, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel myself in my own skin and not feel ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I'm going to be so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now more than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I'm not sad at all - I just know that I am myself now.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn against an increase in suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahrazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahraz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last months, there has been a strong increase in suicides."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Yasser Moramazi on August 27 drew the desperate situation of the Arab Ahwazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the limelight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the southwest of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who work in Ahwaz and wish to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he had ignited himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahraz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">According to local sources the burns were so strong that the doctors could do nothing more.</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred within the Arab Ahrazi minority in August, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Manifesto, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - hanged themselves."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: all the family fathers, who were helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution by the Iranian government, were helpless and unable to pursue a safe work."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahrazi suffers from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region in which a large part of the Arab Ahwazi-community living in Iran has been shattered by a profound economic crisis, which makes it difficult for the native Arab population to make a living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"one century ago, the Arab Ahraz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy took power and invested great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields in Iran, as well as some of the most productive and valuable useful areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the native population only receives little from this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often a victim of untreated illnesses, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically denies jobs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government also built a large number of dams, which divert water from the Arab areas to the Persian areas, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are lying."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness, and destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian General Director for Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahrazis, who are looking for a job, finished primary school, finished 55% of secondary school and have a university degree of 45%."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohii, an Iranian Ahrazi human rights activist based in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "in the number of suicide among young Ahrazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">"the reason for this is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians emerging from Ahraz, and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process:"</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since officials and institutions do not prefer to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance among young Arabs and forcing them to earn their livelihood outside their home country."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their affiliation to the Ahwazi, as even Arabic names at work are not tolerated, let alone the Speaking of Arabic language or wearing Arab clothes."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahrazi has to endure, human rights activist attacks raise alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">Why I don't identify myself with feminism</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by Pixabay. published under CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the website of Afroféminas. the article was subject to several discussions in which many different positions were expressed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves as intersectional feminists - react with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">"they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments before me, why I should be feminist and why we should be all feminist * within."</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women still earn less money these days than men."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">Violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still cause women to come across a glass ceiling earlier or later in various spheres of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still through the many different countries and faiths."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer twice and threefold."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been misused in racial segregation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" lift up their voices and "sing" my Lord "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about the fact that in addition to sexualized violence there is an institutionalized form of racist violence, which we expose black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic and country countries earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">The fact that black girls and girls with a migration background are more often referred to as white girls due to obvious integration problems.</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men, and all men of any skin color the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands, who refuses to consider injustices in her mind, which refers to both the sex and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my affiliation in a white-feminist oriented sphere that has always rejected me and countless other black women over and over again.</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to uphold an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical regard a dishonest and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups, who also absorb our customs and customs by cultural acquisitions in order to promote their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin colour and sex, as some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to teach them a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and differentiate themselves from white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to dissolve myself fully and completely from feminism, and to join the movement of the Womanismus, which was called into life for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever before that we define black women to our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanly: recruits (about: Africa-Womanism: how we recapture ourselves) speaks about how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also be worshipped in this way, in which the cultural, spiritual, psychological, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped which make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists would immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about the hypocrisy and contradictions of the feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women of other cultures, as in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">"because of my dark skin and my existence as a woman, I am recognized as a woman as part of this paradigm."</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can thrive in an environment where my life has neither passed over nor ignored nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddle against pollution: a man's mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this article by Todd Reubold was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine intrinsic about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content-sharing agreement, this article is published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"again and again Nabil Musa travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years, mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special request from the Kurdistan region of Iraq. his mission is aimed at making people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentary of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his church.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river we had lost when I was a child," "says Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of Waterkeeper Alliance - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, and to support local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarizes the urgency and importance of his work in one question:" if we had no more water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq-based documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work is on neglected, poorly attended subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with the help of suppressed communities that can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>
<seg id="2477">Paraguays women and their difficult fight against violence</seg>
<seg id="2478">A group of women portrays "the crying women" to express their pain on the women's morale in the country and in the region and to show their rejection.</seg>

<seg id="2480">"the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article" "The Wave of Violence Against Women in Paraguay" "of Kurzeme. the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# weighteinefraubin), which reports about the violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissar told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her spouse, who had become violent towards her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time had passed and the police said that their statement would be put on the files, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman Balbuena showed up because of abuse, the informed Ada Báez showed no advantage."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman withdrew her ad."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women file a complaint at all, they generally do not receive support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they mistreat. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence must report themselves at all to the law enforcement agencies."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"incens1 punches and statistical 2 invisible mistreatments and a legal system, which is nothing inferior to three Paraguays legislation: good approach, inadequate realization punches and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to see how many women are really abused, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay." "there are various reports and reports that do not even show the extent of gender-specific violence against women in Paraguay", "she explains."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"the numbers available, however, are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, 9600 ads participated in the District Attorney General's Office for domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the advertisements in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the peace courts. 86% of women were seen here as well.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the ads, 40% of women said that they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"these statistics, however, do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." "for every woman who is refunded in Paraguay because of psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"for every woman refunded for physical abuse, two women who do not do this," she explained at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's suicide is not a criminal offence in Paraguay, the law enforcement agencies cannot adequately document how many women are murdered by their current or former partners every year."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of women's suicide in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The Coordinator for Human Rights in Paraguay documented at least 37 cases in which women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, every ten days in Paraguay dies a woman due to violence by men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">"a sign with the inscription:" "without complicity, no impunity." "photo by Jessie Insfran Pérez. use with kind permission."</seg>
<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a judicial system that does not undermine</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the name of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want to do that, but then she gave up. this should be regretted for ever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today, Mariana is 28 years old and not together with Carlos. but for two years she endured the psychological violence on his part - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most evident:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would be a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that this only happens to women who are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report on the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming her name, she wrote posts on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people answered their contributions, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorically whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they liked this so long by Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It almost seemed as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who is not from Paraguay, fought with the authorities in Paraguay for almost eight years to prove that her former partner was abused."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Network Yo te Creo ("I Believe you") consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others don't do: they take the women's statements seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victorias case everything started with psychological abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her prosperous partner even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without results and also from their relatives, she received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an unpredictable legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguayay laws: good approach, poor implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the announcement of mistreatment is a way of resistance and a fight against corruption in justice", "Victoria Santos says."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was debated in the Paraguayan parliament, which was announced under the hashtag # Porellas (# fearing)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos movement (# NoAE) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law makes it possible to declare and punish Femizid as an independent criminal act as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"in this way, the legislative text has been modified in a number of ways in order to also gain members for the law that would be paving the way for the decriminalisation of abortions, which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the initial draft law had foreseen the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence must bear on their own, if they simply want to file a complaint and obtain a secure housing to impose the state."</seg>
<seg id="2534">Echauri argues that the law is not effective if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it:</seg>
<seg id="2535">"in Paraguay, abuse is seen as a part of interpersonal relationships."</seg>
<seg id="2536">A rethinking must take place here so that violence can no longer be seen as something normal.</seg>
<seg id="2537">"who is silent in the face of these facts, is complicit and contributes to the offence of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2538">We must cover such a long time until ill treatment is no longer considered normal.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"on 10 November 2016, the Law was adopted at the Paraguayan Senate. before that, parts of the law had been altered, including a passage that the partners called in cases of domestic violence to reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="2540">The opinions about the changes are taking apart.</seg>

<seg id="2588">"medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area, which addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons why there are two reasons for the need for locally performed medical research: firstly there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more severe consequences in Africa's poorest countries than elsewhere, and lack of investment for the research of these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research, carried out by African scientists, helps build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"he grew up in the 1990s in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic had first serious effects on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, initially in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>

<seg id="2598">Global Voices (GM): what is your research topic?</seg>
<seg id="2599">Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment the focus of my work is on the application of research results. I support the samba national program for antiretroviral therapy (ART) with laboratory tests.</seg>
<seg id="2600">"in addition, I am currently starting a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV, TB and other relevant pathogens."</seg>
<seg id="2601">GM: what do you think are the most important scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2602">How do they differ from those in Western countries?</seg>
<seg id="2603">RW: there are no basic research here. we only implement solutions that have been developed elsewhere.</seg>
<seg id="2604">"this has to change, otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being a mover yourself."</seg>
<seg id="2605">"the solutions we get are often not well usable in our environment, and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here."</seg>
<seg id="2606">GV: where does the financing and support come from?</seg>
<seg id="2607">Is it sufficient?</seg>
<seg id="2608">How easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects?</seg>
<seg id="2609">RW: from the USA and Europe.</seg>
<seg id="2610">The projects are supported differently.</seg>
<seg id="2611">It is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here because financing and development chances are better in other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2612">GV: how is the research infrastructure?</seg>
<seg id="2613">What are the obstacles in your routine research that you did not have before?</seg>
<seg id="2614">"RW: the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries. it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity, water and internet."</seg>
<seg id="2615">Laboratory equipment is expensive and it takes months to import it from other countries.</seg>
<seg id="2616">GV: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">RW: there is already interest but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods.</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GV: how large is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>
<seg id="2621">I have seen great students of all ages.</seg>
<seg id="2622">"there is need for special scientific training, starting at any age."</seg>
<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer science, big data, exploration of space, health care (non-communicable and contagious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this."</seg>
<seg id="2624">GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries based on your experience?</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: often, it is the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise that poses challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system that magazines can only make articles available for payment (the so-called" Paywall "), also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "Open Source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this entry by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine that reports solutions for environmental problems worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding Salad in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"his company offers 114 varieties, such as Outshucination, the first plant cultivated and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many sorts of lettuce it can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">"but at the beginning of the 2000, he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding."</seg>
<seg id="2633">"patents were applied not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the last few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or carrot varieties. due to this trend plant breeders, environmentalists and experts for food security are concerned about the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton is still cultivating lettuce, but it takes longer for it because its work is more and more difficult due to increasing restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's as if there's a boulder lying in a river in order to paddle me.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that right now, but it is a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think that these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new kind of salad because all the characteristics are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very careful and strives to not use any material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">"he has also joined a movement that is growing steadily in the United States and all over the world: open source breeding (" "open source" ")."</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have cultivated and ate red Roman salad of the Outshucination variety in the "glasshouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT sector and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (Initiative for Open Source seeds) is inspired by the free" "open source" "software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched in order to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to the fact that others can freely use the seeds they have cultivated."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they will not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open-Source "breeders only allow others who buy their seeds to breed their own varieties and not immediately cut it out - two aspects that are forbidden or prescribed by many plant patties."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since their start in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy prospects</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi board member, Jack Kloppenburg, control over seeds and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security as well as environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seeds, seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try not to use the latter or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasises that the "open-source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control of the seed industry," "he says."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"food sovereignty without the sovereignty of seed is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to making other seeds available free of charge, in contrast to patent seeds and plant traits."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights on plant material, which is therefore always limited."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"such estimates are not yet available for other plants, but experts such as Luby suspect that massive cultivated plants such as wheat are patterned in even greater style than salad or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A Matter of Visibility</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are grown in such a way that they exhibit specifically desired traits - from those by which their taste or colour is improved to such, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders takes over more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before, since the changing conditions caused by climate change are much less predictable."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-spokesperson Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the United States Department of Agriculture, the company is committed to preserving genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the notion that intellectual property supports other breeders because" patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come to the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing more material and expertise to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees the other: 20 years to wait, until a patent expel, certainly does not promote innovation."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"if you have to wait so long to breed plants that are adapted to the changing environmental conditions, you would have already lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"but the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain:" "independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us."</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"that is what drives us, and it will be impossible for us if we cannot continue to use the best and newest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"altogether, Morton interferes with the concept of patenting plant traits:" we do not really create the traits themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">"the plants form them ourselves, and as a breeder we have no idea how the plants do that."</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"there is another important aspect of plant breeding for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation produce herbicides, bred in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is just opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such as Monsanto) have patents, most smaller seed companies manage to survive without patents - either they reject the patent or they think it is too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salad in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"Morton is also convinced that breeders would be more innovative by avoiding crop patents:" "it looks like I am using my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent."</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue, because I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years themselves," he says. "with a patent, you are protected from competition for 20 years with a patent that makes it very easy for me to think." worldwide response "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"while the US seems to be a leader in the" "open source" "breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly throughout the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture introduces itself as a professional organization in the field of resource, an open source seed programme. to preserve the seed of traditional crops, the Centre cooperates with farmers and helps them grow new varieties that meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also helps them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organization Agrecol works on an open-source license, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(regulations for breeding differ from country to country, therefore the Ossi obligation cannot simply be adopted one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patented."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is up to the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos hosted a conference on" "Open Source" "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all over East Africa gathered to learn about the" "open source" "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for" Open Source "seed systems, explains that the organization currently builds a global alliance for" open-source "seed systems for which the official start-up should fall for planned next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"a consortium of environmental protection and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit development aid organization USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database on seeds and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, published a report from aid organizations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report highlights the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection that Luby von Ossi hopes that more people will soon see it."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"" "the movement for regional and ecological food has mainly paid attention to where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role here," "said Luby." "we are now trying to make people clear that there is still more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2735">"to block blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of blogs may not be meaningful for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"1) I managed to convey to me the feeling of a state of siege, a arrest, attempted assassination, unloading at the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">2) You have proven that I did not write for nothing. in other words: my words have influence if only on a small audience.</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post articles to avoid censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have blocked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave walk the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 06 August. this resulted in technical tests on networks of different Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"in addition, afte documented the blocking of providers by transferring internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in their research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such practice indicates the government's intention to continue blocking and filtering the content that Egyptian users might have access to.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"in addition, the situation is worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, by which the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which it can proceed to court against these acts."</seg>
<seg id="2748">Now the question arises: how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the censor and whom will it attack next?</seg>
<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in the war?</seg>
<seg id="2750">The inhabitants argue.</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day newspapers report in Brazil with dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot in school," "Every second day a police officer is murdered in Rio de Janeiro", "" "thieves robbed chemist with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air-Atlantic to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the 2017 violence in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian NGO Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become commonplace and this is unacceptable & # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"in this way, the" Extra "newspaper, known for the detailed reporting on violence in Rio on 16 August, published the editorial" This is not normal "in which she announced a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city will now be published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explains the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"it will continue to report on crimes that happen in every big city in the world like murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, however, deviated from the civilized standard and what happens in Rio will be published in the column" "war in Rio". "(...) This is our way of crying: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four-minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not an occasion for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognize the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a newspaper journalist explains that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper writes on:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, if distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police that first shoots and then asks questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">But we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police whose aim is not the civilian population but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners.</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, the journalist Cecília Oliveira, on the other hand, argues against the violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and smug neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">"as a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than just its capital."</seg>

<seg id="2777">"according to Cecília, Rio de Janeiro is wrong, according to Cecília:" 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are in the north and northeast of the country according to the statistics of 2015. these are the most up-to-date available data. "</seg>
<seg id="2778">None of these cities is located in the state of Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="2779">"when we look at the murders per state, Rio is in place 16," she writes. "</seg>
<seg id="2780">"according to the company Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília emphasizes, has been repeating the state's security policy for years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003, was one of these security policy measures."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decline of violent deaths. but after several years, the UPP was increasingly under fire after several reports on chicans and repression against the poor congregations, which should actually protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, journalist João Paulo Charleaux selected one of his articles from 2010, explaining why the violence in Rio does not correspond to the criteria defined by the Geneva Convention - the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal questions, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also causes serious consequences for people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to use means and means that are typical of war. this includes penetration into the territory of a" enemy, "in which a civilian is an obscure point in the landscape and becomes an object for" collateral damage "and" lost spheres. ""</seg>
<seg id="2787">"war back or forth, the fact is that the inhabitants of the favelas continue to suffer in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2788">"a week ago, the police performed the mountain with the favela Jacarzinho to avenge the death of a policeman."</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and in the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer from brutal sieges and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Worldwatch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege both in Damascus and the surrounding country, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the region of Eastern Ghouta is particularly affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on August 21, 2013 demanded the lives of hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition are assuming that the massacre of the Assad regime was perpetrated on the basis of UN investigations and other human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebel-controlled areas have been under siege outside Damascus, leading to the fact that inhabitants are dependent on locally produced or through tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"through the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unreachable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a countermeasure, a group of Syrian humanitarian helpers and academics teaches the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own fungi as a" life saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">"fungi do not belong to the traditional foods planted in Syria, and are only very rare in the Syrian cuisine. however, their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the right of the project, Abo Nabil, said vis-à-vis the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we opted for the cultivation of mushrooms, because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and basements."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices, that for three years already fought to make this project known and expressed its relief that it now gains more and more."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to give 125 families knowledge of the plantation of mushrooms, says Dr. Leila to Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around €12,700, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, the 4th of September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative is dependent on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"due to the fuel shortage, locally produced plastic fuels are used to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila told Global Voices that they began" "production of fungal seeds originating from the regions" "before checking out their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have created a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after further 3 months, they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in Eastern Ghouta free of charge."</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a greater movement.</seg>

<seg id="2833">Several hundred people protested on 21 October in many regional capital cities in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal in the week before.</seg>
<seg id="2834">"forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October, which resulted in the last week of solidarity with the victims of solidarity with the victims for 3 days."</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires were also recorded in Galicia in Spain, where there were 4 dead."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 breakouts, which spread to the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occured in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system monitoring the forest areas by satellite photos alone in 2017 in Portugal, about 500,000 hectares of forest are burned - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>
<seg id="2839">So that you can make a better picture of the seriousness of the situation: there is no fire only in 4 districts.</seg>
<seg id="2840">"Portugal burns literally in the truest sense of the word # PrayForPortugal - nata, (@ a _ ataner) October 15, 2017"</seg>

<seg id="2844">The predictable tragedy</seg>
<seg id="2845">The aim of the Saturday's protests was the demand for better preventive and fire fighting measures by the state.</seg>
<seg id="2846">People wondered why the Civil Defence was unable to curb the extent of the tragedy as far as possible</seg>
<seg id="2847">João Soverel of the government of farmers of Portugal declared the newspaper Público:</seg>
<seg id="2848">"after Pedrógão, streets and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2849">This Sunday they did not do this: there are dozens of reports of open roads that were enclosed by fire.</seg>
<seg id="2850">"in the forest of Leiria a similar tragedy would have happened in June, as the streets were closed very late."</seg>
<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building approvals in locations with high risk of fire are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal on the reform of the forest, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was rejected by the local authorities who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a slackening of the law, which allowed construction activity to fall if the applicant had means of self-defence - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," continues João Sorval in the same article in the newspaper Público. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus trees, trees of easily combustible wood, like in a vicious circle, continued to spread after fires of this kind."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"in addition to these problems, the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15th and 16th, when inhabitants searched for information or tried to contact relatives, was offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the people with information: they took advantage of their own civil protection data using fove.pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and, on this fateful weekend in October, was so decisive that the servers did not withstand the onslaught of 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf was found again in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a couple of years he worked in a coal mine.</seg>
<seg id="2889">"then he took what was left of his low wages, and went to Iran. once more, he was in a foreign country along with other refugees and towed sacks with mortars that were heavier than himself to make a living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by misery and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," Asharaf recalls in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site where we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows to avoid freezing at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready for travel to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"when crossing the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his application for asylum, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time, Asharaf was homeless, running through the streets of Rome, sleeping in parks and went to a church that distributed food to aid patients twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">It is true that Italy is a second chance for rejected asylum seekers as a result of relatively high twin quotas. it is also true that the conditions which find asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic.</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Human Rights Organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "special reception centres" "which are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unqualified personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum, which after registering the asylum application can still go for months."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who do not have money for accommodation are either dependent on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his irrepressible life-willingness helped Asharaf to soon release himself out of these conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf put his total savings into the establishment of a hostels in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast bar.</seg>

<seg id="2913">"according to the official estimates, about 20,000 Afghans live in Italy."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years, a number of Afghan companies have emerged, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
<seg id="2917">"in Venice, Hamed Ahmadi had the idea to his restaurant Orient Experience where the waiters and the kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world."</seg>

<seg id="2921">"where a risk is, there are also possibilities," says Asharaf with a smile. "I want to invest in Afghanistan."</seg>
<seg id="2922">I have never forgotten my country and I can't live happily if I know my people are suffering.</seg>
