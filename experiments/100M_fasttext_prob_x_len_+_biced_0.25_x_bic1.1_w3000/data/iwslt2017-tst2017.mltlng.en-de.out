this is James Ris@@ en .
&quot; you might know him , because as a New York Times re@@ porter , he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize . &quot;
&quot; long before someone heard Edward Snow@@ den , Ris@@ en wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the N@@ SA illeg@@ ally owned tel@@ eph@@ ones by Americans . &quot;
but there is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA handed over Iran literally blu@@ epr@@ ints for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it &apos;s an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined Ris@@ en and called upon him to name its alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this turn , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and whis@@ per@@ ing journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Constitutional Court , the media have the right to publish secret information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the people they reveal . &quot;
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked on Ris@@ en , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters already did before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , ris@@ ons lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although they had years indication that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to Ris@@ en . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance the re@@ porters and sources can always hide less .
&quot; instead of reti@@ ring and ris@@ king statements , this could also do its digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly concerned their phone calls , &quot;
&quot; just like his e @-@ mail data , finance and bank information , his credit , and even travel tips with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence to condemn Jeff@@ rey Ray , a CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ en source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower going to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work onto the game , which is to be protected by the first constitutional warrant , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as technology allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do this from the moment they contact , rather than in retro@@ sp@@ ect , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which didn &apos;t exist , as Ris@@ en wrote his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Secure@@ Drop , an open source trans@@ mitt@@ ance system for whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , in which I have been working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news site like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , just like any usual contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant news agency has access .
&quot; so the government can no longer proc@@ ure information secretly , and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
&quot; Secure@@ Drop , however , is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new es@@ pion@@ age technologies that end@@ anger all of us . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snow@@ den have a chance to bring mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , &quot;
or the next environmental contribut@@ or who strikes alarm for the poll@@ uted water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall Street insi@@ der who warned us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes , but to protect all of our constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data leak of the story was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Pap@@ ers &quot; reveal that rich and powerful &#93; &#91; enormous sums &#93; hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens . &#93; &#91; What does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to firms like Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say , &quot; Ok@@ ay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see emails , the sharing of messages , how the whole system works , as it works . &quot;
this has already led to very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has let@@ ter@@ box companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , a close friend from children &apos;s days , a famous Cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of ri@@ cher people out there and others waiting for the next release , and on the next exposed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham novel .
&quot; it seems like crying out from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should we do that ?
&quot; but the truth is : when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that affects all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; throughout the world , media and leading politicians , like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , are used by some few to hide and mask their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people are very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ r@@ yo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so one has a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters . &quot;
I think it &apos;s also interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter .
&quot; probably because up to now there were no prominent Americans , who came to this scandal in these revelations . &quot;
now it &apos;s not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but because of the principle behind which these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples showing connections to the US . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some U.S. states , less information is required to provide less information to form a company than to obtain a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the USA allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
it has allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off especially vulnerable off@@ springs .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here with Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a cover@@ t investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 attor@@ neys in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator was an African minister , who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the U.S. to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
it really shocked us that all our investig@@ ators were making suggestions as to how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course no one was given money . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as individual cases .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our cover@@ t investig@@ ators .
&quot; it &apos;s not about a single peak politi@@ cian , involved in a scandal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to handle this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
&quot; this may sound very ridi@@ cul@@ ously as if we could not do anything about it , as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I can see that some things have started to change . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , we have seen violations of transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU registers in central registers at national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the USA lag behind here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have inserted a bill in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how this Panama disclosure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally . &quot;
for us with Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
&quot; we need ordinary people who become angry , when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bog@@ us firms . &quot;
we need leaders in the economy to get up and say : &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business .
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency .
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which is now enabling this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a res@@ ale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my things .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the Peace Corps .
I invited him on a beer . he told me enthusi@@ astically how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him , &quot; &quot; Where are you sleeping tonight ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing worse : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what am I gon@@ na do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; he says that he would go to the Peace Corps , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans . I don &apos;t want to land kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ da ! &quot;
this is a small boot !
then I heard myself saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said : &quot; &quot; u@@ h , as please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I was lying in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I burn ? &quot;
a wild stranger is sleeping in my living room .
what if he is crazy ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , sh@@ ear@@ ed on to@@ e tips to the door , and shut down my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
&quot; the artwork , which he bought from me , hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher . &quot;
that was my first experience as a host . it changed my perspective completely .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; we make a leap of time , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate draws out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
I think creativity can create fear into fun .
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could make something about it . our apartment became a designer bed and breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and created so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at the air mattress on wooden floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress .
they thought it was great and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; we tou@@ red with them throughout the city . when we passed our last guest and kno@@ cked the door into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that at the same time we could find new friends and pay our rent ?
things came rolling .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; so we presented to investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people share publicly images of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors you close when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite foreign people to stay with them . &quot;
this will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we were waiting for the missi@@ le to ign@@ ite .
but they are not .
&quot; nobody , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that foreigners are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you should focus on the things you can do well . we were able to design . &quot;
&quot; at the Academy of Fine Arts , we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience . &quot;
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we strive for .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hands .
now I &apos;d like to unlock your mobile phone .
please enter your locked cell phone to your left sitting room@@ mate .
this quiet touch of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked mobile phone of a stranger ?
most sense the responsibility .
most of the guests feel so comfortable when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just so , who actually has Al Gor@@ es mobile phone ? &quot;
could you announce on Twitter that he is running for the president &apos;s office ?
you can return the cell phones now .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail of this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name , if he had told wh@@ ence he came from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you &apos;d have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really handle very well sprung mobile phones !
how would you feel when you had to hand over your mobile phone ?
because a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust decisi@@ vely .
&quot; in the beginning , we did some things wrong . &quot;
it was hard for people to give negative assessments .
&quot; ultimately , we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their ratings before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they relate to age and place of residence .
&quot; little surprisingly , we trust people most that are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting to add a person &apos;s call -- in our case by app@@ rais@@ als .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation mel@@ ts simil@@ arities .
the right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you talk too little , like &quot; Hi ! , &quot; you get no answer . &quot;
&quot; you tell too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; great works of art in your home ! I make holidays with my family . &quot;
how can you create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we didn &apos;t expect was the huge amount of people who were more than willing to cast off those prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team .
third : a demand that had not been covered before .
&quot; for us , the business runs very well . &quot;
of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly .
there were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when trust was broken .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts even if I only think about it .
the disappointment that you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
&quot; fortunately , overnight stays of 123 million had only a fraction of a problem . &quot;
for people are rightly familiar with each other .
&quot; if trust works , wonderful things can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; Ja@@ vier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels who save one &apos;s life , even though they don &apos;t know one . &quot;
&quot; you drive one in your own car to the hospital , if you die , and wait while you get a b@@ ypass . &quot;
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without charge the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; so , of course , not every stay is off . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled upon this notion , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the thought of sharing coinci@@ de with monetary transactions ?
it &apos;s about economic trade .
&quot; but to call it &quot; rental industry , &quot; the matter is not justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people open a part of themselves , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when you travel nowadays , you can compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
&quot; what if travelling , however , would be a rich buffet of local impressions ? &quot;
&quot; what if in any place you visit , a group of residents would wait for a thorough brief@@ ing and show you a neighbourhood where you have never heard of ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we were to create apartments from scratch ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of sharing one part ?
&quot; I imagine cities that enable society and relationships , rather than lon@@ el@@ iness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot;
&quot; students who were looking for a place to stay , &quot;
were given to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ator programs were started .
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the share economy . over our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a foreign or even host in 191 countries . &quot;
so the idea seems to be not as crazy as we were taught .
we didn &apos;t re@@ invent the wheel .
there was also hospitality in advance .
there were similar sites before us .
so why has our work just worked ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
I think it &apos;s amazing
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da passes by me .
&quot; we know , of course , that design cannot solve every problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us if it had this great influence , I wonder what we can use in the near future . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think if you look at me ?
a beli@@ ever ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the airport &apos;s security check .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t blame you for your negative impressions .
that &apos;s how the media portra@@ y people who look like me .
one study found that 80 % of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans mean most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk about their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for all those who have never met a Muslim , it is great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a fitness @-@ fitness @-@ fan@@ atic , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born in that way . &quot;
I decided to do this .
&quot; when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ te . &quot;
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear the Hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a declaration of independence for me , as opposed to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only pas@@ sively accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Koran .
&quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ting and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
&quot; it was trust and slow devotion , which deep@@ ened each reading of the Koran . &quot;
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that somebody perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and began , like all good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came the terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , aircraft flew into buildings , people jumped from the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical fault ?
my shock quickly turned into ou@@ trage .
why should I do something like that ?
&quot; I changed the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; , &quot; ... in the name of Islam ... , &quot; ... &quot; Middle Eastern descent ... &quot; , &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... &quot; ... &quot; bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it is not only my country that has been attacked , but in the N@@ u , the actions of others have transformed me from a citizen into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start building up studies . &quot;
&quot; I remember , as we ro@@ de -- as we ro@@ de in silence -- so deep it went down into my seat , and I first feared to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; then I heard , saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t move in well lit areas . &quot; &quot;
I stayed in@@ doors all the week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gathered for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings were : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mos@@ que might be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims , dra@@ gged into the open and struck . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I &apos;ve got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can indeed hear people say , &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mus@@ k .
they speak of my church like a tumor in the US body .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumour is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are po@@ int@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumor in the US body , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first resp@@ onder@@ s and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make safer ?
&quot; it may stop some parking spaces , but do not stop terror . &quot;
the regular visit of a mos@@ que leads to more tolerant of people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and like me , a leader of the police in the Washington area , DC recently told : people are actually not radi@@ cal@@ ised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are ra@@ dic@@ alized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; when first , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family so that the extre@@ mis@@ m group may have a bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or belief . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent ra@@ dic@@ alization , we must stop the people to go to the mos@@ que . &quot;
some people still argue that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS creates its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human , I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam like the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but when you take a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding Ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she preten@@ ded to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said the problem was exactly the opposite . every cl@@ erg@@ y@@ man with whom she spoke , sil@@ enced her and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that makes sense to its anger , it was a major goal for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts , who promised a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and its church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using them of their anger , he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mos@@ que , she protected from joining the IS . &quot;
this was an insight as to how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but what about ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , to our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we accept rather an author@@ itarian governance , conformity , and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; one study shows that if people present messages in which negative reports were reported on Muslims , they were more likely to attack Muslim countries as well as the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood rises against Muslims , between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
it can indeed be a tool for manipul@@ ating the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens .
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear hur@@ ts us all . &quot;
&quot; when it comes to the assignment of collective guilt , it is not just about having to explain yourself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was an athlete .
&quot; he was talented at the dental clinic , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said :
&quot; &quot; &quot; when has I become such a young man from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after Su@@ z@@ anne &apos;s visit to her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , killed her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . &quot;
he fired up to De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after the 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mos@@ que or were we staying safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about which America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can freely exercise our religion . &quot;
we chose the mos@@ que .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat , we ro@@ de in silence , with high pressure to the mos@@ que . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , pulled out my shoes , went to the prayer hall , and what I saw let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , for half of the assembly was Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who had come not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I collap@@ sed . &quot;
these people were there because they had pan@@ i@@ cked and prejudi@@ ced pan@@ gs and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you pick at the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you very much .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : well , D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what do you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , are a thin@@ ker with a drau@@ ght , working in a clas@@ sy think factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t fool you . I &apos;m completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I &apos;m as usual as allowed .
&quot; looking at Muslims around the world , and I did this with the largest ever conducted study of Muslims around the world , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am in no way an exception .
&quot; when people appear as an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billion dollar business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air package launch into our social awareness , an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Fra@@ c Centre in France built a six @-@ meter high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the audience . &quot;
&quot; by connecting , flying devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space . &quot;
you can also build up @-@ to @-@ yourself tension @-@ resistant structures .
&quot; they have learned to bear burdens , to deal with turbul@@ ence and to react in general to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zürich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratories . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each aircraft has internal sensors to determine position in space and determine what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands are available on the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear @-@ starter , &quot;
a flight device that tries to hit two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters it can float , and has great advantages in launching and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a restriction of stern star@@ ters is that they are sensitive to turbul@@ ence such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
&quot; the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn &apos;t matter in which position , the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practi@@ sing . &quot;
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
such a question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts to get together to hurt you .
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly away controlled aircraft that had only two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
we recently discovered that flying with just one works .
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross @-@ sections , no further actu@@ ation drives or controller surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , a lot happens inside the inner life so that it can fly soli@@ dly and move anywhere in the room . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the h@@ edge @-@ star@@ ters . to get it to fly , I must throw it exactly right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of just throwing it right when everyone is watching is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in vi@@ gil@@ ance , this machine is here , the Omni@@ cop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that he is only symmet@@ rical .
that is why it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment .
&quot; thus , it receives the most extraordinary ability , &quot;
&quot; move in the room in all directions , no matter what direction he is shot or even how it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some things are possible in models , the rest is learned directly while flying . &quot;
let &apos;s take a look at that .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two @-@ prop@@ eller flight machines .
this turns clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when one builds them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; but if something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller dies off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly , albeit constra@@ ined . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by fli@@ pping a half fli@@ ght@@ less .
the last demonstration examines synthetic s@@ war@@ ms .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercially available Micro @-@ Quad@@ cop@@ ters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equi@@ p it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in the room it is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations will motiv@@ ate you to imagine new revolutionary ideas .
the particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway .
of course it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology .
for types like us wages are in development and act of creation .
&quot; it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you very much .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago two black holes were cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very distant gal@@ axy , so the mass of three suns turned into pure energy in a tenth of a second . &quot;
this short moment they lit more bri@@ ghtly than all the stars along in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire known universe .
it was a very big b@@ ang .
&quot; their energy , however , did not set them free in the form of light -- &quot;
finally we speak of black holes .
the entire energy was released into space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; first , we arrange the events time . &quot;
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , several zel@@ liges ago was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then the Earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , people and -- God is standing on us -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of especially courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of the Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , which arise approximately by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most thought they were crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses , so the US National Science Foundation financed its idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves @-@ observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the following years , the precision of Lig@@ o could be significantly increased , which greatly improved detection performance . &quot;
therefore it is called Advanced Lig@@ o .
&quot; in early September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a final test run to solve some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the detector was commissioned , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ro@@ amed through the earth through the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
&quot; in essence , they were the fruits of my life . &quot;
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and her by observ@@ atories like lig@@ o measurable signals for 23 years . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cri@@ mp@@ ing in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when passing the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative purposes , teachers in the theory of rel@@ ativity play a really sil@@ ly dance . &quot;
&quot; stretch and st@@ ow , stretch and st@@ ow . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on the 14th of September , for example , each one of us was stretched and st@@ owed when the waves hit . an average man stretch was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is 20 zer@@ os after comm@@ a , followed by one . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometer laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured on less than one thous@@ and@@ th of a nucleus of an atomic nucleus . this is grot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classic text about gra@@ vit@@ ation
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I want to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perc@@ ei@@ ving the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
&quot; with sounds , that is different . &quot;
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
for example your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , Alice is talking . &quot;
&quot; and Bob is interrup@@ ting her . &quot;
&quot; sil@@ ly Bob , &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gravity , we can tell about a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , simply chir@@ ping : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; the two bodies rotate very quickly , you hear the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . it sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed into the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s Sound &#93; Som@@ ebody knows what to hear , sees this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 times solar mass , which turn about as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s consider what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , circles around one hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know about it because we have heard it .
this is the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to resear@@ ching the universe as it has never been possible before .
&quot; on this way , we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible . &quot;
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practically or basically -- not .
&quot; a super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super@@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes , however , occur at the core that lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through as these are opa@@ que .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate ir@@ ons as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them as the Big B@@ ang is covered by his own after@@ glow . &quot;
&quot; with the help of gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in All things we have never seen , which we will never see , and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first trial we didn &apos;t expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this topic : me : the kind of stars that black holes bring forth , like Lig@@ o they observed , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies from prehistoric times . the black holes are the sau@@ sage bones for our archaeological work so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the Big B@@ ang himself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for a year I would say to all , &quot; &quot; Yes ! &quot; &quot; I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into uncomfortable situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : to do exactly what I was afraid of , eliminated my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear of keeping speeches , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , gone . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
&quot; but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply , to an unexpected . it began with a question of my little ones . &quot;
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my be@@ ak cup . &quot;
she asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said : &quot; yes .
this yes was the beginning
&quot; no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently did I fully understand that the &quot; yes &quot; say to playing with my children saved my career .
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am the author . I think of things , wake up to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I create television . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in a great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are in production at the same time . &quot;
every program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode , every nine days , four shows , ie all nine days 20 million dollars TV , four television programs , 70 hours of TV , three broad@@ casts that simultaneously are in production four times four , 16 episodes simultaneously : 24 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
$ 350 million for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series run succ@@ essively on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I created myself , and not just produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , bon@@ fires that burn around the world . &quot;
do you know who does that ?
&quot; no one , that &apos;s why I &apos;m a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work so hard , whether you lead a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously if I speak of work so that you understand that I am not just hanging around on the computer and f@@ anci@@ er , and it is true when I say : I don &apos;t understand that it is not about dreams during a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m immersed in my work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is as if I set up troops when I painted on a canvas .
&quot; as a lu@@ ci@@ d sound , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love working .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . and the best part is the bu@@ zz . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work is going well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy street , I could go for it forever . &quot;
&quot; many people assume , when I explain to them the sums that I &apos;m talking about writing that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t get me wrong , it does . &quot;
&quot; but the h@@ um -- when I began to work and work and make , build , create and collaborate , I discovered this thing , this h@@ um , this energy . the bu@@ zz ! &quot;
the hum@@ ming is more than writing .
the hum@@ ming is action and activity . the bu@@ zz is a drug .
the hum@@ ming is music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a h@@ um , then you can &apos;t strive to be different from size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of not being different than striving for great@@ ness , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called Sum@@ ma .
or perhaps it also means being a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
perhaps it is genius .
perhaps it is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I am not made for failure , and I only know that I love the sums . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I &apos;m a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I will , the more broad@@ casts , the more work there are , the more things at the same time , the more I write history , the more I write history . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
I love work isn &apos;t it ?
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz@@ ing , the bu@@ zz@@ ing . &quot;
I like this h@@ um . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the h@@ um . I am the h@@ um .
am I just this h@@ um ?
and then the bu@@ zz stopped .
&quot; revised , over@@ loaded , exagger@@ ated , burned out . &quot;
the hum@@ ming stopped .
now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her m@@ um@@ my is a single stit@@ ch .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says , &quot; &quot; A@@ gain , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da land . &quot; &quot; &quot;
these are the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are Baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the hum@@ ming ceased . &quot;
the hum@@ ming of the engine sil@@ enced .
I didn &apos;t love my work anymore .
the h@@ um did not come back .
my bu@@ zz was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no regre@@ ts , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no h@@ um .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ show titanium , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I simply had no more fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the h@@ um and the hum@@ ming was me .
&quot; so what do you do if what you do , the work you love , suddenly fa@@ des ? &quot;
&quot; I know , some may think , &quot; Look out , stupid author Titan . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but you know you do , you do , you do , you do , you love what you do , be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love someone else and that gives you the bu@@ zz when you know the bu@@ zz when the bu@@ zz stops , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late and she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I want to say no when two things become clear to me :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to everything and secondly , she didn &apos;t call me &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot; &quot; &quot;
she doesn &apos;t call anyone &quot; kit@@ ten . &quot;
when did this happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m titanium and my hum@@ ming smo@@ kes , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about that .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in the lon@@ el@@ iness and absence of the h@@ um , I can do nothing but watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky fingers and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wa@@ xing pins and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl releases in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of work .
and I am happy .
something in me sol@@ ves .
a mental door enters and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that doesn &apos;t happen immediately , but it happens it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming slowly comes back .
&quot; no full volume , barely there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the hum@@ ming , but a bu@@ zz . &quot;
and now I feel as if I know a magical secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . just love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the working sum , the titanium h@@ um , that is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am when I complain about broad@@ casts and TV hours and how functional my brain is , then I forgot what the real bu@@ zz is . &quot;
the sum is not a force and it is not labor @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
real bu@@ zz is dependent on love .
the hum@@ ming is the current that comes from the lust for life .
real bu@@ zz is self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums are ignor@@ ing the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real bu@@ zz is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from any guilt as a work@@ ah@@ o@@ lic .
&quot; it &apos;s law , I have no choice . I have no choice , if I want to hear the h@@ um again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so easy . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not up to me as much as working .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer to be at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what kind of person would prefer to be than to be a home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan &quot; -- &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we hur@@ ried around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we are bur@@ sting soap bubbles .
&quot; I mainly feel stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always use my mobile phone .
but it &apos;s ok .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
&quot; you can also do it ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot;
maybe you hold me na@@ ï@@ ve for a day@@ dre@@ amer .
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something different . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; after 15 minutes , a lad@@ y@@ bird or cookie replaces me . &quot;
&quot; and when my teen @-@ daughter talks to me for a whole period of 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , more does not need it . &quot;
&quot; everyone can get 15 minutes a bit , even on a bad day ! &quot;
15 minutes a day !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray . &quot;
but 15 minutes are inside !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , have a place for peace of mind . &quot;
it is not about playing with your own children .
to play &quot; games &quot; in general .
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what is good for you .
find out and preserve it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will fail and I won . meet friends , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I got a titanium in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on a piece why don &apos;t you treat yourself to 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about that ? nothing !
the hum@@ ming came back in my spare time . the hum@@ ming then seems to return if I don &apos;t work .
working doesn &apos;t work without games .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the h@@ um , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the h@@ um , the hum@@ ming is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky finger , dinner with friends . &quot;
that is my sum@@ ming now .
the bu@@ zz of life .
the tot@@ ality of love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just a part of it . and I am so grateful for that . &quot;
it is a pleasure to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan playing a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still working . my bon@@ fires are still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel like a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the clearer is my head . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the bu@@ zz . the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the other , the real bu@@ zz : the bu@@ zz of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new attitude of life in me is wide . less titanium -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a writer . I think of things , I &apos;m contempl@@ ating you to life . &quot;
&quot; this belongs to the job , which means to live his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human trage@@ dies .
I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident .
&quot; for us neuro@@ surgeon it is very fru@@ str@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became a functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by different surgical procedures .
&quot; they have probably heard of one of the best known , the &quot; &quot; deep brain stimulation &quot; . &quot; in the process , one im@@ planted a electro@@ de in the brain in order to influence the neur@@ ons &apos; circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it is really an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson &apos;s who suffered severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; neuro@@ mod@@ ulation , however , does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is to restore the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
history began 15 years ago .
at that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
&quot; often , I provided patients with a skull @-@ brain trauma . &quot;
they have to imagine that the brain sw@@ ells in the brain and the cran@@ ial pressure increases .
&quot; in order to save life , you have to reduce cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
for this you sometimes have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity and the environment to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François succeeded . &quot;
he saw that under his micro@@ scope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly the same as a stem cell culture . with large green cells that are surrounded by small , un@@ mature cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are im@@ mature cells , which can transform into every cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly .
&quot; they never die , they are im@@ mortal . &quot;
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they slowly shared and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population that looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
&quot; in the fet@@ us stage , they cause the brain to fold . &quot;
but why are they retained ?
we don &apos;t know that .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
&quot; however , this is not so safe . &quot;
&quot; one thing , however , is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
&quot; we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area , and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did . &quot;
and they are then colored in color to be able to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we reim@@ port them at the taking place of the same individual . &quot;
we call aut@@ olog@@ ous transplantation - Aut@@ otran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens if we re @-@ implant these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen if we re @-@ implant the same cells into damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with apes .
&quot; in the first scenario we reim@@ plant@@ able the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added an injury to and reim@@ plant@@ ation exactly the same cells and now the cells remained .
here you can see what we could observe under the micro@@ scope .
these are the cells that have been reim@@ planted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells that we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; here , of course , we couldn &apos;t stop . &quot;
does these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained monkeys with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from one tablet .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable level of skill , we had the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they couldn &apos;t move their hand any more . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they recovered spontaneously to a certain degree , just as after a stroke . &quot;
patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree as well as the monkeys .
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left , they see the monkey , who picked up spontaneously . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from before the injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; now , when we reim@@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after expl@@ ant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you these were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to implant it in humans .
I really hope that I can soon show you how the human brain is giving us the means to heal itself .
thank you very much .
&quot; Luigi Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , this is wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , so on . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will the authority allow us to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi@@ center study . &quot;
first you have to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a great mistake to consider them as self @-@ evident .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at it as imm@@ utable entity .
we believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy .
that is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thri@@ ving capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy is wan@@ ing with us , in Europe . &quot;
at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistak@@ ably clari@@ fied to me as Minister of Finance in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs realized in Greece .
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my so@@ ber friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe again that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group are mistaken , we could save the democracy , but that we need a genuine and def@@ en@@ cel@@ ess democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy our societies are m@@ um@@ bling , our future ble@@ ak and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point to an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; twin peak Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which casts its long shadow over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy as@@ par@@ ag@@ us and corporations , but are too anxious to invest where it would be productive and bring revenues to produce the debt burden and even produce all the things humanity urgently needs , such as &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , $ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion has been invested in the United States , England and the euro@@ zone , invested in all the prosperity producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so on . &quot;
&quot; 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until one compar@@ es it to the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing , except to infl@@ ate the stock markets and boost real estate prices . &quot;
&quot; thus debts and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks , which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old in the United States , Japan and Europe job@@ less , and consequently a low overall economic demand , which , like in an endless loop , advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , who would be true that his son would kill him if he grows up , &quot;
un@@ intentionally bring about the circumstances causing the body to kill it .
this is my Ha@@ der with Cap@@ ital@@ ism --
&quot; all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , to develop human talents and especially finance all of the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
but before we continue : what do we mean by democracy ?
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; of course , ath@@ en@@ ical democracy included too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to mi@@ tig@@ ate the importance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive thing about Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that she with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with equal voice wei@@ ghting in matters of state affairs . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the ath@@ en@@ ian democracy has not held long . &quot;
&quot; like a candle , which shines bri@@ ghtly , it is burnt out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies don &apos;t have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American Constitution . &quot;
&quot; while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a by@@ word for rulers . &quot;
&quot; liberal democracy first arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , there was a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two , as the economy gradually under@@ mines politics and dis@@ fi@@ gured it . &quot;
wondering why politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not due to a degeneration of its DNA .
&quot; it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government , and still not in power , because the power of politics has emig@@ rated to the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my hatred with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es that so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which it feeds on , that they end up star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are being de@@ valued , inequality increases , the macro@@ economic demand falls , and the managers of the corporations are too frigh@@ tened to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to re@@ assemble politics and economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; retains the control , just as in ancient Athens , except for the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good .
&quot; the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens , without creating new ways of brut@@ ality and waste . &quot;
but there is a solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin peaks higher , the waste of sub@@ lime , and social conflicts deeper , as it is -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we must re@@ organize the economy and re@@ unite the fields of economy and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a dise@@ ased surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy which makes the movie &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is super@@ se@@ ded by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia , similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; in which machines are used to human beings , or into a high @-@ tech version of ancient Athens &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; indul@@ ging in long conversations with the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we must be optimistic .
&quot; so what would it take , how could it look like having this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you a few examples . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies : please imagine a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to another , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter which one is working -- is the property of those currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all revenues from capital and income come from , and the concept of wage labor is completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
&quot; no distinction is made between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it , and employees who work there , but who do not belong to them . no more exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin peaks . &quot;
&quot; in the realm of global political economy , please imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interests of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the cosmos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in green technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds ra@@ r . &quot;
that is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference of 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have it , especially against the background of a re@@ unified policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe is at the same time a liberal in which it prefers privileged persons , and Marxist , because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the bin of history , and Key@@ n@@ esian , global Key@@ n@@ esian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy .
will we wake up in such a world ?
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Giussani , Yan@@ is ... &quot;
you write yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers describes as &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will dest@@ abil@@ ise only our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , then Marx is absolutely relevant . &quot;
&quot; just like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that &apos;s why I am a Liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and therefore I am completely confused . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually , it was Einstein who said this . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of a democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most plays out -- the area of economics -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I can say this so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is today like the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; because -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically regarded . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about democratic development .
&quot; what can be observed now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
now to acc@@ use China of doing what the West has done in the 19th century smells like hypo@@ cris@@ y .
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as Greek Finance Minister at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I knew that would come .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later for the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ appo@@ inting because we had the opportunity to start a new start with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; to say good @-@ bye to us from the self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continuous denial that a massive fault line went through the euro@@ zone , and continues to threaten the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European Group , have continued to deny denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
that is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if one tries an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and author@@ it@@ ari@@ anism , one might delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destro@@ ys . &quot;
BG : what changes do you anticipate ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its structure . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
&quot; if there is a minister of finance or any minister who , after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , asser@@ ts that he has made no mistake , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the renewal of the debt program at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but that was not the case .
they merely wanted to drop our government because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that went through the euro@@ zone .
they did not want to admit that they had been conducting a disa@@ strous program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the Great Depression .
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , said : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of the talks , you seem to be pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone is coming from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; my biggest fear is that the euro@@ zone does not survive . &quot;
&quot; for if they do not survive , the liberated centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not be disa@@ strous for Europe alone , but for the whole world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930 , according to which it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you very much for being at TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard most of them , although he is probably responsible for 22 mid @-@ minutes of your life on April 19 , 2013 . &quot;
&quot; probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes , but not for very many of you . &quot;
that goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago .
&quot; Roy Price is an employee at Amazon Studios , &quot;
the Amazon TV production company .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ eats and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any .
&quot; he must find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the assessment distribution of more than 2,500 TV series on the website IM@@ DB . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows this assessment is received . &quot;
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Bre@@ aking Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive to where , after you have watched a squ@@ ad@@ ron , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think you need special intelligence to enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the mean deportation , average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t inspire . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time that Amazon does something like that , so Roy Price wants to risk nothing . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and , through an evaluation , sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where everyone can watch them for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon doesn &apos;t get things out for nothing , it &apos;s up to you to do it right ? &quot;
millions of spectators are watching these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you can record when you start the show , when you pause , which parts are ski@@ pped or looked again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and hence the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four Repub@@ lican US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House ended at 7.5 -- therefore something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for Net@@ fli@@ x program design . &quot;
&quot; instead of staging a contest , he and his team looked at the available data about the Net@@ fli@@ x audience , so the ratings they give to the shows their course shows which shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out about the audience these little details : which shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve .
&quot; of course , the question is : what has happened here ? &quot;
&quot; there are two very competitive , data @-@ sav@@ vy companies . &quot;
they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company .
what is this ?
because logic somehow says that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good television , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work , this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
does anybody know the company Multi @-@ Health Systems ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in prison in the United States and asks for dis@@ miss@@ al , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dis@@ miss@@ al is carried out or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always producing the best results . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of the most experienced companies are incorrect .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict break@@ through@@ s of influenza , the wicked way -- through data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked out wonderfully and was a great news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked flaw@@ lessly , year around year by year , until suddenly it didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and nobody could say why .
&quot; it simply didn &apos;t work , this was again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these errors , data stream into decisions of life -- at work , in law enforcement , in medicine . &quot;
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics - an area where some very clever people uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably use a lot of data to make serious decisions , such as the decision for a cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a drug . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyse the individual parts ; as a branch , you put the individual parts together again to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help break down a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to re@@ assemble the parts and then come to a decision .
there is another tool for this and we all possess it : our brain .
&quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , it is to re@@ assemble parts and pieces even if the information is incomplete , in order to gain a good conclusion -- especially if it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; therefore , I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and intelligence where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , what they otherwise wouldn &apos;t have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards &quot; does not stand in the data . &quot;
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a big personal risk with this decision .
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all of their choices first when they were competing for TV ideas , then they chose &quot; &quot; Alpha House &quot; &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a secure decision because they could always say : &quot; this is what the data tells us .
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget this , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a hunting or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will challenge it later with a technical demonstration .
so far I have made some decisions in my life and I should have listened to the ball in hin@@ d@@ sight .
&quot; but , as you naturally know , if you have the data available , you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data , it is still worth taking decisions to make decisions , to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; because in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
