<seg id="1">This is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">"you might know him, because as a New York Times reporter, he won the Pulitzer Prize."</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone heard Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacular that the NSA illegally owned telephones by Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But there is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA handed over Iran literally blueprints for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It's an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined Risen and called upon him to name its alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this turn, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblowers and whispering journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Constitutional Court, the media have the right to publish secret information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right when media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the people they reveal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked on Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters already did before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, risons lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although they had years indication that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of retiring and risking statements, this could also do its digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, secretly concerned their phone calls,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his e-mail data, finance and bank information, his credit, and even travel tips with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence to condemn Jeffrey Ray, a CIA Whistleblower and Risen source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all US governments in front of him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower going to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work onto the game, which is to be protected by the first constitutional warrant, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as technology allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do this from the moment they contact, rather than in retrospect, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which didn't exist, as Risen wrote his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmittance system for whistleblower, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is now developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, in which I have been working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news site like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, just like any usual contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the relevant news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer procure information secretly, and many of the information it would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">"SecureDrop, however, is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century."</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new espionage technologies that endanger all of us."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technology leaders such as Edward Snowden have a chance to bring misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistleblower,"</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental contributor who strikes alarm for the polluted water of Flint. or a Wall Street insider who warned us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to uncover crimes, but to protect all of our constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest data leak of the story was published.] [the "Panama Papers" reveal that rich and powerful] [enormous sums] hidden in tax havens.] [What does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a glimpse into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to firms like Mossack Fonseca and say," Okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see emails, the sharing of messages, how the whole system works, as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has letterbox companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is alleged that a track of 2 billion US dollars leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, a close friend from children's days, a famous Cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of richer people out there and others waiting for the next release, and on the next exposed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems like crying out from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should we do that?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: when the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"throughout the world, media and leading politicians, like secret tax havens, are used by some few to hide and mask their assets -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people are very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so one has a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society really to understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it's also interesting that there are fewer reports in the US about this matter.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably because up to now there were no prominent Americans, who came to this scandal in these revelations."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it's not that there are no rich Americans hiding their assets in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but because of the principle behind which these tax havens work, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a leak from the Cayman Islands or even Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples showing connections to the US."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, in some U.S. states, less information is required to provide less information to form a company than to obtain a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the USA allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">It has allowed scammers to rip off especially vulnerable offsprings.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here with Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a covert investigator to the offices of 13 attorneys in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator was an African minister, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the U.S. to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">It really shocked us that all our investigators were making suggestions as to how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course no one was given money. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as individual cases.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our covert investigators.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it's not about a single peak politician, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to handle this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We have to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very ridiculously as if we could not do anything about it, as if nothing had ever changed; as if there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I can see that some things have started to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the past few years, we have seen violations of transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme found political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron at the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU registers in central registers at national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the USA lag behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have inserted a bill in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how this Panama disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the United States and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us with Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">"we need ordinary people who become angry, when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind bogus firms."</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy to get up and say: "intransparency is not good for business.</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the intransparency, which is now enabling this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a resale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my things.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a road trip across the country. afterwards he would go to the Peace Corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him on a beer. he told me enthusiastically how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him," "Where are you sleeping tonight?" ""</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing worse:" "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What am I gonna do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"he says that he would go to the Peace Corps, but I don't know if he really plans. I don't want to land kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazda!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small boot!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said:" "uh, as please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I was lying in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what did I burn?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger is sleeping in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is crazy?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, sheared on toe tips to the door, and shut down my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">"the artwork, which he bought from me, hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher."</seg>
<seg id="120">That was my first experience as a host. it changed my perspective completely.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who were waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"we make a leap of time, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I'm unemployed, almost broke, my roommate draws out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">I think creativity can create fear into fun.</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could make something about it. our apartment became a designer bed and breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and created so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep at the air mattress on wooden floors for 20 dollars on the air mattress.</seg>
<seg id="131">They thought it was great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese ham omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"we toured with them throughout the city. when we passed our last guest and knocked the door into the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that at the same time we could find new friends and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"so we presented to investors:" we want to create a website where people share publicly images of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors you close when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite foreign people to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">This will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We were waiting for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they are not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that foreigners are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you should focus on the things you can do well. we were able to design."</seg>
<seg id="147">"at the Academy of Fine Arts, we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience."</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense trust through design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a taste of what degree of confidence we strive for.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hands.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I'd like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Please enter your locked cell phone to your left sitting roommate.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet touch of panic you now feel -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked mobile phone of a stranger?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">Most of the guests feel so comfortable when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just so, who actually has Al Gores mobile phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you announce on Twitter that he is running for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can return the cell phones now.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail of this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbour had first presented himself with his name, if he had told whence he came from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you'd have 150 judgements that all say: "he can really handle very well sprung mobile phones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel when you had to hand over your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust decisively.</seg>
<seg id="173">"in the beginning, we did some things wrong."</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative assessments.</seg>
<seg id="175">"ultimately, we decided to wait until both hosts and guests had given their ratings before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how similar they relate to age and place of residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">"little surprisingly, we trust people most that are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting to add a person's call -- in our case by appraisals.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation melts similarities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us to overcome some of our deeply rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you talk too little, like" Hi!, "you get no answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"you tell too much, for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "great works of art in your home! I make holidays with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How can you create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the right amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we didn't expect was the huge amount of people who were more than willing to cast off those prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the tireless work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a demand that had not been covered before.</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business runs very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">Of course there are times when not everything goes smoothly.</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who have not allowed parties to celebrate or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked on the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when trust was broken.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts even if I only think about it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that you hear in the voice of the caller was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, overnight stays of 123 million had only a fraction of a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people are rightly familiar with each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"if trust works, wonderful things can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who tend to heart attacks due to sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels who save one's life, even though they don't know one."</seg>
<seg id="218">"you drive one in your own car to the hospital, if you die, and wait while you get a bypass."</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they pass books."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without charge the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"so, of course, not every stay is off."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the share economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first stumbled upon this notion, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the thought of sharing coincide with monetary transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It's about economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but to call it" rental industry, "the matter is not justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people open a part of themselves, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel nowadays, you can compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">"what if travelling, however, would be a rich buffet of local impressions?"</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you visit, a group of residents would wait for a thorough briefing and show you a neighbourhood where you have never heard of;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we were to create apartments from scratch?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of sharing one part?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that enable society and relationships, rather than loneliness and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in South Korea's capital Seoul, this project has already begun."</seg>
<seg id="240">"students who were looking for a place to stay,"</seg>
<seg id="241">Were given to people whose children were moved out. incubator programs were started.</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the share economy. over our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a foreign or even host in 191 countries."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea seems to be not as crazy as we were taught.</seg>
<seg id="244">We didn't reinvent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">There was also hospitality in advance.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar sites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why has our work just worked?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">I think it's amazing</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda passes by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"we know, of course, that design cannot solve every problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us if it had this great influence, I wonder what we can use in the near future."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think if you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the airport's security check.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't blame you for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">That's how the media portray people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">One study found that 80% of the coverage of Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans mean most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk about their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for all those who have never met a Muslim, it is great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I'm introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a fitness-fitness-fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born in that way."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do this.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17, I decided to oute."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear the Hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified:" "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a declaration of independence for me, as opposed to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only passively accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Koran.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, questioned, doubting and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">"it was trust and slow devotion, which deepened each reading of the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to tears.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that somebody perceives you, understands you completely, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and began, like all good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came the terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast, looked at the screen and saw the word" "breaking news." ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, aircraft flew into buildings, people jumped from the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical fault?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into outrage.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should I do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists...", "... in the name of Islam...,"... "Middle Eastern descent...", "..." Jihad... "..." bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"it is not only my country that has been attacked, but in the Nu, the actions of others have transformed me from a citizen into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to travel through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start building up studies."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember, as we rode -- as we rode in silence -- so deep it went down into my seat, and I first feared to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"then I heard, saw and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said:" be alert, "" Be careful, "" Be careful, "" Don't move in well lit areas. ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed indoors all the week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims gathered for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings were:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque might be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims, dragged into the open and struck."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I've got the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can indeed hear people say," There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close musk.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church like a tumor in the US body.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumour is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumor in the US body, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first responders and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"it may stop some parking spaces, but do not stop terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">The regular visit of a mosque leads to more tolerant of people of other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and like me, a leader of the police in the Washington area, DC recently told: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalized in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"when first, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family so that the extremism group may have a brainwashing, which causes the person to believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behavior and ideology is a traitor or belief."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalization, we must stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some people still argue that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS creates its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human, I believe that we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imagination if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam like the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you take a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding Imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said the problem was exactly the opposite. every clergyman with whom she spoke, silenced her and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that makes sense to its anger, it was a major goal for the instrumentalization of extremists, who promised a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and its church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing them of their anger, he showed their constructive ways for real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she protected from joining the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight as to how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But what about ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, to our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"one study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we accept rather an authoritarian governance, conformity, and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"one study shows that if people present messages in which negative reports were reported on Muslims, they were more likely to attack Muslim countries as well as the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at when the mood rises against Muslims, between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two electoral periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not just the natural reaction to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">It can indeed be a tool for manipulating the public to undermine the foundation of a free society that has reasonable and well informed citizens.</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear hurts us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"when it comes to the assignment of collective guilt, it is not just about having to explain yourself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was an athlete.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talented at the dental clinic, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when has I become such a young man from my brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after Suzanne's visit to her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, killed her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon."</seg>

<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after the 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we staying safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about which America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can freely exercise our religion."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat, we rode in silence, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, pulled out my shoes, went to the prayer hall, and what I saw let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, for half of the assembly was Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who had come not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">"at that moment, I collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had panicked and prejudiced pangs and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you pick at the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: well, Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve."</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billion dollar business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air package launch into our social awareness, an autonomous fleet of flying machines in the Frac Centre in France built a six-meter high tower of 1 500 bricks in front of the audience."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting, flying devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build up-to-yourself tension-resistant structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear burdens, to deal with turbulence and to react in general to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to function autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zürich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to focus on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratories."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each aircraft has internal sensors to determine position in space and determine what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available on the highest level. for example," "Start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear-starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to hit two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters it can float, and has great advantages in launching and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A restriction of stern starters is that they are sensitive to turbulence such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">"the idea behind it is that the aircraft doesn't matter in which position, the optimum position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practising."</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">Such a question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">Helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts to get together to hurt you.</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly away controlled aircraft that had only two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">We recently discovered that flying with just one works.</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanically simple remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and cross-sections, no further actuation drives or controller surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, a lot happens inside the inner life so that it can fly solidly and move anywhere in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"however, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the hedge-starters. to get it to fly, I must throw it exactly right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of just throwing it right when everyone is watching is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monospinner is an exercise in vigilance, this machine is here, the Omnicopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that he is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">That is why it is ambivalent in its alignment.</seg>
<seg id="446">"thus, it receives the most extraordinary ability,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"move in the room in all directions, no matter what direction he is shot or even how it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of the interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some things are possible in models, the rest is learned directly while flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's take a look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two-propeller flight machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This turns clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when one builds them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"but if something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller dies off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can continue to fly, albeit constrained."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by flipping a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examines synthetic swarms.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercially available Micro-Quadcopters -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in the room it is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations will motivate you to imagine new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">The particularly safe machine over there would like to be a flying lamp shade on Broadway.</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us wages are in development and act of creation.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder of how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago two black holes were circled each other in a very distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns turned into pure energy in a tenth of a second."</seg>
<seg id="470">This short moment they lit more brightly than all the stars along in all galaxies of the entire known universe.</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">"their energy, however, did not set them free in the form of light --"</seg>
<seg id="473">Finally we speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was released into space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">"first, we arrange the events time."</seg>
<seg id="476">"1.3 billion years ago, several zelliges ago was created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then the Earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, people and -- God is standing on us -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of the Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector to search for gravitational-waves, which arise approximately by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses, so the US National Science Foundation financed its idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-waves-observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the following years, the precision of Ligo could be significantly increased, which greatly improved detection performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">Therefore it is called Advanced Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in early September 2015, Ligo was launched for a final test run to solve some minor, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detector was commissioned, the gravitational waves roamed through the earth through the two colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">"in essence, they were the fruits of my life."</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes and her by observatories like ligo measurable signals for 23 years. but what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a crimping in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and pushed into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative purposes, teachers in the theory of relativity play a really silly dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and stow, stretch and stow."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on the 14th of September, for example, each one of us was stretched and stowed when the waves hit. an average man stretch was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is 20 zeros after comma, followed by one."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometer laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured on less than one thousandth of a nucleus of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classic text about gravitation</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I want to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because so you can make a picture or a map of things by perceiving the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">"with sounds, that is different."</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">For example your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain properties like pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, Alice is talking."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob is interrupting her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"silly Bob,"</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational-waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravity, we can tell about a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, simply chirping: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"the two bodies rotate very quickly, you hear the same chirping with an additional key change. it sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted into the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender's Sound] Somebody knows what to hear, sees this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30 times solar mass, which turn about as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's consider what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, circles around one hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know about it because we have heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">This is the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to researching the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">"on this way, we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible."</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practically or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"a supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in supernovas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes, however, occur at the core that lies hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through as these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate irons as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them as the Big Bang is covered by his own afterglow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"with the help of gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in All things we have never seen, which we will never see, and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first trial we didn't expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this topic: me: the kind of stars that black holes bring forth, like Ligo they observed, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies from prehistoric times. the black holes are the sausage bones for our archaeological work so to speak."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different perspective on the events in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the Big Bang himself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for a year I would say to all," "Yes!" "I was afraid of."</seg>
<seg id="556">"whether it made me nervous, brought me into uncomfortable situations, I forced myself to say" "yes". ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: to do exactly what I was afraid of, eliminated my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear of keeping speeches, my social anxiety -- puff, gone."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">"but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply, to an unexpected. it began with a question of my little ones."</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "kitten" "for inexplicable reasons,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">She asked me if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said: "yes.</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">But it also has an amazing side effect: only recently did I fully understand that the "yes" say to playing with my children saved my career.</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am the author. I think of things, wake up to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I create television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for putting 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are in production at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="588">Every program offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode, every nine days, four shows, ie all nine days 20 million dollars TV, four television programs, 70 hours of TV, three broadcasts that simultaneously are in production four times four, 16 episodes simultaneously: 24 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">$350 million for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series run successively on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I created myself, and not just produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, bonfires that burn around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who does that?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, that's why I'm a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so that all of you who work so hard, whether you lead a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously if I speak of work so that you understand that I am not just hanging around on the computer and fancier, and it is true when I say: I don't understand that it is not about dreams during a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I'm immersed in my work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops when I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a lucid sound, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love working.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable. and the best part is the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work is going well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy street, I could go for it forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people assume, when I explain to them the sums that I'm talking about writing that writing gives me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't get me wrong, it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the hum -- when I began to work and work and make, build, create and collaborate, I discovered this thing, this hum, this energy. the buzz!"</seg>
<seg id="618">The humming is more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The humming is action and activity. the buzz is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The humming is music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a hum, then you can't strive to be different from size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of not being different than striving for greatness, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called Summa.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it also means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps it is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I am not made for failure, and I only know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I'm a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I will, the more broadcasts, the more work there are, the more things at the same time, the more I write history, the more I write history."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">I love work isn't it?</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the buzz, the buzzing, the buzzing."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this hum. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the hum. I am the hum.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this hum?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the buzz stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"revised, overloaded, exaggerated, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are accustomed to the truth that her mummy is a single stitch.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mum will not be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says," "Again, I want to go to Shonda land." ""</seg>
<seg id="646">These are the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are Baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the humming ceased."</seg>
<seg id="649">The humming of the engine silenced.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work anymore.</seg>
<seg id="651">The hum did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My buzz was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no regrets, nothing to delegate, a titanium does not sleep, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no hum.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a pre-show titanium,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I simply had no more fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the hum and the humming was me.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do if what you do, the work you love, suddenly fades?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know, some may think," Look out, stupid author Titan. ""</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do, you do, you do, you do, you love what you do, be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love someone else and that gives you the buzz when you know the buzz when the buzz stops, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out, late and she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I want to say no when two things become clear to me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to everything and secondly, she didn't call me" "kitten." ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She doesn't call anyone "kitten."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did this happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I'm titanium and my humming smokes, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about that.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in the loneliness and absence of the hum, I can do nothing but watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky fingers and wet kisses, delicate voices, waxing pins and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl releases in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air at this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of work.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something in me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door enters and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that doesn't happen immediately, but it happens it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming slowly comes back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, barely there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the humming, but a buzz."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel as if I know a magical secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. just love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the working sum, the titanium hum, that is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am when I complain about broadcasts and TV hours and how functional my brain is, then I forgot what the real buzz is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sum is not a force and it is not labor-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">Real buzz is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The humming is the current that comes from the lust for life.</seg>
<seg id="711">Real buzz is self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums are ignoring the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real buzz is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">I do this as a rule so that I can free myself from any guilt as a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="719">"it's law, I have no choice. I have no choice, if I want to hear the hum again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so easy. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not up to me as much as working.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer to be at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what kind of person would prefer to be than to be a home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan "--"</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we hurried around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We are bursting soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I mainly feel stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always use my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it's ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">"you can also do it! always say yes, if your child wants to play with you."</seg>
<seg id="741">Maybe you hold me naïve for a daydreamer.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something different."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">"after 15 minutes, a ladybird or cookie replaces me."</seg>
<seg id="750">"and when my teen-daughter talks to me for a whole period of 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, more does not need it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"everyone can get 15 minutes a bit, even on a bad day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a day!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are inside!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be children. it is important to feel the humming, have a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">It is not about playing with your own children.</seg>
<seg id="759">To play "games" in general.</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what is good for you.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and preserve it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I will fail and I won. meet friends, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I got a titanium in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more. "</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on a piece why don't you treat yourself to 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about that? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The humming came back in my spare time. the humming then seems to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working doesn't work without games.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the hum, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the hum, the humming is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky finger, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">That is my summing now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The buzz of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totality of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just a part of it. and I am so grateful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">It is a pleasure to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan playing a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still working. my bonfires are still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel like a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the clearer is my head."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the buzz. the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the canvases, the high sound, the humming, the humming, the other, the real buzz: the buzz of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this humming, the more this unusual, dying, naked and new attitude of life in me is wide. less titanium -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this humming, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I'm a writer. I think of things, I'm contemplating you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this belongs to the job, which means to live his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said," "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do every day with human tragedies.</seg>
<seg id="798">I know how your life can change from one second to another after a serious stroke or after a car accident.</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeon it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve nerve functions by different surgical procedures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they have probably heard of one of the best known, the" "deep brain stimulation". "in the process, one implanted a electrode in the brain in order to influence the neurons' circuits in such a way that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is really an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients suffering from Parkinson's who suffered severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"neuromodulation, however, does not mean neuro-healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is to restore the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help itself."</seg>
<seg id="811">History began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was a senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">"often, I provided patients with a skull-brain trauma."</seg>
<seg id="814">They have to imagine that the brain swells in the brain and the cranial pressure increases.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, you have to reduce cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">For this you sometimes have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyze the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity and the environment to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François succeeded."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly the same as a stem cell culture. with large green cells that are surrounded by small, unmature cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from biology classes that stem cells are immature cells, which can transform into every cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they divide very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">"they never die, they are immortal."</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They slowly shared and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population that looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">"in the fetus stage, they cause the brain to fold."</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they retained?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">"however, this is not so safe."</seg>
<seg id="848">"one thing, however, is clear -- from these cells we received our stem cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">"we wanted to remove a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area, and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did."</seg>
<seg id="853">And they are then colored in color to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we reimport them at the taking place of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call autologous transplantation - Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens if we re-implant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen if we re-implant the same cells into damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we reimplantable the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they had been removed again, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added an injury to and reimplantation exactly the same cells and now the cells remained.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been reimplanted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells that we dye in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"here, of course, we couldn't stop."</seg>
<seg id="864">Does these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained monkeys with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from one tablet.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>

<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from before the injury.</seg>

<seg id="876">"now, when we reimplanted the cells: the same monkey, two months after explantation."</seg>

<seg id="884">"Luigi Giussani: Jocelyne, this is wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>

<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, so on."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to the hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will the authority allow us to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select the patients to perform the treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, it is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a great mistake to consider them as self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at it as immutable entity.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism leads inevitably to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a thriving capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is waning with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">At the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was unmistakably clarified to me as Minister of Finance in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our choices -- should not affect the austerity programs realized in Greece.</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my sober friends who told me repeatedly that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to introduce you an economic model for genuine democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe again that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup are mistaken, we could save the democracy, but that we need a genuine and defenceless democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy our societies are mumbling, our future bleak and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point to an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "twin peak Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, which casts its long shadow over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the mountain of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy asparagus and corporations, but are too anxious to invest where it would be productive and bring revenues to produce the debt burden and even produce all the things humanity urgently needs, such as" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, $3.4 trillion has been invested in the United States, England and the eurozone, invested in all the prosperity producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so on."</seg>
<seg id="922">"4 trillion US dollars sounds like a lot of money until one compares it to the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing, except to inflate the stock markets and boost real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus debts and unproductive capital form the twin peaks, which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old in the United States, Japan and Europe jobless, and consequently a low overall economic demand, which, like in an endless loop, advocates the pessimism of investors, who would be true that his son would kill him if he grows up,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally bring about the circumstances causing the body to kill it.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my Hader with Capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, to develop human talents and especially finance all of the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">But before we continue: what do we mean by democracy?</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, athenical democracy included too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to mitigate the importance of Athenian democracy due to these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive thing about Athenian democracy was and is that she withdrew the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which gave them the right to political co-determination with equal voice weighting in matters of state affairs."</seg>
<seg id="935">"" "the athenian democracy has not held long."</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines brightly, it is burnt out quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our liberal democracies don't have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of the Magna Carta, which ultimately was a byword for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"liberal democracy first arose when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, there was a relentless struggle between the two, as the economy gradually undermines politics and disfigured it."</seg>
<seg id="942">Wondering why politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not due to a degeneration of its DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because nowadays it is possible to be in the government, and still not in power, because the power of politics has emigrated to the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my hatred with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about like a herd of carnivores that so sustainably decimated the animals from which it feeds on, that they end up starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are being devalued, inequality increases, the macroeconomic demand falls, and the managers of the corporations are too frightened to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" demos "out of democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to reassemble politics and economy, and it would be better if the" demos "retains the control, just as in ancient Athens, except for the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left had already had this idea 100 years ago and it was not very good.</seg>
<seg id="952">"the lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens, without creating new ways of brutality and waste."</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers by automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin peaks higher, the waste of sublime, and social conflicts deeper, as it is -- very soon as I believe -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must reorganize the economy and reunite the fields of economy and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a diseased surveillance hyperautocracy which makes the movie" Matrix "like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements it produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is superseded by a dystopia, similar to that in" matrix, "in which machines are used to human beings, or into a high-tech version of ancient Athens" Agora, "indulging in long conversations with the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we must be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it take, how could it look like having this" Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" matrix "like dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you a few examples."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies: please imagine a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital follows you from one job to another, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter which one is working -- is the property of those currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all revenues from capital and income come from, and the concept of wage labor is completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction is made between those who belong to the company but who do not work in it, and employees who work there, but who do not belong to them. no more exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin peaks."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the realm of global political economy, please imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of 20 largest emerging countries], in the interests of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum equivalent to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in green technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">That is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have it, especially against the background of a reunified policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe is at the same time a liberal in which it prefers privileged persons, and Marxist, because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the bin of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a real democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world?</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratically."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">"Bruno Giussani, Yanis..."</seg>
<seg id="980">You write yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers describes as" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from a part of the Earth to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will destabilise only our democracies but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, then Marx is absolutely relevant."</seg>
<seg id="986">"just like Hayek, that's why I am a Libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and therefore I am completely confused."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: in fact, and now we are."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually, it was Einstein who said this."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of a democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most plays out -- the area of economics -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some ways, if I can say this so provocatively, China is today like the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"because -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically regarded."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what can be observed now in China is similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">Now to accuse China of doing what the West has done in the 19th century smells like hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about your experience as Greek Finance Minister at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I knew that would come.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later for the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new start with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say good-bye to us from the self-complacency, and the continuous denial that a massive fault line went through the eurozone, and continues to threaten the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, on the basis of the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial."</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European Group, have continued to deny denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">That is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if one tries an economic system that is not viable to live by political will and authoritarianism, one might delay it for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destroys."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you anticipate?</seg>
<seg id="1013">"YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future, if we do not change its structure."</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a minister of finance or any minister who, after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, asserts that he has made no mistake, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the renewal of the debt program at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest on the sides of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But that was not the case.</seg>
<seg id="1022">They merely wanted to drop our government because they did not want to deal with the distortions that went through the eurozone.</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they had been conducting a disastrous program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the Great Depression.</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the troika's troika, who imposed this policy on us, said:" this was a colossal mistake. "</seg>

<seg id="1038">"Roy Price has never heard most of them, although he is probably responsible for 22 mid-minutes of your life on April 19, 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">"probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes, but not for very many of you."</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">"Roy Price is an employee at Amazon Studios,"</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igeleats and describes himself on Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for selecting the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy cannot choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the assessment distribution of more than 2,500 TV series on the website IMDB. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows this assessment is received."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive to where, after you have watched a squadron, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think you need special intelligence to entertain" "Toddlers and Tiaras". ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the mean deportation, average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't inspire."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time that Amazon does something like that, so Roy Price wants to risk nothing."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes a lot of ideas for TV shows and, through an evaluation, selects eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where everyone can watch them for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon doesn't get things out for nothing, it's up to you to do it right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can record when you start the show, when you pause, which parts are skipped or looked again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and hence the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom about four Republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," "Alpha House", "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House ended at 7.5 -- therefore something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for Netflix program design."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of staging a contest, he and his team looked at the available data about the Netflix audience, so the ratings they give to the shows their course shows which shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out about the audience these little details: which shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what has happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"there are two very competitive, data-savvy companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">They connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them but not for the other company.</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow says that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good television, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work, this is a bit scary because we live in a time when we take more and more statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anybody know the company Multi-Health Systems?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in prison in the United States and asks for dismissal, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a dismissal is carried out or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always producing the best results. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of the most experienced companies are incorrect.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can predict breakthroughs of influenza, the wicked way -- through data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked out wonderfully and was a great news sensation. the success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked flawlessly, year around year by year, until suddenly it didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And nobody could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply didn't work, this was again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these errors, data stream into decisions of life -- at work, in law enforcement, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics - an area where some very clever people unimaginably use a lot of data to make serious decisions, such as the decision for a cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a drug. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, put this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyse the individual parts; as a branch, you put the individual parts together again to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help break down a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to reassemble the parts and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all possess it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something in which the brain is good, it is to reassemble parts and pieces even if the information is incomplete, in order to gain a good conclusion -- especially if it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"therefore, I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and intelligence where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, what they otherwise wouldn't have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like" House of Cards "does not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a big personal risk with this decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all of their choices first when they were competing for TV ideas, then they chose" "Alpha House" "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a secure decision because they could always say: "this is what the data tells us.</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order not to forget this, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a hunting or no question you just need to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will challenge it later with a technical demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="1132">So far I have made some decisions in my life and I should have listened to the ball in hindsight.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you naturally know, if you have the data available, you want to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it's up to us to make decisions when we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data, it is still worth taking decisions to make decisions, to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"because in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
