Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren hospital where young people are to meet today .
a pit chapel that is now excav@@ ated for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
gar@@ den@@ ers farm the former ground of farmers .
Munich &apos;s oldest official map promotes exciting stories for days .
it gets annoying when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this because the car navigation device showed a green gla@@ de instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bavaria @-@ at@@ las , an offer of the ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but topical - but precisely therefore very revealing . &quot;
especially if you compare them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur since the 19th century .
the digital Bavaria @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that one cannot recognize as such .
&quot; the large overview map was incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; original position papers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these were created according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying business between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and from the first survey of Bavaria .
your client : Napoleon .
&quot; the French army leader occupied Bavaria since early 1800 , during the Second Coalition War with Austria . &quot;
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a top@@ ographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops with@@ drew with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 , it was the neighbours today who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV . Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian sur@@ veying business . &quot;
&quot; the composition sheet for Munich dates back to the year 18@@ 56 , and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library . &quot;
the comparison earlier / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .
the city has expanded into all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; S@@ end@@ ling was conven@@ ed 21 years after the creation of the map , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling is located in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the present Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where the West@@ park is today , one sees nothing as fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ written numbered pieces of land from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; primitive inst@@ al@@ ation &quot; &quot; from which the land tax was derived . &quot;
small par@@ c@@ els now do not occupy farmers anymore - but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the &quot; land in the sun . &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ sen@@ d@@ ling .
&quot; the Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the scene of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the original position , in the area of the present district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; on Gast@@ eig &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; On the ventilation &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße one once locked people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 the Munich District Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ ft@@ edness &quot; &quot; was created there . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and for example ended the kno@@ cking of the so @-@ called Ir@@ ren .
&quot; he also prohibited the personnel to use force against deta@@ inees , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who worked for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients first place was first , later it was expanded to 500 places . &quot;
at some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k pension in Haar in 1905 .
&quot; since 2006 , the Is@@ ar Amp@@ er Hospital Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts . &quot;
young people now meet in the Munich Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um on the grounds of the former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth shelter with educational establishments .
&quot; west is the football field of the TS@@ V München East , East dwell@@ ings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was erected in an architectural style to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ au , which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed as the main square in 18@@ 56 , the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lied bombs broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a large remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a chapel chapel from the Middle Ages were once situated at the Mari@@ enhof , where the preliminary work and the ground@@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn station took place on 5 April 2017 . &quot;
&quot; with the slider , you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof . &quot;
civil Rights Group publishes tour warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Association for Col@@ ors has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i due to the discrimin@@ atory policy and rac@@ ist attacks on the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , ur@@ ges Af@@ ro @-@ American travellers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention while travelling through the state , as a number of question@@ able , racial @-@ based incidents occur in the entire state and are noted here , &quot; &quot; says the Group . &quot;
&quot; a recently passed law by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state who are dispro@@ portion@@ ate to minorities , led the group to release the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of the civil rights that happen to humans .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died in question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more gasoline during the journey and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police , without being accused of a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report of the Office of Mis@@ sour@@ i At@@ tor@@ ney General , showing that black mot@@ orists in the state will be 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people have to be willing to accept deposits or let relatives know that they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime report , listing the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country . &quot;
the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law that would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company because of housing or employment discrimination .
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had passed immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities are committed to arrest people because of immigration violations , which will contribute to further race recognition in the opinion of the AC@@ L@@ U . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have deployed the measure as a response to specific laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the fishing village Wei@@ de@@ vil@@ n project is a successful project and will continue next year .
the CD@@ U members of parliament Peter White and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac provided a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family court yard , representatives of the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s CD@@ U @-@ village association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first provided insights into his farm , in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommod@@ ates in five apartments Feri@@ eng@@ a@@ este . &quot;
&quot; for him the &quot; &quot; Black Forest &quot; &quot; is the alternative channel for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste exclusively regional .
&quot; since he is also the chairman of Fis@@ her@@ bach &apos;s B@@ L@@ H@@ V , he described the electric fence project as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit on such steep faces .
the grass@@ land provision for a lot of work and much has to be worked on with the br@@ ush@@ cutter .
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it did not lead a bio@@ economy . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the promotion of leaders . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
I hope so that the aff@@ or@@ estation of the faces could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they carry on their business , &quot; &quot; emphas@@ ised the mayor . &quot;
&quot; because of the promotion , farmers are often in the critic@@ isms &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area is therefore 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested by at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; of the total cost of € 71 million , half was promoted by leaders , a quarter bearing the municipality of Fis@@ her@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers had to invest 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in a pasture fence of 16.@@ 2 kilometres . &quot;
&quot; the big advantage is the lon@@ gevity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you are doing a really good job without farmers and rural women . &quot;
Peter White also noted : &quot; best food is produced here . &quot;
the landscape care guidelines ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg will enable the state support of pasture f@@ ences .
the aim is to keep the Black Forest open .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
&quot; moreover , the enclosed area must not be smu@@ pper@@ ed ( incl@@ ination over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by the aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; the request of eight participants with 24 pitches , which is almost 16 kilometres of fence , is currently underway for the 2018 Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Electric Vehicle launch project . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more holy ?
now the White House of Tr@@ ump is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Fir@@ a Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tr@@ ump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the President &apos;s proposals for dr@@ astic reduction of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to remain fair , Miller gra@@ bbed the statue himself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty @-@ I@@ mit@@ ators would have n@@ ched him if he had done it .
&quot; but he took on their meaning , and especially the importance that was attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enligh@@ tens the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is impro@@ per@@ ly correct , but as he put it himself , it &apos;s not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state not only invites some old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your arms , your oppressed masses who long to breathe freely , and the miserable waste of your rich shores . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; miserable garbage &quot; was better to see on our screens .
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Tr@@ ump@@ et USA are not welcome .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .
&quot; Lazarus - and her friends , who sat down to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they had accomplished a highly political action . &quot;
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classic portra@@ yal .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the Ex@@ il@@ ants .
the combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American na@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and exactly as Lazarus has changed the significance of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tr@@ ump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody , but rather an early neo@@ conservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues . &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
&quot; quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh has stum@@ bled upon something here . &quot;
the significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative deed of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the tru@@ est sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tr@@ ump ever want to recognize . &quot;
&quot; their torch will not enligh@@ ten the way , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black sings Scottish members of the Great Britain Team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle is reminiscent of a time when only two Scot@@ ties belonged to the team of Great Britain
&quot; the performance director of the UK &apos;s Ath@@ le@@ tics Games , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ piece Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world cup competition will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
&quot; a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London in 2017 , starting on Friday . &quot;
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special is developed &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK have to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are med@@ als candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ t - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was chosen by the team to captain the team captain . &quot;
&quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest .
&quot; her speech was incredible , &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
the passion and the real feeling that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h naturally brought in were great .
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in her fifth World Championships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says it is &quot; &quot; incredible &quot; &quot; that 16 Scottish people are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the central aisle runner Mu@@ ir goes on this path and last year set up five British and two European records .
&quot; it will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch after a great season , which included the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world championships when the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell was .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also med@@ als and fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chosen me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I &apos;m very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to po@@ di@@ ums . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin .
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there .
block critics on Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you can &apos;t tolerate the heat @-@ up of voters
the father of our country knew something from bad press .
&quot; Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the papers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he shr@@ ank in criticism , certainly . &quot;
but he has not sil@@ enced his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , sil@@ ly and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
&quot; that brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who needs to work to be more like Washington . &quot;
Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union accused him of this at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff dismissed the complaint as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is especially important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a Repub@@ lican Gover@@ nor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary hot@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very clever in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to de@@ bug his hair@@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons who come to the governor &apos;s side - which is a public forum designated as officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan &apos;s spokesperson Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the Gover@@ nor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hate @-@ filled people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are only true people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a business@@ man and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not profound . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s ca@@ tho@@ lic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , and some of them are rather dis@@ regarded as a collective employment rather than a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s employees labeled as &quot; concentrated spam attacks &quot; would probably call others &quot; interc@@ ession . &quot;
the Facebook Er@@ a simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or canc@@ elling a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but that &apos;s exactly what happens digitally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
Twitter users are su@@ ed by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones on this issue fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County wounded the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexand@@ ria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this shouldn &apos;t be so hard .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable por@@ tos had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters hit on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had an anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people using pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote letters to the newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; critic@@ ised his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with the UK , his ministry was overwhel@@ med , according to historical documents collected by the online Pap@@ ers of the George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not silence her .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses form the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true leadership means accepting that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in the Ar@@ cher@@ field Links to the En@@ dr@@ unde , before he lost against Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from his best side , he is in a great condition . &quot;
Jer@@ ry did a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that really feels special , &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot;
I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it &apos; a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win here last year . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to European Senior Tour this year after his 50@@ th birthday , returns to the promotion on home soil . &quot;
this event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you &apos;re playing at home , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ r , the man of Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I &apos;m glad how it went so far .
&quot; the trio on the field are former masters of masters Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ eil . &quot;
&quot; OR@@ R and former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce are among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dr@@ um@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the parking lot costs £ 5 per car with a passenger and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died due to passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the University Medical Center Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking per year , &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
domestic inclu@@ sions prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Strasse are in full swing and &quot; are reasonably in time , &quot; says the Head of the Station Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than assumed , since there is a lot of hiding in the underground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which always hin@@ ders construction work , is a major problem for St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s construction company . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of mot@@ orists in front of red lights and shut @-@ off gates is enormous , &quot; &quot; reports Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is locked and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ tran@@ z and Tim Ko@@ tran@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; the hot days were already quite exhau@@ sting .
&quot; but luckily we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ tran@@ z . &quot;
poverty and death in the Indon@@ esian gold country
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the uns@@ ett@@ led Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the carb@@ oni@@ zed tu@@ ber is removed and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as clothes with mur@@ ky water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a homeless room serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course it can be dangerous to work late : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink hard and there are soldiers . &quot;
&quot; no one dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony that was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders should vote by a public lift in front of the occup@@ ying forces . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence of the Dutch government , quickly turned against the government of Jak@@ arta , which enter@@ tains control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea took part in the eastern part of the island . &quot;
the trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the rental car .
there is no public transport .
&quot; the city , with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants , consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fence and of corrugated sheets converted by rust into different yellow @-@ brown tones . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian mission@@ aries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ an ad@@ ored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i and points to her lively , hand@@ woven tur@@ ban , dark shirt and her bright skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we had only leaves on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst inf@@ ra @-@ mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass Mountain , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high@@ land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port accounted for $ 3.1 billion of gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua dispos@@ es of wood resources valued at estimated $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua that ensures that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid nearly $ 20 million in local military units and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden go@@ ose and are ruth@@ lessly treated .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500@@ ,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been ra@@ ped , tortured and imprisoned in 1969 by the Indon@@ esian military . &quot;
&quot; mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal high@@ land in the 1970s , according to the Asia Human Rights Commission , were committed to genocide . &quot;
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year . &quot;
&quot; we &quot; &quot; stre@@ ak all things &quot; &quot; in a report by the arch@@ dioc@@ ese of Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , which reports about atro@@ cities in the previous year , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electrical strikes are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims each week , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia Res@@ ear@@ cher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; the bolts have strengthened , as Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring about an influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i come . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ung cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and g@@ ado g@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep up here .
&quot; the migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua , &quot; says A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year old Pan@@ i@@ ai indigenous who moved to the province capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native Papua , the Mama @-@ M@@ om &#91; the women &#93; of Papua - their market . &quot;
&quot; during his campaign in 2014 , Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , promised to address ine@@ qualities and legal violations in Papua . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jok@@ o , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ o &apos;s initiation in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should switch on their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers fired her tone and later returned with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their ri@@ fle but@@ ts , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was severely beaten to fall into the coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young people , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice . &quot;
they carried cerem@@ onial hunting bends and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - in the circle continuously and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to spin stones at police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; says it in an official TI@@ ME document that was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the leader of the K@@ ego K@@ oto @-@ district of En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali , saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called on the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was listening to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his multi@@ colored painted wood house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ak still does not know who has fired , but says that the ball from the ranks of the assembled soldiers came . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ m was hit three times , according to his c@@ ousin , the witness of the exec@@ utions . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who , like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , only carries a name , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief spec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , re@@ porters said that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station because they were being attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , &quot; said Commissioner of the Papua police commission@@ er Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news on the kill@@ ings was &quot; filtered &quot; only the following day after Jak@@ arta .
&quot; in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech for three weeks in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and sw@@ elled to tackle the historic gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , Minister of Security , Wi@@ ran@@ to , said that he would advocate an out @-@ of @-@ court mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 @-@ ern and beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations , but there are processes that must be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; charged by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; which caused more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence referendum of 1999 , Wi@@ ran@@ to said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been settled , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims received such claims with gri@@ mm@@ ed un@@ belief .
&quot; I have been inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there have been no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m tired . &quot;
he says he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , afraid of being shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus reiter@@ ated the view that the people of Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the bodies , the military searched for me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the gun@@ fights have not ceased .
&quot; on Tuesday , the Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood of Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company ref@@ using to bring a man unconscious to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year old ra@@ vi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited groups of villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing up warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ gade ( Indon@@ esian police ) began shooting at the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were in panic , we are afraid that revenge will be given , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered , such as the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called on the officers to be held ac@@ coun@@ table and withdraw the police &apos;s mobile bri@@ gade .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always a troub@@ le@@ maker for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the clan members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and Dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many of them joined the &quot; Free Papua Movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua by attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings by Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ den Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily deta@@ ined in custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never pop up again .
&quot; among the people of Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; &quot; tragic , forgotten place &quot; . &quot; &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ satisfaction .
the little rice that is sold in En@@ ar@@ ot@@ ali is too expensive for locals .
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
&quot; agriculture is the task of women , who can process four or five fields of sweet potato . &quot;
they keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the launch of new routes to the Nab@@ ire airport . &quot;
&quot; as a rule , the few jobs that exist in the region go to the better educated and well @-@ to @-@ do migrants . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they rarely have the capital or the necessary skills in order to make their own companies competitive . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the panel board of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , international media coverage remains ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Es@@ cu@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were de@@ ported from Papua because of the lack of coordination with related institutions , although the rare permission was given to them for filming . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ o &apos;s election campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia &apos;s uns@@ ett@@ led eastern provinces of Papua and West Pap@@ ua : visa refusal and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the Group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia , there is still a democratic system and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the human rights ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on 4 May , local people broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but wants to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua claims that they will probably not vote again for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ o is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , the chairman of the stock market . &quot;
&quot; he wants to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , apart from being under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , are in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jok@@ o as a &quot; guilt &quot; he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they want just justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite the threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai @-@ gun@@ men carried out a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the cor@@ pse of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that they might never come to justice , but at least they don &apos;t let those responsible forget their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capturing the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest dwell@@ ings in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 3@@ 37 @-@ metre @-@ high , 79 @-@ storey buildings . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that swe@@ eps through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is accidentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the cries of the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor down , &quot; &quot; a resident told his name as George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were extingu@@ ishing the fire at 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooling the building .
the government said it is working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can resur@@ rec@@ t questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 found that the largest part of the damage from facing , the exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation , came . &quot;
&quot; in Britain , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has failed with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup single was not supported by the required two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; the five @-@ set classics , which are often very long , but also very cher@@ ished five @-@ set classics , are thus preserved . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of member countries voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F president David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ alised . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member@@ ships will not have adopted the whole package of reform for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical cont@@ ests , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
we will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not until the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal came to the final in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; as of 2018 , only comparatively small details will be available : the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will have the host right next round in the next round in the next round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training stations etc. will be facilit@@ ated and players will have to complete less formal media appointments before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers take forbidden objects to the aircraft , find out a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey among flying passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of intentionally or un@@ consciously forbidden objects were smu@@ g@@ gled along the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 per cent of the aircraft , while accidentally wearing prohibited knives or other objects with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent said they had late discovered that they had mistakenly travelled with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey of more than 1,000 people , carried out by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers were more likely to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; the respon@@ dents , who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , were 19.@@ 7 percent Mill@@ enni@@ als , compared to less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common objects that were pur@@ pos@@ ely passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent claimed to have know@@ ingly carried objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female sur@@ vey@@ ed and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought illegal drugs into the plane . &quot;
the company said it consul@@ ted travelers throughout the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled goods through airport security and how many had intentionally done it .
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who fly most frequently . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of it .
&quot; therefore , it is no surprise that the bulk of the liquids seized by the T@@ SA are prohibited fluids . &quot;
&quot; for a while , people thought that the T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t care : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel Order
electri@@ cian El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la Model 3 .
&quot; so far , he has been suggest@@ ing that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; alongside the constantly triumph@@ ant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time revealed a different , less gl@@ itter@@ ing figure at the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet : the cancellation in the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had more than 500@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders for the new car , whose delivery currently begins . &quot;
&quot; now , Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders 6@@ 3.000 have already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are simply non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation Tes@@ la will pay the 1,000 euros ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; Reser@@ vation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ ,000 of such non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age , in a telephone conference with analysts , in a telephone conference . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders up to now could be a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; 2018 : all models will be taken together - 500@@ ,000 , by 2020 one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obviously there .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day . &quot;
&quot; if you order a &quot; Model 3 &quot; today , you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive its brand @-@ new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , with maximum capacity utilisation . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if there are too much delays , then the un@@ binding obligation of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EP@@ O Chief P@@ ru@@ itt reti@@ res because of the hes@@ itation of the Obama Er@@ a rules to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after he had been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , head of the Environmental Protection Agency , res@@ igned his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt presented the changes , when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations . &quot;
he did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
it is about a period which expi@@ red on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standard o@@ zone standards .
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the observ@@ ance of one year in order to give its authority more time to study the plan , and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was named after his appointment by President Donald Tr@@ ump Public Prosecutor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental protection regulations for a long time . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed on to block or delay regulation , to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels continue to resist . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ction Reg@@ arding roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a statement published on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that his turn @-@ around with o@@ zone standards simply rein@@ forces the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA often did not meet dead@@ lines for implementation and then waited to be indic@@ ted by groups of activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take dead@@ lines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the EPA statement that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually use its &quot; power to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a broader re @-@ constitution of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not yet voted in the Senate .
&quot; the New York At@@ tor@@ ney General Eric Schnei@@ der@@ man , who led the coalition of states which had accused the EPA this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.@@ 7 million New Yor@@ kers and the over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smo@@ g that flows into their communities , &quot; &quot; said Schnei@@ der@@ man . &quot;
&quot; in this case , New York joined California , Connec@@ ti@@ cut , Del@@ aware , Il@@ lin@@ ois , I@@ owa , Ma@@ ine , Massachusetts , Minn@@ es@@ ota , New Mexico , Oreg@@ on , Penn@@ syl@@ van@@ ian , Rho@@ de Island , Ver@@ mont and Washington and the District of Columbia . &quot;

&quot; it is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this reasonable step from the responsible for the protection of the air we inhal@@ e , &quot; &quot; said Lor@@ i Ann Bur@@ d of the Center for Bi@@ ological Di@@ versity . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we must continue to fight against the ideological Crus@@ ade of the Tr@@ ump government to turn to environmental contam@@ in@@ ants and their special interests . &quot;
Tum@@ lingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a seren@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30 pm . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius @-@ complex is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chan@@ ted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and pat@@ rons of tur@@ mo@@ il to their concern .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphas@@ ises : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische Ur@@ jav@@ ík : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church on it , together with the Vo@@ g@@ t@@ ei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the document of the document , apart from the former parish church , apart from the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard to which the church or the pat@@ ron@@ age belonged and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Freu@@ den@@ stadt Ober@@ am@@ tes Freu@@ den@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the town@@ scape of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; is the third , the community centre of the village . &quot;
old maps from the time around 1600 prove this historical situation .
the privilege of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
&quot; a master , who built a church , re@@ ared up and occupied with a priest , continued to remain the owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath this own church . &quot;
it was connected with the right to appoint a priest or to appoint a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two was sh@@ attered on Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
during the Thir@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) the window pan@@ es were inserted and the bell rings were stolen .
the roof was le@@ aking .
in 17@@ 96 French troops camp@@ ed near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the rem@@ nants of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned .
only the church tower was left standing .
&quot; during the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 , a storm split the church tower and half collap@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was broken down . &quot;
&quot; only the tower , which still exists today , was preserved as a witness to the 750 year old church history . &quot;
&quot; today , Horst K@@ allen@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em care for Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn &apos;s Hil@@ arius @-@ system as successor to Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; as an organizer , the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ arc invite to the old cemetery in St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kap@@ elle on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth ser@@ en@@ ade . &quot;
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of Ke@@ pler Gymnasium Freu@@ den@@ stadt and with contributions by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann speaks the closing word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
admission is from 3.@@ 30 p.@@ m .
&quot; to conclude the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the gra@@ vey@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , &quot; the organizers emphasize the fantastic view . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of great importance for tum@@ ors and listeners . &quot;
the friends and pat@@ rons of Tum@@ bl@@ itz are particularly committed to their home care as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ ms .
association wants to insp@@ ect permission of wind turbines
&quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim refuses &quot; sees no legal pre@@ condition for the construction and therefore has turned to the Coun@@ cill@@ or .
the club &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim fights &quot; has called for Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette .
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval no wind turbines could have been approved at the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette at the time of approval , as at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the city border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there existed a wind power concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; in this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; such zones are intended to prevent &quot; &quot; as@@ par@@ ag@@ us &quot; &quot; of the landscape . &quot;
&quot; only a few days before , the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind turbine zone in the N@@ ette Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette by a change in the land use plan - but it had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf , because of an inf@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted per@@ mitting case is still illegal and therefore also withdraw , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , president of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the city council has once again approved the wind concentration zone in the N@@ ette of Bo@@ is@@ heim ; approval by the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; in this respect , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the establishment of wind power plants is legally prec@@ lu@@ ded . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been addressed by the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; declared a speaker . &quot;
the circle takes them as an opportunity to examine the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the proceedings to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heim hub . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen was indirectly involved , had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 @-@ hect@@ are area . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - that is roughly one @-@ fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ leg@@ ged households . &quot;
the NEW Re plans to invest some 20 million euros .
last summer Vier@@ sen &apos;s city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Lin@@ ni@@ ch near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the district Hein@@ sberg .
car and tractor crash together : woman dies with terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhein @-@ L@@ ahn circle ) .
a woman was injured in death .
two more people were easily injured .
the country road was closed for hours .
&quot; according to police instructions , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch with her car in the context of the accompanying driving with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion , drove the L 3@@ 33 towards Bo@@ gel . &quot;
town and dealer plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bathroom Lan@@ gen@@ dei@@ a@@ er and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping possibilities in the city centre in September .
&quot; the business association and the municipal administration intend to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 , to l@@ ure the inhabitants for shopping in the city centre . &quot;
&quot; as the chairman of the business association , Christian König , announced , the &quot; Heimat@@ land @-@ shopping &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers their own town apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; therefore , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local companies are to present themselves with their training places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite for &quot; midnight shopping . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action aims not only on residents of the city and the region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation are commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König . &quot;
the municipal administration and business association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
&quot; in this way , the business association and the city go to a further stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive city center . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offerings such as the first &quot; &quot; active day &quot; &quot; to the well festival with sal@@ eable Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ men and hosts to make them active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers for Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on that day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials are to be re@@ developed or re @-@ opened . &quot;
this includes passengers and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre when shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to en@@ li@@ ven the city centre - to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; in the spring , a network of le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy was required to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy . &quot;
&quot; Bir@@ git St@@ reich , head of the I@@ HK @-@ Center in Müh@@ l@@ hausen admitted that Germany &apos;s third &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; was the first to participate in five Thurin@@ gian cities for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and Blei@@ cher@@ ode . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Industry and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen with his buying behaviour can influence his direct en@@ cro@@ achment on their own .
two dead and several wounded after explosion at U.S. school
during construction work there was a gas explosion in the school building .
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were wounded , some of them were difficult . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire department , the Wednesday ( local time ) was still in critical condition . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building collap@@ sed at the explosion .
a first missing was also found dead later .
the dead were employees of the school .
&quot; as a matter of fact , the authorities suspected works on a gas pipeline . &quot;
at the holiday season there were only a few people in the Min@@ neh@@ aha Academy building .
Tr@@ ump put pressure on trans@@ liter@@ ation of telephone calls to Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the boundary wall
tran@@ scripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Tr@@ ump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tr@@ ump asked En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to publicly to say that he would not pay for a planned boundary wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president shr@@ ank him because he publicly denoun@@ ced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump ki@@ cked off his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed an anxious exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump said Mr. Turn@@ bull , that a trade for the US refugees who emig@@ rated to Australia would be &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; bad &quot; and &quot; stupid &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; Dep@@ p &quot; after he proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump ended the call after he told Mr. Turn@@ bull , &quot; that &apos;s the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : milit@@ ants run rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ old Ford Mer@@ cury traveled through a group of spectators in Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ ank to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men stepped out with ri@@ fl@@ es to block its way . &quot;
the leader of mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer &apos;s suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ screen .
in@@ doors the in@@ mates were in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ aming broke the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
&quot; luckily this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a reproduction . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience met very real si@@ ghs . &quot;
since 2005 civil rights activists have come back to Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge to mim@@ ic the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were synthes@@ ized by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 .
no one ever was charged with murder .
&quot; it is really in@@ conceivable that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who assi@@ sts in organizing the post@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a strain on our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a life @-@ long civil rights activ@@ ist .
it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected .
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot get to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a for@@ en@@ sic doctor lays a blanket over the body of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ching on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI agents , received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the ly@@ n@@ ching process . &quot;
but none has ever been indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain on the loose for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for the Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a Supreme Court decision made it possible for the Black residents to vote in Georgia for the first time in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the choice stab@@ s a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , according to the FBI &apos;s black color watch@@ dog Roger Mal@@ com , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she wore was not of her husband .
&quot; on 25 July 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her c@@ ous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they got away from prison and approached Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , Har@@ rison , who has prepared and arranged the mur@@ ders , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed the evidence and changed the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a right to vote , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is illustr@@ ative , po@@ ign@@ ant , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to watch , and to see more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching , because then we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or don &apos;t want to hear what I &apos;ve done through .
&quot; the rehear@@ s@@ als for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen White and the rest bl@@ acks - went into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of the leader @-@ clan member for years , but he said that the roll will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not so , &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; but I think it is very important to keep this story alive , because we don &apos;t want to return to those times . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the high priest cries out and p@@ ushes him , fur@@ i@@ ously that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he , disappear from my property ! &quot;
An@@ cona returns the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Gr@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still chu@@ ck@@ ling . &quot;
I just don &apos;t think white people said &apos; n --- he &apos; .
&quot; but &quot; , &quot; one of the other black performers wit@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship is replacing the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene begins once more .
&quot; this time , if Ras@@ cona says the N @-@ word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are scre@@ ams , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman wearing a mourning @-@ dress , stands above the cor@@ p@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays &apos; mour@@ n@@ ful speech called &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
their voice breaks every second word .
about a hundred yards behind it a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears out of their eyes .
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , traveled to see the performance , many just come down the street . &quot;
they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture every nearly eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the tom@@ bs of Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; until this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when one stands in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ oo@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and insp@@ ect the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children sit on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; mur@@ m@@ urs a little boy as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w hu@@ gs Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ oft embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks through him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that it is not in your heart .
you did it for a reason . &quot;
later the audience sat down with the actors for dinner .
at a table a white pair of Atlanta talks about the im@@ position with a black pair they just met .
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky fought to find words that felt the performance of the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that , because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching continues to go on , &quot; she added , &quot; today this is called only police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room Ty@@ rone holds Broo@@ ks courtyard at his table , he eats and reminds of citizens &apos; rights . &quot;
he said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .
&quot; the im@@ position is inspiring in a way , as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is like we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dä@@ mmerung &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bay@@ reuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf creates a colourful and fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story setting . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows a sh@@ aded street corner with Berlin Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ ste &quot; &quot; logo from the GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; in front of it par@@ ked an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhine mur@@ der@@ ers pos@@ ing as a rock ergi@@ r@@ l , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that moves through its &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhine beds - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke Leh@@ m@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise beautifully as in &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cess gives them Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , dis@@ integrate a cor@@ pse in the luggage compartment in Hollywood @-@ style and enter the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
&quot; Stephen M@@ illing sings the splen@@ did@@ ly nasty Hagen , which surrounds the aura of a heavy @-@ weight box . &quot;
brut@@ ally the scene when he strikes Siegfried .
&quot; later , Gun@@ ther ( Markus Eiche ) must also believe it . &quot;
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are enthusi@@ astically celebrated , who mo@@ dest@@ ly and de@@ fle@@ cted her hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in light of the high heat again in casual leisure clothing . &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; in 2013 , in 2013 , he had to let go of a grand piano conc@@ erto , five years later , in which the scattered &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; rep@@ ut@@ ations went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is likely to have looked forward to this .
&quot; it was noted that the audience had grown together with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the public not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it also grew an understanding of its view . &quot;
I prefer a positive resume .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in several places in their volunteer year .
where to everywhere ?
&quot; crowd : usually in Stein@@ furt , in the furniture fair , once a week I can help Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I also worked at the school in the open whole day .
what is your experience with it ?
&quot; it is a beautiful , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer . &quot;
how does that come about ?
amount : I have graduated from high school .
&quot; and then a civil engineering study , let &apos;s say , successfully demol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for me , I realized that it is the wrong thing for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked myself , what do you do . &quot;
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it really is on the spot , in the focal point maybe too . &quot;
and was it so ?
amount : I collected great impressions .
I will start my studies in the social sciences in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably in Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne do a social worker training and study at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different locations during the volunte@@ ering service ?
&quot; amount : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends where you are making your FS@@ J .
it can be done from the retirement home to youth work - in all possible facets of social work .
&quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot;
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
for me it was just the right thing that provoked me .
I was able to recognize my own strengths and see how it really works .
unlike civil engineering studies ?
&quot; well , it &apos;s not about calcul@@ ating st@@ atics . &quot;
&quot; one has always other people in front of the head , each of them having a completely different story behind them . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager who has been extracted from the family - you must always take care of it individually . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I &apos;m not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives a lot .
&quot; lots of love , much kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also negative moments , but life is the same . &quot;
&quot; Pear@@ son cuts additional 3,000 jobs and shor@@ tens the dividend to revi@@ ve the business &quot;
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that it will reduce further 3,000 jobs and cut its interim dividend by 72 percent as a further restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; in addition to its previous restructuring , the job cuts , which Director General John Fall@@ on announced for the most part for the end of 2018 and early 2019 , will be added in addition to its previous restructuring . &quot;
&quot; in May , in a third cost cutting program , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by a further 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the rapid step towards digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House last month to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the business year remained unchanged , after an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , the Afgh@@ an capital , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say civil servants . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter have been injured and announced a NATO Declaration .
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ a@@ h . &quot;
bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - more than 30 people were killed in a mos@@ que in Her@@ at on Tuesday .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people close to the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; NATO &apos;s opinion is that the explosion on Thursday night had occurred when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afgh@@ an army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are treated at the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ a@@ h , is a major concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , of which about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they executed this attack .
&quot; on May 31 , a massive bombing in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops suffered the Taliban from power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tr@@ ump wash@@ es up the number of U.S. troops supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that in Kab@@ ul , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings have caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policies , and especially the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f G@@ hani , in recent weeks . &quot;
EPA Ret@@ ur@@ ns Dec@@ ision to Del@@ ay Smo@@ g Ru@@ le after C@@ lay
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has rev@@ oked a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , which states that states are obliged to contain the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this took place one day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the step . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; o@@ zone regulations 2015 , &quot; and said it shows the agency &apos;s commitment to co @-@ operate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in the dialogue and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; &quot; said EPA head Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA in June , to determine the o@@ zone regulations , in which pollut@@ ant emissions should be measured in a part of the country , in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tr@@ ump has tried to drive back a wide range of environmental charges imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that , according to Tr@@ ump , aims to boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , the efforts have caused the set@@ back of the Democrats and conservation groups , which are concerned about the impact of major emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the EPA website says that inhal@@ ing air , containing o@@ zone &quot; &quot; reduces lung function and strengthens respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
community wants common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two opposing voices , the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ cles decides to set up a community room in the future sen@@ iors residence . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the still missing part of the land is signed , reports Mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will take some time for the area to be owned by the church community until now , there is no planning obstacle to the project stem@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion about a common room for this .
one of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the municipal council ho@@ vers to see such a common room as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the sen@@ i@@ anism @-@ just residential building , but openly in the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; kn@@ itting café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which was pre @-@ decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn , is made possible by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a community room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible for funding . &quot;
&quot; the proposal envis@@ ages to signal the investor that in this respect one does not want to throw a bil@@ let between the legs , stating that both the saddle - what is le@@ aning against the surrounding construction - as well as the pitch roof - which reduces the tear height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer is not referring to this additive . &quot;
if it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the committee .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many of her own buildings , with which one does not move so well , but now they lean into the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I am struggling with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger absolutely appeals to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to any asset or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the acquisition of the area there is no surplus , but I get a real equivalent value , in case of doubt , that is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
three advoc@@ ates are advoc@@ ated by the Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s request to submit the proposal .
&quot; that &apos;s how it stays with two opposing voices in the original programme that Stefan H@@ aller sums up : &quot; &quot; if we believe the decision , we make a giant leap into close a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with Auto : Rad@@ ler is thrown on the road
&quot; during the crossing of the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and severely injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police divided , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was travelling by bicycle on the road from the Schwar@@ zer way out of direction to Hil@@ den . &quot;
the Senior wanted to cross the road at the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver who is driving in the same direction allowed him to take preced@@ ence over him .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving on the road , he obviously did not pay attention to the traffic . &quot;
he met with a car that controlled a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hel@@ den@@ erin .
the man was thrown onto the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was transported to a hospital with a ret@@ ou@@ ling car .
FC Bayern Munich has to ab@@ stain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup will take place without him : David Al@@ aba will have to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with human resources , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first compulsory play of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the defending champion in the Super@@ cup against the tro@@ phy winner .
&quot; the sta@@ ff@@ ers at the German soccer world record champion Bayern München are getting bigger in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger , Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti should refrain from using the B@@ V@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
this was confirmed by the Italian on Friday .
&quot; the mou@@ th@@ pieces Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben und Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti has bl@@ amed the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , that was not good at last . &quot;
but the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official compulsory game of the season .
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
&quot; the game was sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the resin of star to star , hiking &quot;
&quot; in the Harz , the first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to be created . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Stern@@ warte St. Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; &quot; ( Stern@@ warte St. Andre@@ as@@ berg ) is planned . &quot;
there is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .
a &quot; star path &quot; accommod@@ ates the information needs of many har@@ z@@ ards .
&quot; it unites nature , science , movement and athletic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase by 2018 , the association is planning &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; I would ask St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Si@@ eber . &quot;
the information on the tables is to be supplemented by Internet .
&quot; for this reason , a good mobile network reception is a part of the site selection . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the train will be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star@@ base , the viewer experiences a lot of interesting facts , for example on the physics of the individual stars , &quot; &quot; explained the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars would have different colors , or why a star appeared more light than another , even though it was far further away . &quot;
&quot; it also teaches , in which con@@ stellation is a selected star and when it is best to be seen . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association operates the highest located observ@@ atory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Go@@ ett@@ ingen , there is something similar to the Plan@@ etary Trail on the initiative of the Planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planet carries its stel@@ a@@ es up to the Ha@@ in@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( community of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ a@@ es with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to gra@@ ded to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned at the exact distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun is exactly 75 meters away at least 70 centimet@@ ers away . &quot;
the total distance of the planet is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from sun to Plu@@ to needs about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour up to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
so pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos .
but the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ ko meet for the first time to discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course in order to stage the most exciting battle in the near future under 147 l@@ bs , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council Light@@ weight Champion , went down the corridor to greet Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organization super @-@ Feder@@ weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous vote on the former Four @-@ Di@@ visi@@ oned World Champion , Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the top five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia put out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
&quot; I wish you a lot of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 PM on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noted that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order of magnitude . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m a former heav@@ y@@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia recalls . &quot;
&quot; I climbed for Bronze &#91; at 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to get down to lightweight .
and he has to move to light wei@@ ghted people &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
this is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ ko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked whether it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 dollar debut this year to agree on the fight against the winner of Jor@@ ge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell following their lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23rd . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode , because all the fans have asked him , &quot; Gar@@ cia told , and later expressed openly about fighting on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
Gar@@ cia said he value Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle .
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ ko stayed with the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said that he thinks the &quot; &quot; Tri@@ athlon Champion Stal@@ lion from Ri@@ ver@@ side &quot; &quot; looks very slow , I &apos;m sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show head@@ strong points , then boxes . &quot;
they both said that they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; I &apos;ve been waiting for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great battle . &quot;
four de@@ moun@@ ts to T@@ ire Plat@@ ter
&quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were injured in part severely on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after initial information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control of his vehicle shortly before the end of the market at 16.@@ 30 hrs . &quot;
&quot; the car sli@@ pped to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he over@@ turned and then lay on the roof of the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four in@@ mates - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the first supply of the injured by the ambul@@ ance service the A@@ 7 was locked in the direction of the north for about an hour , afterwards the traffic on the left side of the road could be passed by at the accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; the three @-@ chain works better &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener on Braunschweig , Andr@@ e Hoffmann hopes that optim@@ ising the def@@ ences in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first round of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was happy , with the result also if there weren &apos;t the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player from Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the chain of the three @-@ chain should be further optimized . &quot;
and one goal after a free@@ blow is not to catch the For@@ tun@@ as any more .
&quot; for the future , it will be that no more besides Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) will focus on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better with the three @-@ chain teams even after the experience in preparation with the three @-@ chain .
&quot; I don &apos;t know how to act in au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; &quot; because we have just in the three @-@ chain at the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann , who can build good , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we harmon@@ ize even better and we don &apos;t make so many mistakes in the setup . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann is going to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; however , whether one can speak after a draw from a failed start , does not know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; but if we stand on Sunday with four points and can focus on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to speak of a regular season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about that .
&quot; I do not judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of play , &quot; Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el said , who would not want to talk about an advantage compared to Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be stopped early due to a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 % where they are at the moment , &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot;
the guests from the Rhin@@ eland leave the Rhin@@ eland as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e .
&quot; that we sweep them away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six , is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose record is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s executive coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ age application tests published
recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden submitted to a new method for medical evaluation of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .
the Swedish authority for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) commen@@ ced the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the app@@ rais@@ al of the age after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; to date , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 cases to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older but in another 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; perhaps 18 years or older . &quot;
in 4@@ 32 cases the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years of age .
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson from For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results over the past months are steady . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in statistics of the past months , the figures are fairly constant , &quot; he said of The Local . &quot;
the high percentage of cases in which the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers have lied about their age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there are 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka Dag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 results , she found out that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in which x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by denti@@ sts and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work encompasses the app@@ rais@@ al of the biological ri@@ pen@@ ess of humans to see if they usually went through pu@@ ber@@ ty sooner or later . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
assessing biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson of For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk of finding a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is , if the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
packed in the plan
the works on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton@@ ne concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it runs great , &quot; &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , forem@@ an at the Department of Road and Traffic in the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Pres@@ i@@ dency of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the works began at the same time on all three areas requiring renovation between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Light is sure that the schedule will be respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red coloured ribbon and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the other two bridges , it has come into the years . &quot;
&quot; to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly rehabil@@ itated . &quot;
the other two bridges lead through the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach on the north side has received a so @-@ called bridge cap on the north side . &quot;
this is a marginal fixing which is also used as an operating system .
&quot; on Friday , a 2,@@ 20 @-@ metre @-@ wide bridge deck is to be used on the southern part of the bridge . &quot;
then the pedestrian walk@@ way will proceed .
&quot; the special thing about this is that it is manufacturing parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges have already been fitted with the patented bridge caps .
a special feeling of t@@ act has required the laying of lines through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable to which many companies are connected .
the residents were informed about the project in advance of their work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans had to be f@@ ished off . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard building and the her@@ mitage in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is one lane regulated by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the &quot; &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; &quot; is completely closed . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the three sets of bridges tot@@ als 700@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
the whole thing is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : under protest with German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties can pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which would otherwise be difficult to reconci@@ le . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the chal@@ k day ( CD@@ U , SPD , Gre@@ ens , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance , which is peaceful in this day , because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stad@@ thalle is inviting R@@ ond@@ ell to the loud &quot; &quot; great campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and conf@@ essed names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land forms the top duo for the parliamentary election on September 24 , and the deputy chairman Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on the spot already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ promis@@ ers , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Ei@@ fel remains colourful . &quot;
&quot; originally the town @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; &quot; All at one table &quot; &quot; on the fountain place , but now takes place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stad@@ thalle . &quot;
a colourful picture that offers itself .
&quot; what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum A world and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; German potato salad , which the Af@@ D could eat without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ her@@ pes of the Af@@ D Vol@@ can@@ ic Ei@@ fel report that he dedicated himself to such an event and got the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked for Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us@@ kir@@ n there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; well , the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ me is glad that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; looking at the event on the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ platz , he says : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; there is also a band for entertainment at 8 o &apos;clock in the ond@@ ell@@ platz square , and there are several speakers in the Stad@@ thalle , among them the rh@@ ein@@ land @-@ pf@@ äl@@ z@@ ische Af@@ D @-@ chair@@ woman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; there are about 200 listeners in the hall waiting for the top candidate for the parliamentary election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the deputy chairman of the Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch to speak their speeches . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remains unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; the Af@@ D @-@ event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police cannot move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Poz@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli can be found in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Kloster@@ Concer@@ tos tomorrow , Sunday , at 8@@ pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Bal@@ kan@@ folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held point positions in European premi@@ er orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov solo trump@@ eter at the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo trumpet player of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire not only to exceed the boundaries on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz pianist N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical music , jazz and free play merge into a fascinating total art work . &quot;
this cent@@ er@@ piece of the program was first performed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram wrote it specifically for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its particular acousti@@ cs became consciously included in the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheeses and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; says Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart on her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the best @-@ known relationship between Hollywood stars was the &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague , Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt very bitter@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin ass@@ ures against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was seriously fallen in love with each I &apos;ve ever recorded . &quot;
or do you think I played it ?
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived and believed du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never interfer@@ ed or hin@@ dered me .
I never liked to be taken seriously .
&quot; she especially suffered from &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z , &quot; but at school time she preferred to dress like a boy : &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
that really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me that I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and humili@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girls , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , they do not like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to react to a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself from the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a demonstration with President Tr@@ ump that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the democr@@ ats have removed from me , &quot; Gover@@ nor Justice said . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of reflection ... today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the demonstration broke out in Ju@@ bel .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr. Tr@@ ump promised beforehand a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tr@@ ump won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; justice , according to For@@ bes , is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he owns coal mines in five states and has inherited a coal merchant from his father .
it is worth approximately $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Repub@@ lican National Committee issued an explanation in which it said : &quot; &quot; the change of the party of Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party which would prevent us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party that is from top to bottom without leadership and is not able to find a positive , convincing message , &quot; &quot; said the C@@ BS News leader , Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian excuse for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal@@ ous
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia to a dop@@ ing scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed in the sport . &quot;
&quot; Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF congress on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships , that the exile of his country was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all the athletes , who were gra@@ bbed gold and silver med@@ als at competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e the re@@ porter . &quot;
&quot; the entire Council and the Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised that it has experienced some fairly hot times , and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed . &quot;
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; delighted &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re@@ introduction .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the Task Force recommendations that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the de@@ pra@@ ved system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships , which commen@@ ce on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF task force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still meet some of the criteria for re@@ setting . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; he said in London after a speech at the IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
&quot; act of mourning for soldiers cut off in Mali , &quot;
&quot; at a funeral service in the northern h@@ ess@@ ischen Frit@@ z@@ lar , approximately 1000 people of the two had thought about a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing about the un@@ solved crash .
&quot; they called the two young pilots , however , as &quot; pat@@ rons of their profession . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow to the highest sacrifice they have made in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen died on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
her coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr into the deep fr@@ yer Cathedral of Saint Peter on Thursday .
&quot; at noon , only relatives in the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; then the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr , as well as politics . &quot;
among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; the branches laid down roses , the relatives stood arm in arm on the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen described the fallen soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and inhal@@ ed .
the Stab@@ s@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the flight operation of the combat helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ er@@ sa@@ ch , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belonged , explained : &quot; if this occupation could not turn off the crash , no one would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; in Mali , there were no doubts about the UN Mission in Mali : the use was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but it is also of great importance &quot; for a country of which we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they were buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not give any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the husband of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that divided the Royal House on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried at the Ros@@ kil@@ de Cathedral Church . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ g@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
&quot; the Queen was in agreement with her husband &apos;s decision , she said further in the message . &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also dis@@ covers the title &quot; &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik did not get the title and the function he wanted , he did not see himself equal to his wife - even after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will ultimately be , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cratic family . &quot;
he worked on the Th@@ ames in the French Embassy .
&quot; during his later wife &apos;s sympath@@ ies of the people , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing at the Dan@@ es in his barely 50 years old rule . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critici@@ zed . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk so@@ cks instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises that I smoked in place of Virginia Tob@@ acco and who had a reputation in this country to be the brand of social intellectuals , I could not hope for len@@ i@@ ency . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed happy with this position and didn &apos;t feel ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a quick re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in front of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority , Lower Saxony &apos;s Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is not willing to res@@ ign for a quick re @-@ election of the country . &quot;
that said on Friday for the dissolution of the parliament .
&quot; previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Party member from its Sunday faction in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the Sunday elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ jackets , former Green Party member , founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in its constitu@@ ency circle in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) . &quot;
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she explained on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U S &amp; D Group President Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his Group to include them .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Parliament , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens 68 seats . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the relationship has been revers@@ ed . &quot;
the new Land@@ tag is scheduled to become regular on 14 January next year .
&quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler , the red @-@ green provincial government must now decide whether they can continue to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as quickly as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the Constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility of the Land@@ tag to withdraw trust and elect a successor to the Prime Minister .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution provides several options . &quot;
&quot; these options must be legally clean , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
one will calm@@ ly discuss all the questions if they are legally assessed judi@@ ci@@ ally .
&quot; Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called &quot; &quot; T@@ west@@ ens Step &quot; &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a follow@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called on the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their country@@ men .
&quot; we assume , of course , that they return their land retreat , which they have received via the green country list , with immediate effect &quot; , &quot; said the Chairman of the State Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel : &quot; &quot; we greatly regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ ester . &quot;
she consciously decided not to express any pron@@ unciation in the faction .
&quot; even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . &quot;
&quot; the SPD chan@@ cell@@ or candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the over@@ step of the Lower Saxony Green Party , El@@ ke T@@ jackets , to the CD@@ U as treas@@ on . &quot;
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green Party members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the head of the Federal Social Democrats on Facebook on Friday . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
leaving T@@ west@@ ens costs red @-@ green in Lower Saxony the majority .
&quot; the politicians in their past vanity and fru@@ stration were their personal interests in the interests of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a scandal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony has taken this dirty in@@ filtration and tries to make political capital out of it .
Dutch CD@@ U president Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to add El@@ ke T@@ jackets to the CD@@ U .
&quot; group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , accused T@@ west of fal@@ si@@ fying the outcome of the 2013 Parliament election with personal career aspir@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; at that time the CD@@ U was the strongest force in front of the SPD , the SPD and the Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority of one vote in the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in Interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the scandal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) Spe@@ ech and Ans@@ wer .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check stamp printing .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ star@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states present the latest information on the affected eggs bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all , what we are currently aware of , health hazards are practically impossible . &quot;
is Al@@ di now taking over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has been shut down immediately and has since become aware of the const@@ ern@@ ation of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available to consumers .
&quot; as well as the manufacturers , trade has to ensure that the products sold are able to transport and are harmless to health . &quot;
&quot; if eggs are exceeded at 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg , they are not capable of transport . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ poll@@ uted eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time not the factories are to blame .
are manufacturing plants and consumers sitting in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the state of knowledge , production plants do not have an immediate fault . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must expect economic damages due to the presum@@ ed illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are too few controllers in the harvest . &quot;
is it lacking only on the staff or in the conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that revealed the process .
&quot; the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out as 100 per cent . &quot;
it is precisely for this reason that a consistent explanation of such events and the transfer to the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in the cases in which criminal off@@ ences may be present are of decisive importance .
I have already made it clear that I expect a complete education from the responsible authorities .
is peri@@ odic al@@ er@@ mis@@ m really necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and traffic @-@ free foods .
&quot; if an un@@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are justified . &quot;
&quot; the pan@@ de@@ mic means manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; in general , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the position of food @-@ borne animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
&quot; at all levels , it is necessary to work consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
I expect from all relevant authorities that the facts are solved quickly and comprehen@@ sively .
how the football rules of football affect N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from Barcelona to French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will come for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the guiding organization that supervis@@ es the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair @-@ Play rules , launched in 2011 by UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G has to prove at some point that the transfer of N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( € 26@@ 2 million ) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
PS@@ G can easily make the money loose for N@@ ey@@ mar to sign and bring him into a gal@@ axy of other stars in view of the financing of the team by the energy rich royal family of Qatar .
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players , but have to counter@@ balance with legitimate revenue sources , which allow them to break even point in their game related to football . &quot;
&quot; FF@@ P was conceived by Michel Plat@@ ini , following his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 . &quot;
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively che@@ at and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdraw their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of its losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , which was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to be a harder issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current annual FF@@ P publishing period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of € 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini fell into dis@@ favour in 2015 by the presi@@ dency , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , continues to sc@@ are off excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G has paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for invo@@ icing over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the selling price for the next five years amoun@@ ting to 4@@ 4.4 million euros can be reported in the financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( then 82 million dollars ) , which was lowered to 20 million euros later - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs , which could try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their income through companies associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a kat@@ ar@@ isches undertaking could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of the sponsor@@ ship exceeds the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEF@@ A decided that the P@@ SA sponsor@@ ship was boo@@ sted by the Qatar Tourism Authority . &quot;
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments could come to N@@ ey@@ mar by payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have argued that N@@ ey@@ mar WM will become am@@ bass@@ adors and that such manoeu@@ v@@ res for the UEF@@ A regulatory authorities could be easy to find out .
&quot; the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive , to ignore any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G via N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s transfer , on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press since they were not competent to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of 54@@ 2.4 million euros .
accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ship deals , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales . &quot;
the association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing in .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of the league , Ja@@ vier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar &apos;s last ownership to PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose club is owned by an American sports @-@ ty@@ co@@ on , divi@@ des the reservations from La League to a state owned by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and this has changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair play , because you can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new sho@@ oter supplier
&quot; over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y Bord @-@ Cho@@ colate has produced chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
now the sweet cooperation is at a possible end : the airline is writing the contract anew .
&quot; at the request of the news agency , Swiss @-@ spokesperson Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; on Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; each year , approximately 17 million small red @-@ white packed sho@@ cks of 14 grams distribute the flight atten@@ d@@ ants before landing to the passengers . &quot;
Swiss didn &apos;t want to provide any information about the cost .
industry insi@@ ders estimate the order volume in &quot; Nor@@ thwest Switzerland &quot; to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary generates annual sales of about one billion Swiss francs .
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a sho@@ oter manufacturer .
Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants find it in the new tender .
&quot; however , there are only Swiss manufacturers in question . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y will try to renew the contract over the spring 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the largest chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement . &quot;
&quot; since 2006 , Swiss has distributed chocolate panels on board their flights . &quot;
&quot; before the Swiss concluded a contract with Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut shipped the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hu@@ g . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is nostal@@ gic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the pioneers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch @-@ comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to bigger things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era permanent memories .
&quot; but as fran@@ chise , it feels like time is scar@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not just because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a promising pose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool kids , who will grow up - nevertheless they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; years L@@ ater &quot; , &quot; with its adults who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more according to the principle of watering , including a reef on the Stal@@ ker films of the 90 @-@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand which ga@@ thers the cra@@ dle &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; one point rum@@ bles a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some Inline Sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the ami@@ able C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ gu@@ er@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Mar@@ ino ) has still not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another crazy evil plot that Ron@@ ald Re@@ ag@@ an ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) is involved , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the ex@@ courses are the best part of fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos; mou@@ sta@@ che &apos; Sing@@ les &apos; , whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old cra@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; it is the moments of random ma@@ dness that could fuel this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he reaches that which I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band the film premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its east @-@ east@@ ward @-@ west w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Aless@@ andro Tan@@ aka is to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the way of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i whose di@@ alo@@ gues of Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt will be synchron@@ ized to English .
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice tags to look at ( the police sp@@ ends the time watching chess on television as Americans might do football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ ha Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent play &apos; Find out the voice &apos; . &quot;
&quot; but Com@@ rade Det@@ ective is very committed to the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ ag@@ an mask , is involved - that it often plays like a single . &quot;
&quot; with six long episodes , it pul@@ ls away , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was edited on a lower length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re because Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that the Western culture can make everything a food for a ban@@ quet .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and theirs .
strike against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in hitting the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Kon@@ stanz , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office was r@@ ushed on Friday . &quot;
15 respon@@ dents were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
&quot; in addition , officials also secured larger quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in the case of simultaneous ra@@ ids in Italy , two people were arrested . &quot;
against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans there were German arrest warran@@ ts .
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian agents were involved in the campaign .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were deployed . &quot;
&quot; members of the Ma@@ fia are accused of organised crime crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating Con@@ stance against organised drug trade in Southern Germany . &quot;
between the public prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Con@@ stance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , on Wednesday morning , the large deployment was accompanied by four Palermo officials . &quot;
the aim of the investigation was mainly Italian nationals with closely related to the Italian Ma@@ fia .
&quot; an incident on May 27 at Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired in a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
wise lam@@ ents large gaps in the alien register
&quot; according to a report , the for@@ eigner &apos;s register in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Affairs of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to a media report on large gaps in the immigration centre register . &quot;
&quot; in the case of asylum procedures and de@@ port@@ ations , short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there may lead to some serious mis@@ decisions , in a manner in which the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; exists . &quot;
&quot; according to data , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the register , including approximately 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the data is administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany . &quot;
&quot; because the data has not been adequately maintained , the data quality in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data were found in 1921 , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; er@@ ron@@ eous data input can slow down revers@@ al processes considerably , &quot; &quot; the report continues . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of sufficient people , moreover , EU citizens are included who do not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; such false orders , however , led &quot; to a distorted debate on how to deal with exp@@ atri@@ ates , &quot; it means in the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the German government apparently started sending refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they arrived from there . &quot;
&quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rü@@ cker Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in paper , it is said that BA@@ MF is conducting such procedures &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was practically no longer possible , as the paper was referring to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin Agreement , the EU state is responsible for refugees . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant continues to travel to another EU country , this state can send it back to the immigration country . &quot;
&quot; the ministry is now writing : &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially . &quot;
Italy gave guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there in the context of the Dublin Agreement .
&quot; the domestic political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing faction in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children threaten un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
a total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided blood donation service to other people .
at least of the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday .
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who is now sharing 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations . &quot;
traditionally the congregation acknowled@@ ges in the meeting of the Council the multiple willingness to don@@ ate blood .
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our bodies are designed for this , and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors that make their blood available to foreigners , not sel@@ fl@@ ess , &quot; emphas@@ ised Mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the Regional Head of the German Red Cross ( DR@@ K ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , for the c@@ anned foods are broken down into their constitu@@ ents . &quot;
three people could benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , Mais@@ enb@@ acher reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the DR@@ K Regional Sales Manager . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the change in the theater was led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ Blu@@ eber@@ ry were among the multiple don@@ ors and received 50 donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger book half so many , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stefanie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter spent ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after the weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase . &quot;
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure .
&quot; the political decision @-@ makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates down to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members going to increase in this month as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % and by 2018 at 1.6 % and warned that the pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in autumn . &quot;
but she sign@@ alized that interest increases would be necessary in the coming years to re@@ strain the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that bor@@ rowing costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .
members also agreed to withdraw a portion of the mam@@ mot@@ h stimulus package issued a year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will call for time for financing plan to provide cheaper funds for banks as of February , although it was said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak at short notice , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption . &quot;
&quot; in the interest rates , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be required to cool inflation and a &quot; slightly larger scale &quot; than the markets expected . &quot;
the markets are currently forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank pointed out that increases were &quot; gradual &quot; and &quot; limited . &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts revised upwards for this and next year are 1.9 % and 1.7 % compared to the expected in May .
it has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell to these news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound fell by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ appo@@ inting growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations on interest income , and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the preceding three months increased to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth is expected to lie at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report provides little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and slight salary increases , as the tigh@@ tening of inflation becomes worse before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot &quot; prevent income &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts are &quot; clearly &quot; to recover . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also boo@@ sted by the rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the fall of the spark . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s last ruling on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three policy makers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation decreased from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said it was expected and will tigh@@ ten it in the coming months . &quot;
the bank said that the over@@ write in relation to its target of 2 % was &quot; wholly &quot; attributable to the weak Po@@ und .
&quot; Mr Mont@@ br@@ ate , Director of Cor@@ eco Mor@@ t@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent decline in Swa@@ p rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to be more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors would rather search for businesses and want to finish the year in a positive manner . &quot;
&quot; the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages conclude , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be 10,000 people controversial HIV drug &quot;
&quot; patients will receive access to a &quot; &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; &quot; HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the High Court against financing the drug in N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS England admitted that a preventive maintenance pro@@ phy@@ lac@@ tic ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , after which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the alle@@ gation that the local authorities were supposed to finance him . &quot;
&quot; the chess move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England boss Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; &quot; while the National Aids Trust ( NA@@ T ) designated this as the &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to allow the registration of people , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 in all England . &quot;
pre@@ diction pro@@ phyla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection risk .
taking pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .
such medicines may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; appropriate candidates are identified in clinics that agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual health clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to deliver the medicines this week following an international competitive purchase .
&quot; the study aims to assess the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting clinical evidence , as it is targeted , taken up and implemented on a large scale . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV . &quot;
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National Aids Trust ) , said : &quot; &quot; this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , when targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , Chief Executive Officer of Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot;
&quot; now , as the pre@@ p test medicine is procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , shadow minister , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delay and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation through the government . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to the eradic@@ ation of HIV in society . &quot;
living Big Life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Ear@@ ls Court flat into a generous home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , shr@@ ank in 2014 from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment . &quot;
it is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much larger room , &quot; &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I was looking for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and she had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot apartment was completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ bedroom property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12@@ ,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand . &quot;
he had to think cre@@ atively in order to resolve the issue .
&quot; the steel work is quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend .
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the glam@@ orous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of yo@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a glam@@ orous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
folding kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering art went in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan from the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is counter@@ productive so that when you push the door , it sli@@ ps very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne was able to gain an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property will be appreciated , &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the floor size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things you touch and can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; Er@@ fan says . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t fall into electrical sockets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can turn out to be something amazing by a good design and an increased square meter number of something standard .
&quot; indeed , like Jo@@ anne , you might decide not to leave these . &quot;
brothers struggling for a $ 500 million property empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate imperialist Victori@@ as worth over $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the Carl@@ ton Football Club and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a store at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis &apos;s portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her de@@ ceased father , Col@@ in - by Paul described as &quot; &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one third . &quot;
a court file states that this means that Col@@ in owned property amoun@@ ting to $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million .
the distribution of properties and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the app@@ rais@@ als proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business , of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , have ruled out . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but th@@ rows Paul to manage some property in@@ compet@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; in an early aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with affir@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , e @-@ mails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held law firms . &quot;
Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her de@@ ceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen stores from the late 1950 &apos;s and in the early se@@ ven@@ ties bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick .
&quot; they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ans@@ Shop of the family . &quot;
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was the High School in my last years when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on her property to her sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis Group , where Col@@ in claims that Mark had paid $ 10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; Luke , as well as Mark , have become bitter about the conditions of their financial division . &quot;
Col@@ in with@@ held himself very much even though he was a former AF@@ L member and after a biography from 2015 Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire was the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in responded by SMS to say &apos; I really can &apos;t say much &apos; because the case is in front of the courts .
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our sur@@ name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute , &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; still hoping for a solution . &quot; &quot;
on Friday this hope seemed to be over .
&quot; our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future , &quot; Col@@ in wrote . &quot;
Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the President &apos;s media ab@@ st@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tr@@ ump , including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Tr@@ ump@@ ur &apos;s White House , which he wanted to fix : bad information that comes into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly told employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
&quot; Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to t@@ ame Tr@@ ump by monitoring his media diet . &quot;
&quot; President Tr@@ ump Rel@@ ation@@ ship to television reaches decades ago - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if Tr@@ ump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince , &quot; said the former campaign consultant Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February against Politi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; at the time , Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote that &quot; the key to control Tr@@ ump &apos;s Twitter habit , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s Twitter custom was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know yet - that Tr@@ ump T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more fuel without their interventions .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tr@@ ump has not sent .
&quot; if his co @-@ workers managed to keep anger from him a number of times , then their efforts paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented Tr@@ ump &apos;s controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Tr@@ ump material that may promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advis@@ ers , to give the president for strategic reasons du@@ bi@@ ous information . &quot;
this was an example described by re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tr@@ ump officials say that Tr@@ ump , like a volcano can react to negative press cuts , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he tries to find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ciously delivered a printed copy of an article from Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh to &quot; &quot; be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; even though Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for har@@ ass@@ ment , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence , or that he has utter@@ ed false accus@@ ations in the past and has rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tr@@ ump reading the article and began asking staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the then Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work that Tr@@ ump receives . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tr@@ ump is still his im@@ pul@@ sive self , and his consultants are still striving for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys Mission very difficult .
most wanted criminals get mail from Euro@@ pol
&quot; since the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped for . &quot;
&quot; in this summer ( virtual ) postcards , the police all over Europe send postcards to dangerous criminals . &quot;
&quot; since the addresses of the searched s@@ words are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped for and asked for . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol reported on the action that follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; Advent calendar from winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many refugees hide themselves from holiday destinations , which was said by the Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have compiled 21 postcards for searched criminals from 21 EU countries .
since 2016 the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times .
&quot; 36 of the online search@@ ings could be arrested so far , at least 11 of them due to evidence after the publication on the website . &quot;
&quot; travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire &apos;s series &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some resol@@ ute travelers on the feet , who tra@@ ded a tren@@ ch drawn by the municipality to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ ors . &quot;
the travellers have par@@ ked their 20 carav@@ ans on a field outside of a well @-@ to @-@ do street of Soli@@ hull that is called the Million@@ aire &apos;s series .
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were first thrown out in May , without being deter@@ red by a dit@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in defense posts and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry inhabitants urged the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; they moved there on Monday evening after they were sent on by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must , by shame , be forced into action , since he was useless in dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travelers were there in May , moved on and are back now . &quot;
&quot; more arrived last night , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added , &quot; The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I &apos;m not happy to continue to pay my local charge , if the Council cannot stop it . &quot;
&quot; a local who didn &apos;t want to be called , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
the numbers have increased this time and you even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Soli@@ hull Council said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp in the country beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and cooperate with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps to enable them to move on as quickly as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible inform the police as many residents as possible by calling 101 . &quot;
&quot; this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court has to examine , when we present our case . &quot;
from Bir@@ k@@ enhof is Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is taken from the former hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freu@@ den@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the former ambience of operating company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13th , 2014 approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered to the Regional Office as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers from the establishment of a land plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the municipal council . &quot;
but above all Freu@@ den@@ stadt &apos;s Mayor Julian O@@ ss@@ wald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious people interested in the house at that time .
he was supposed to keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ ot@@ els with managing director Bir@@ git Sch@@ erer with registered office in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freu@@ den@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; they are called Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear how extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors have been torn out , ceilings are partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single construction site .
there is still much to do by March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; later on , everything should become &quot; &quot; pretty civil &quot; &quot; as Thomas Sch@@ erer is expressing . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and conference room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; one does not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an elevated inner city level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its about 60 rooms , wants to spread broad@@ ly , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual travelers , groups or business people should feel comfortable at the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian O@@ ss@@ wald and tourist director Michael Kr@@ ause , says Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the performances of the city are identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to pin@@ point exactly the amount of investment required .
&quot; just under a million euros , he calcul@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; the exterior installations are also brought forward , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which is open to the restaurant , which is public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freu@@ den@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Inves@@ tig@@ ator sets up Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Tr@@ ump , Special promot@@ er Robert Mu@@ eller should have appointed a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; the panel has taken up work over the past few weeks , wrote the Wall Street Journal , calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified its investigations .
the CN@@ N broad@@ caster reports that there are already first shipments of the committee in connection with a meeting between the Tr@@ ump of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. intelligence agencies have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time interfer@@ ing in the 2016 presidential campaign .
Mu@@ eller examined whether there were agreements between the Tr@@ ump Contest team and Moscow .
the investigations focus on several men who were active in the election campaign as advis@@ er to the re@@ public@@ ans .
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller also examined more and more tr@@ umps private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Washington Post &quot; &quot; wrote several weeks ago that the Sonder@@ er@@ emit@@ ter Tr@@ ump personally ind@@ wells the centre and investigate whether the president may have hin@@ dered the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand Jur@@ ys is to examine the evidence in possible crime incidents and to decide whether to charge a charge .
&quot; therefore , Grand Jur@@ ys are also called the defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the process is always carried out behind closed doors .
the body can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor in order to invite persons to be interro@@ gated under oath .
&quot; according to CN@@ N , invitations were issued which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tr@@ ump J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
people who were involved in the meeting were sum@@ mon@@ ed to testify that it was stated in the report .
they should also provide documents .
&quot; in addition to Tr@@ ump J@@ r. , Tr@@ ump@@ et &apos;s advis@@ ers and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner and his former election campaign chief Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were there . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the introduction showed that Mu@@ eller would not be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that if necessary he would act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the release of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; Russia &apos;s history is a total invention , &quot; Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
&quot; the topic gives the Democrats an opportunity to &quot; feel good , &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
his special advis@@ er T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
&quot; however , this work usually works in secret , he stressed . &quot;
&quot; the White House endor@@ ses any measures that ha@@ sten the work of the special agent in a &quot; &quot; fair &quot; &quot; way . &quot;
former FBI chief James Com@@ ey told three times that he was not going to be determined against the president .
&quot; I have no reason to assume that something has changed , it was stated in the statement . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tr@@ ump Com@@ ey had fired .
&quot; because of this withdrawal , accus@@ ations against Tr@@ ump were loud , he did not want to hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in June , Com@@ ey testified before a Senate Committee , Tr@@ ump asked him to set up an investigation against the national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees . &quot;
this triggered spec@@ ulations about whether Tr@@ ump Mu@@ eller was going to dis@@ miss .
&quot; unlike an independent promot@@ er of the Congress , such as in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair surrounding the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the urge of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; two groups of Repub@@ lican and Democratic Sen@@ ators presented legislation on Thursday , after which the Special Agent could no longer be dismissed . &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the Western Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg has been solved by the seven @-@ fold size of Berlin from the shelf . &quot;
this was confirmed by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sal piston , weighing over a tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres , is now driving north and will probably take two or three years until it melted . &quot;
&quot; with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice gi@@ ants that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger for human beings .
the extent to which climate change played a role in the demo@@ lition of the ic@@ e@@ berg is unclear according to research data .
&quot; all in all , however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ downs in the region for about 30 years , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( N@@ SI@@ DC ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has been a part of Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s so far .
Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
it continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xing and ab@@ ort was disturbed a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; an entire ice shelf is broken down there , writes A@@ WI research scientist Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is some evidence that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ pillar is in danger , as the front edge has never rec@@ eded as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice sheet stands under tension and can dis@@ integrate if a piece breaks off at a key point . &quot;
&quot; the melting of Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level , as they float on the water and squee@@ ze as much water as it results after the melting itself . &quot;
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ cow@@ s is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antar@@ cti@@ ca with almost 50,000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks off regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of the British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; according to his colleague , Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man , his colleague , Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man , said : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even though these researchers do not lead to climate change , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has fallen into ruins in recent decades . &quot;
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic extends towards South America .
&quot; according to the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s . &quot;
the rise in temperature contributed to the decline .
&quot; over the past 50 years , the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med around three degrees and is thus one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants skin sc@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U calls for the employer to step out of the employers &apos; association in order to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only shortly before the summer break , the working day of the county has reached 41 new places in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 staff and civil servants work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have their first working day behind them . &quot;
the teachers in the circle are obviously very much sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year .
&quot; however , the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 vac@@ ancies at the M@@ ett@@ mann county . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the parties &apos; desire , the administration should develop a concept for recru@@ iting personnel and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to meet not only short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented candidate shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should ori@@ ent itself in@@ wards and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entry and include a training offensive , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
that sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you did not know before .
other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms .
&quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who are leaving the ministry for disease or age reasons . &quot;
&quot; thus , the highest time for action so that no more places remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Völker , group leader of the CD@@ U , will go beyond the joint motion with his party . &quot;
&quot; he was already in the working day for a big surprise , when he publicly questioned the number of personnel and the other parties start@@ led . &quot;
people want all possibilities to be verified that enable a withdrawal from the municipal employers &apos; association .
&quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities - should strive for a house @-@ tari@@ ff , &quot; &quot; says peoples . &quot;
this means that the CD@@ U tries to pay better to the cler@@ ks and officials than it actually sees the tari@@ ff for the public service .
&quot; sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , raises or more money is only when one changes to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees are concerned with the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Regulation Act . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter solved a problem : they have too few staff . &quot;
Italy intensi@@ fies the tone on rescue @-@ migrants &apos; rescue boats
Italy has warned NGOs that deploy infl@@ atable boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations .
&quot; when NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; &quot; said interior minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis War@@ ning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat from the German aid organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew had worked together effectively with human traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the relief organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on the extensive alle@@ gations of the Italian prosec@@ utor Am@@ bro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; for us , the salvation of human life is our top priority . so we are very sorry we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; &quot; said the organization in a statement on the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only judge any accus@@ ations that are currently being collected , after collecting all the information and assessing the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had rescu@@ ed the boat from &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants on board , which are supplied directly by human traffi@@ ckers , and that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go off so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least such an encounter occurred only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s file whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected of viol@@ ating the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons , and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , boats like the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to stick to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring any &quot; &quot; substantial changes or disabilities &quot; &quot; of their ba@@ il@@ out actions . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , Nobel Prize winner organization is Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , Minn@@ iti has said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guards and cooperation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine women bi@@ kers , the &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and si@@ ght@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
three friendly guides were available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est from Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour conducted hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far above the Pal@@ at@@ inate Forest and the aforementioned levels . &quot;
&quot; in between there were repeat@@ ed@@ ely long climbs , for the long tri@@ als rewarded . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and the folk festival Wur@@ st@@ markt .
&quot; again , there was a look@@ out spot at the look@@ out point , connected by &quot; flew &quot; Tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; on the last two days , many al@@ timet@@ ers were announced again . &quot;
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and huts brought welcome break . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed sal@@ ine br@@ ine in the open @-@ air tank . &quot;
Neu@@ stadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga is avi@@ d for e @-@ sport
are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium fur@@ s when it comes to wind and weather ?
&quot; fact is : e @-@ Sport has long since become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business , including big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees . &quot;
&quot; these have also recognised the first federal states , which are increasingly involved in this field . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and recently the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports department in mid @-@ July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
it is certain that several clubs arise on this train .
&quot; next weekend , the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first &quot; Inter@@ active Club World Cup &quot; in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven also qualified . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ coach of Bayer L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en and Wer@@ der Bremen is now an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; real football has to deal with the 14 @-@ 30 @-@ year @-@ olds in particular , that young people will go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 year old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs were trying to conquer all possible markets , especially Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent E @-@ athletes under contract , you could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundes@@ liga to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even the FIFA World Cup are cont@@ ested at a competitive level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , le@@ agues have long since established , in which the pros race against each other . &quot;
&quot; and for the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is safe to get used to . &quot;
also In@@ go F@@ rob@@ bing has long been dealing with the question .
&quot; for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne , e @-@ sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses that can be found in classic sports such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; it also needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tactical insight , and a quick reaction . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
but F@@ rob@@ bing also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more an issue . &quot;
&quot; controls were difficult to carry out on online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing . &quot;
&quot; in a positive way , the scientist emphasizes the high integr@@ ative impact of E @-@ Sports . &quot;
&quot; players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural barriers . &quot;
a study by the Management Consulting Del@@ o@@ itte and the Bundes@@ verband Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth ahead of E @-@ Sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros were implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ship and big tour@@ neys . &quot;
&quot; in three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the E @-@ Sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; the Del@@ o@@ itte Consult@@ ants write . &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
&quot; big markets are Asia and the US , where former basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and bas@@ eball player Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez participate in the N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports team . &quot;
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport Wag@@ ners Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; in Europe too , things are happening . &quot;
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a subject , says F@@ rob@@ bing . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the Bundes@@ liga @-@ associations , according to D@@ utt , are now obliged to establish an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; Germany is la@@ gging behind in the European comparison , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Chairman R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; only to decay into nostal@@ gia , and to clear the old times , is not enough today . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t stick to it , that only in football everything remains as it always was . &quot;

Michelle Car@@ ter convic@@ ted of the texts Con@@ rad Roy has to commit suicide
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide . &quot;
&quot; Michelle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been exposed to par@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June for the neg@@ ligent murder of Con@@ rad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing , &quot; &quot; My family is in@@ consol@@ able . &quot;
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
&quot; she was faced with a maximum of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream @-@ colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she has no responsibility , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ters &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that they deeply regret .
&quot; however , Ju@@ dge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , did not find out that &quot; age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Roy &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said there was &quot; &quot; no day on which I am not praying the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try , in spite of all my pains that we will carry for eternity with us , to be there for his sisters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , testified that she was &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; by the realisation that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer have the only person I have been with since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case appears to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit another , commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
the case attracted national attention after Car@@ ters revealed text messages that encouraged him to end his life .
&quot; hang up , hop on a building , refresh yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news , which she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; All you have to do is turn on the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was looking at Roy &apos;s death and ordered them to benefit by some press from the case .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; the few who defended Car@@ ter belonged Am@@ anda Kno@@ x , who was convic@@ ted in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Michelle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not prison . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ me : learning from the new Mini @-@ Lah@@ m of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run as a captain at the Audi Cup is no coincidence .
the FC Bayern will watch a great season for the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not harm you .
&quot; something was different on his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kim@@ me immediately , even though the additional garment was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lah@@ m and no Manuel Neu@@ er could be seen , he made the rush of Bin@@ de straight to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer did not announce it , &quot; said the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain . &quot;
a good one could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples .
but the sign from the coach could also be interpreted in this way .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year older Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a leader in the C @-@ El@@ f as a guide for young players , de@@ but@@ ants and especially from holidays . &quot;
sugar is best distributed to those of whom you have a lot of confidence to keep you enter@@ tained .
&quot; those who have been chosen to take part in Lah@@ m &apos;s heritage , can only use a little extra motivation . &quot;
&quot; Kim@@ me confirmed : &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old moved into the field as a mini @-@ Lah@@ m . &quot;
&quot; to the right rear , that is his position , the white binding on the arm did the rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all Kim@@ i worked in this starting formation like the one , who can take the helm at the best . &quot;
he gave instructions and tried to direct the un@@ trained trou@@ pe .
&quot; he had a view of the whole , while many others were occupied with himself . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal thus , to over@@ play his missing fitness ( hardly worked ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches therefore , on the devil , to get out of the achievements of the Asia trip ( also only condition@@ ally ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le thus , in their first appearance in the Bayern Tri@@ ko@@ t , do not have a negative impact . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked quite well . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy up in front of the defense , Sü@@ le both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm is often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a couple of times in the game building . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that &quot; &quot; the result &quot; &quot; was not as we hoped for . &quot;
but he also showed a good performance during the debut .
&quot; shift of play , tempo change : &quot; for this style I was also picked up . &quot;
&quot; how unusual this Bavaria @-@ world is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ dy , for example , did not give one or two interviews in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
&quot; after a few cr@@ un@@ chy statements , Kim@@ oto said goodbye to his new fellow players . &quot;
&quot; there he heard from Sü@@ le an interesting proposition : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I have already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new one more . &quot;

company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises Wis@@ dom Tempo
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a shift in economic policy - and simultaneously add the old minister .
&quot; Frank Nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Trier companies ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the desires of the economy , which has blocked Lem@@ ke all . &quot;
the biggest turn@@ around sees nat@@ us in infrastructure policy : the gap between the motorway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021 is expected to be right . &quot;
&quot; the West is also playing a role in the plans of the country , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020 , says minist@@ erial spokes@@ woman Corn@@ elia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign for supporting regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier , as von Wis@@ sing , stri@@ ves to promote a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports falling for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to create their own company , praise the Chamber of Industry and Commerce . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees additional incentives for young apprenti@@ ces in the new master bonus , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euros is fores@@ een for the passing championship of the championship and 2500 Euros , if graduates become self @-@ employed within ten years of the master &apos;s training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road construction is quick to provide facts , but at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel , says Jan Glo@@ ck@@ auer , managing director of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) . &quot;
&quot; up to now , only 29 jobs have been occupied by 56 new engineers to employ Wis@@ sing at state mobility . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce asks for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U @-@ Group vice @-@ president Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf adds to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country invested more than 20 million euros less in the preservation of provincial roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept as to how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; furthermore , the hitherto existing broad@@ band expansion in the country is sober@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies only rated the grid supply in an I@@ HK @-@ survey only with a score of 3.4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
&quot; on the other hand , ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and still sits on the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens left Lem@@ ke to April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they had already cleared the field after four months of dis@@ agreements . &quot;
Audi is supposed to change 85@@ 0.000 diesel vehicles - autom@@ akers face a counter @-@ reaction
&quot; one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW chair said the company believes &quot; &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions &quot; , &quot; and was thus referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is located - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the enterprises as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations .
&quot; however , nitrogen oxi@@ des that em@@ it diesel engines are regarded as carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of car manufacturers , systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising exhaust f@@ umes generated by diesel vehicles also increases , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of failing to disgu@@ ise the powerful car companies and to ignore the signs of the problem .
&quot; companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called shut@@ down devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several employees of Volkswagen were charged , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics in the Audi engine development was arrested in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of installing a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and an inquiry focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the investigation could seriously burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to Volkswagen &apos;s profit .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; once again on Saturday to the Is@@ ar , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;

&quot; on the raft , one sees a large inf@@ low @-@ saver . &quot;
it shows a garbage mountain .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .

Mor@@ dil@@ los pop @-@ n@@ oses and laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most published cartoon characters , the no@@ d@@ ules of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; even with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still recording and working on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laugh , &quot; because there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first few years as an artist , he suggested , among other things , as drau@@ gh@@ ts@@ man for greetings cards - what fru@@ strated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; following the stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Star &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
the artists of cities were inspired again and again .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures revol@@ ve in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own information , he still sits at the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; with cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , its cute figures still find a lot of spreading worldwide . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has been working on a cartoon animation and a TV series with his characters for six years . &quot;
the main character in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los &apos;s most beloved animal in his drawings - he has a jack @-@ of @-@ the @-@ hand player as a counter player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is supposed to come to the cinema wall in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; therefore he tends to focus on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threat@@ ens climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change . &quot;
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of drought conditions and insects committed due to drought , which causes great headaches for scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , an expert in the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence has been effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small ci@@ ca@@ ine , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ ci@@ ca@@ des , and in very dry weather there are very many of them . &quot;
and there is much at stake .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil not only attracts holiday@@ makers , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plant ears with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ down of evap@@ oration from the soil , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n is celebrating its 1200 year anniversary this year .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet on Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ce@@ asing drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , Neut@@ ral , Al@@ lies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and abdominal pain are sufficient . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government &apos;s salary list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no resp@@ ite from violence , and while the bodies pile up throughout the country , more and more journalists are in the process : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena N@@ ie@@ to res@@ igned in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter is its editor and its inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder of Ja@@ vier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two re@@ porters in the 1930 &apos;s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or typical Pan@@ am@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters will discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der At@@ tor@@ ney General was set up in 2010 to process the cases of journalists , it has only launched two criminal proceedings in accordance with the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders linked to drug traffi@@ cking and organised crime each year , journalists are rarely challenged by journalists . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ consol@@ able and although the terrain is now even more tre@@ ach@@ erous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little use , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez reli@@ ed on the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the state capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; &quot; twelve river &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a woman and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; but on the topic of Val@@ dez , there is practically nothing but silence . &quot;
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the past year and the extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a became one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions struggle here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it does not matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a anyone or several people are shot at the street or that the gra@@ vey@@ ard is full of ornam@@ ented , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; peace &quot; when only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke with his guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes two mis@@ concep@@ tions have contributed to the murder .
&quot; firstly , in February the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el fac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , presum@@ ed gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was not to comp@@ el Val@@ dez to leave the country for its own security following the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . &quot;
he survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .
&quot; he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollar hol@@ dings . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
journalists loved to be able to publish intri@@ cate investigations without fear of cens@@ orship and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dar@@ ed to treat .
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez gained the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I want to continue living , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; drug traffi@@ cking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; &quot; is a way of life , &quot; &quot; he said in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV last October . &quot;
you have to take over the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ b .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why didn &apos;t you say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could cur@@ b like a port @-@ worker , the friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit on the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine destruction ?
&quot; his death also forced her to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and landing run@@ ways &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust your own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells bad , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happened to Ja@@ vier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just like in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mix of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape changes constantly .
&quot; days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , exclusively sold to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside two polic@@ emen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a central @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in a joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves if these officers were among the 50 per cent of the police officers who were not trust@@ worthy of the Gover@@ nor themselves . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters go to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ odo@@ ce has printed three main stories . &quot;
there was the assass@@ ination of the brother of the former famous boxing champion Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an exposure to state expendi@@ tures focused on the governor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
&quot; and there was a group , one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the office of the prosec@@ utor , carried out a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the reign@@ ing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption of high cali@@ ber cases . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez also viewed the Val@@ dez column as the best informed source about kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we knew what happened , &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; because of his slim physi@@ que . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . &quot;
Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and sti@@ ckers that protest against the mur@@ ders of journalists because the employees have become something they themselves never expected : activists in the name of the press .
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez s@@ nat@@ ched a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez was killed , in the western state of Mi@@ cho@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its .
&quot; throughout the country , journalists have become ph@@ one@@ tic , having written &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; protests and constructions in organized protests . &quot;
&quot; on that day , the director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case . &quot;
&quot; during a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the murder of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez bl@@ amed the authorities to spy on journalists and put them around because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since asked for her to be divided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger hurt her obj@@ ectivity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , by participating government officials and an in@@ different society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media W@@ äch@@ ter@@ gruppe &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
obviously the mur@@ ders have a deter@@ rent effect .
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lava Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of their director in 2004 .
in 2010 Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still monitor the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that the drug trade scar@@ es him . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began tot@@ aling . &quot;
a series of shooting with rival riv@@ als and security forces near Maz@@ at@@ lan seaside resort had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated further as promised by a number of cart@@ el messages in the region .
&quot; from the cur@@ b &apos;s edge , they have published the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce about mobile phones . &quot;
the cover page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens how@@ l near - another shooting in the area .
&quot; Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez cast a glance at the polic@@ emen who kept watch , to see if they were ready . &quot;
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot;
&quot; under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you think of it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if the same day , when Ja@@ vier was murdered , the intern asked me to send them to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ r used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid enemies
&quot; at first sight it looks like a statue , though a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible rhin@@ o@@ cer@@ os of a Canadian mining worker have been preserved so well that experts have described it as &quot; &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa der Dinosau@@ rs &quot; . &quot; &quot;
it was so good that they could even find that his sc@@ aly skin was red@@ dish brown - and they said they had had something from a &quot; rest@@ less past . &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Bi@@ ology &quot; described it as &quot; the best preserved din@@ osau@@ r ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ r specimens in the world . &quot; &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his unbeliev@@ ably well preserved condition has ast@@ o@@ unded researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to National Ge@@ ographic reports , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn Funk was found on 21 March 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
he hit something that was out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to discover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy ground cl@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you b@@ link only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r specimens , the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a shifting tank , probably was threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ sh@@ ading , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed it to better mix with its surroundings and escape its enemies , say experts , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by larger din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the family of the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier has made head@@ lines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Ty@@ rr@@ ell Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ na@@ ch@@ elli , according to Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell &apos;s museum technician , one of a team that has spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours with it carefully . &quot;
the astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arms about his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals . &quot;
&quot; it indicates that the din@@ osau@@ r has been ch@@ ased by eating din@@ osau@@ rs of enough pressure , that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es must have been in the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on po@@ inters on his life , including his con@@ served performer , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank down to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern flour@@ ishing today , and rivers and oceans probably much farther inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal &quot; , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just squ@@ int a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he &apos;s asleep . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period was a time when giant ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs standing on two legs crossed the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Rex , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was ch@@ ased by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; it belongs to the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 feet ( 11.@@ 5 m ) long , six tons heavier monster . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in Current Bi@@ ology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in the mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk when he dug in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on March 21 , 2011 . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the best kept din@@ osau@@ r in the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely removed from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes ra@@ ged by his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous was sw@@ amped by Western Canada until a flooded river floo@@ ding it into the open sea .
but the underwater coverage of the din@@ osau@@ r kept its arm@@ our in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house bust forms still b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as &apos; rare as a gain in the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I look at it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right foref@@ oot lies on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales at its sole .
in the storm : mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age at A@@ 8 : many wounded
a violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
there are numerous injured and long @-@ lived stems - and G@@ aff@@ er .
&quot; on the highway Stuttgart @-@ München ( A@@ 8 ) , around 20 people were injured in a mass ar@@ am@@ bol@@ age late Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , about 17@@ .00 o &apos;clock between the junction stations Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) were almost 30 vehicles , including trucks . &quot;
&quot; at first , no information was given about the exact number of publishers . &quot;
&quot; it was a matter of light to moderate injuries , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large amount of emergency vehicles was charged at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of the city of Munich , an approximately ten @-@ kilometer retreat was formed . &quot;
&quot; as reported by an A@@ Z journalist , it was also on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ gade noted the characteristics of the vehicle electri@@ cians , who now have to reck@@ on with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : consolidated &quot; Comfort check @-@ in &quot;
&quot; it is a moment that almost everyone has experienced once : nothing happens , one sits in the train and sleeps . &quot;
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant mind .
and then : buff@@ ered .
the conductor comes and w@@ akes an unpleasant one or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket inspec@@ tors .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are soon over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the driver @-@ free ticket control .
&quot; you simply confirm by mobile , that you take your seat and vali@@ date your ticket . &quot;
&quot; at present , a test run is running on two tracks . &quot;
&quot; if the offer arrives , we will expand it . &quot;
&quot; it is expected to be available on many other long distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a train spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; calls the railway ticket de@@ valuation without Schaff@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; to be able to use them , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to have an online ticket - which is already the most passengers .
&quot; it is also necessary to have purchased the DB navig@@ ator app , which is the easiest way to book your ticket anyway . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; &quot; works like that : you enter the train , call his ticket under &quot; &quot; My tickets &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test customers , a button for the electronic evaluation will appear . &quot;
the train atten@@ d@@ ants receive a message on their mobile devices that Pass@@ enger X is in the train and has taken the booked seats .
&quot; when the train atten@@ dant arrives at the ticket inspection at number Y , he knows that a passenger sits there with an already paid online ticket . &quot;
&quot; so you can sleep , continue to work , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; Check @-@ in &quot; has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to travel through our train atten@@ d@@ ants without ticket control , simply check the DB Navig@@ ator yourself . &quot;
&quot; this allows passengers to make their travel time on the move more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , DB Fern@@ verkehr &quot; Marketing Management Board . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who travel often , know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; because often you have , in any case , one of the travelling companions not all the documents you need to de@@ grade online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card is missing or a document you have to show .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between the train atten@@ dant and passenger , resulting in a bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and taking the time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that applies only to ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen connections .
more conc@@ ise numbers on the same track are not un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; are Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Ferr@@ ell was shaken to its core . &quot;
&quot; only one day after she arrived in New York City , she was sitting in St. Louis &quot; s office on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
they stum@@ bled over a post by someone from high school .
&quot; the police had just killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the street , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; confused as no one else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly being saved on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was killed , the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted a picture of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell . &quot;
but death was nothing new for her and her community .
she left her cell phone to return later in the evening to T@@ we@@ ets about people at the Can@@ field @-@ Drive .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people shou@@ ting , and of a man claiming to be Brown &apos;s father who carried a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police have just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed at which a polic@@ eman was standing in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman took his ri@@ fle and cried , &quot; &quot; I will kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; Ferr@@ ell rec@@ alled her statement . &quot;
this is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call typical .
&quot; at that moment , I felt ch@@ ills . &quot;
I was angry and cried . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11@@ pm she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would go to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
&quot; what happened in the next three years with Ferr@@ ell and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the subject of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11th century . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; when Ferr@@ ell came to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on with her daughter , who wore a cau@@ l@@ dron and a suitable crown , the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &quot; on the black experience and the black state . &quot; &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed an 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I could not take her with me , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell later . &quot;
what has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am fortunate enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience bl@@ at@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women child . &quot;
I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from them .
&quot; the first station , when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , was on the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the potential non @-@ prosecution of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there , Ferr@@ ell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Ferr@@ ell .
&quot; my activ@@ ism changed completely after August 9 , &quot; she said , realizing that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association , focusing on eating justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Ferr@@ ell met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her c@@ amer@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came up Ferr@@ ell in the sense : &quot; do you want to document , or do you try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often of wh@@ ites , in a community prof@@ iting from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt passengers . &quot;
&quot; Ferr@@ ell brought the project closer , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ning &apos;s shot . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me to show how these people are represented , for like that I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ell &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a Messiah guide , but a community that comes together , &quot; said Fol@@ ay@@ an - it proved to be the most open participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ ell &apos;s life , as she falls in love with and mar@@ ries her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I have understood that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ ell &apos;s story repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin have shaped the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall , &quot; &quot; said Ferr@@ ell , &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting at different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to notice that &quot; &quot; the movement is really held up by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ cal type of action , &quot; in which Ferr@@ ell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not by chance , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman stands as much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the telecommunications cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial lines between the church and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Ferr@@ ell is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
&quot; however , she cl@@ ings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .

we must love and support one another .

from &quot; Dream &quot; to &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania &quot; : TV readers discuss bit @-@ gallery
the bit gallery moves people even though they haven &apos;t been built for a long time .
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been spl@@ itting people into advoc@@ ates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .
&quot; cold , the topic hardly leaves one . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while one can say to the bit gallery : &quot; that would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while advoc@@ ates are building a gallery to attract more customers to the city , from which the rest of the shops will benefit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products . &quot;
&quot; with the beginning of the construction work , it will end . &quot;
the Gallery @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Sim@@ one Room : &quot; we have been selling in the farmer &apos;s market almost every week for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the ladies ever very gladly . &quot;
also the but@@ cher shop we discovered for us .
we would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
in other cities there is also this .
&quot; especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct market@@ ers settle in a market hall in the gallery comes to the height of the rent .
&quot; this should probably not be very low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what are the shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothes , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think that is superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is already enough in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap at the top . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops are only rented by larger companies in a shopping centre , as the r@@ ents there are often un@@ sustainable for a retail@@ er . &quot;
&quot; too bad , special transactions are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping centre with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit me together .
and the gallery doesn &apos;t fit to Bit@@ burg .
&quot; first of all , where should the farmer &apos;s market hall be built during the construction period ? &quot;
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes .
or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to sell all the shops from Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; that just won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the unbeliev@@ ably many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg are no longer a place . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear . &quot;
a fitting simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the premis@@ e of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces can be seen - white , black and brown that almost resemble themselves - that hang on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ Tu@@ fts and hair@@ cuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent out the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth jail , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after being classified as secret diplom@@ acy on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
the new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Bec@@ oming St@@ resem@@ b@@ lance ( A fitting resem@@ b@@ lance ) .
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline agreed upon her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ wife and pioneering dissi@@ dent whose condem@@ nation was transformed by Barack Obama , when he only had three days in his ministry . &quot;
&quot; through algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted from man@@ ing and created from the 30 portraits , how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data , a sharp , albeit slightly intellectual commentary , is created not only to the form@@ ability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also of identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges including six violations of the es@@ pion@@ age law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her picture was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black and white bl@@ ond in which Mann@@ ing obviously sits on a driver &apos;s seat and carries a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg originated from the great success of its 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot;
in it the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ to@@ cks and chew@@ ing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .
this was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she couldn &apos;t go to that time and she couldn &apos;t be photographed , so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; in the course of two years , the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated m@@ use became un@@ equal e@@ ye@@ witnesses who exchanged several letters over the course of two years . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; supplement image , &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ il@@ i Kan@@ ung@@ o , which fores@@ aw a future in which President Chel@@ seas Law would convert and it would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; that Obama , in fact , only a few days after the book was published , would demand Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Tr@@ ump conduc@@ ts a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops in order to find new , twe@@ et@@ able ways to avoid the rigid divisions that he actually should fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said &quot; &quot; things happen for a particular reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing demanded with her excessive signature below ( the &quot; i &quot; in her family name is marked with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequences are written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des according to the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , as amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take away is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video work of 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , is also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic @-@ nov@@ elle . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a hands @-@ free phone in the hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong .
&quot; if they make your speech cold , then they have won . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , greeting from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ umps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it , she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room , from her own gen@@ om@@ ic simul@@ ac@@ les , which inter@@ ming@@ le like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also pur@@ pos@@ eful , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ ature ) , in which their genetic Hap@@ lo@@ ids were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg said of the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor at the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of the University of Oxford investigated for killing
&quot; a country@@ wide hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee at Oxford University , who will be looked for as susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago . &quot;
on Monday W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ got ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued arrest warran@@ ts for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au as the acts of the District Court of Cook County show .
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au died 26 , after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the cor@@ pse was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was still declared dead at the place of events , and Det@@ ective investig@@ ates the stit@@ ches as murder while the police are actively looking for the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them is professor of micro@@ biology and immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Ad@@ ult , the vice @-@ president of university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ un@@ ame should now be judged and excluded from entering the Campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal responsibility examined by the competent authorities and the Nor@@ th@@ western University co @-@ operates with this investigation , &quot; said Cub@@ itt . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treas@@ ury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a speaker from the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly calls on the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce each other , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities help to find susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received an en@@ ig@@ matic tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear , whether the incident took place on July 27 . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ dies and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the inhabitants : &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; we will close the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian vice @-@ president Mut@@ ko
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not be long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in co @-@ operation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map has been updated in this respect , &quot; stated mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map for compliance with the code , which describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria listed in the list , however , states that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities have to publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian lawyer , Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren , to publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; regarding the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; we carry out the investigation as our Anti @-@ D@@ oping system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ kos &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the head of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with Russian sales point r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov gave problems to the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one preten@@ ded to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
&quot; in November 2015 , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the D@@ oping scandal of the WA@@ DA by conducting dop@@ ing controls in Russia . &quot;
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; following a visit to the Moscow headquarters in July , WA@@ DA General Director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli commented that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was moving &quot; in the right direction &quot; in order to be used again . &quot;

start @-@ ups that will help your business not become the next U@@ ber
A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up but the surveys did not work .
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or worse - frau@@ dul@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply no consistency and obj@@ ectivity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Society Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she called for help from outside .
a new Human Resource start @-@ up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement , it enables companies to perform surveys , provide special groups and demographic groups , employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases , W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow managers to b@@ ypass the C @-@ suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for pursuing their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ LIN@@ T , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ LIN@@ T .
&quot; in addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low cons@@ ents results - so that you can re@@ bo@@ itate why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you will not be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nu@@ is@@ ances in which those who have spoken are punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups such as G@@ LIN@@ T , this request is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; the global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion in 2020 , according to the Finance website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ everything in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
U@@ ber has recently signed up as a client .
&quot; as G@@ LIN@@ T , Con@@ ver@@ cent enables companies to send tailor @-@ made &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behavior .
&quot; and if the main managing director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the court of public opinion has captured the regulator , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , the founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that treats its employees poorly or beha@@ ves un@@ eth@@ ically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the past , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e @-@ mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a timi@@ dity and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by Tu@@ es@@ days General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ descent , problems that were previously hidden by managers who were sitting in offices in cities or countries - such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic 360 @-@ degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who leads the Risk Management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment law disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical bre@@ aches by the En@@ ron scandal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ LIN@@ T and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that will find the approval of venture capital investors who supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itter@@ ing won $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer &apos;s Venture Partners , bringing the total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing research complex , showing that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only assignments . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that hears their voices and that the work that you do is worthwhile , then they feel more oblig@@ ated to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , VP of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ gence and G@@ LIN@@ T . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten when their portfolio companies run well . companies run well when employees are committed and committed .
&quot; if the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
&quot; indeed , when a company asks employees after your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , it can breed dis@@ appointments and de@@ motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 requests , you must be prepared to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting in Business Management company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that have reli@@ ed on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; because if you do not follow , staff will ask , &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate actions on the same day , if a problem is reported by G@@ LIN@@ T , says Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from fru@@ strated staff , she was able to re @-@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights about the employees , and hopes that in the long run this will lead to a better binding of employees in an industry that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it &apos;s about 23 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers talk on one side of the new practice areas of the team on the campus .
some have pulled off their jer@@ sey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break . &quot;
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 pm .
&quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys over the next three days , &quot; Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a said just before Monday became Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Bru@@ ins postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as six playing times in West@@ wood practi@@ sed practical exercises . &quot;
&quot; over the course of August 18 , 18 exercises are to be held . 20 before the start of formal game preparations for the kick @-@ off against Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said he supports N@@ CA@@ A &apos;s change of rules , even if they add another point to the multiple routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they go on , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will termin@@ ate its practices once the camp is completed , which is not an easy task in view of the clear line of sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that is already cleared with pe@@ dest@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and setting up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good business . &quot;
&quot; but we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking lot 8 . &quot;
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts verification in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third parties fake reviews and then display their results below the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of its efforts to fight so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated mechanical learning methods to detect potential false reports and to send them to fac@@ tual verb@@ anks , which may show results of the fact @-@ check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of whom believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential election in May , and Germany supports a plan to quickly eradic@@ ate hate @-@ filled post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook in a separate statement in German states that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out what stories are challenged by fac@@ tual verb@@ s of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook messages in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the &quot; &quot; related items &quot; &quot; and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his younger past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cosy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ tic Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I think it &apos;s so nice to look at someone &apos;s hand@@ writing that has been dead for 300 years , &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expectedly emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I just responded to the thumb@@ print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is his thumb print !
&quot; and letters smell always smoke , because at that time a fire was ign@@ ited because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome gru@@ dge , &quot; ) seems all too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in tren@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landsc@@ aping , gar@@ dening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank a whis@@ key and started to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was granted full access until 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the cler@@ ks began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years &quot; in which aristo@@ cr@@ ats said &quot; Oh , cast it onto the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from England &apos;s period , cards that represent who owned something : &quot; you might think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go its way ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to sink into English history on a broader base , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of a tur@@ mo@@ il that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ ghtly Family of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , &quot; Rho@@ des says . &quot;
the peasant uprising started in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good start .
maybe the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ cher who hid the Dar@@ r@@ ell family for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ g@@ gler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gler Arthur Dar@@ r@@ ell is represented in the 18th century , who staged his own funeral , filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coff@@ in was dug ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos; favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite Ga@@ un@@ er , always making debts and spending money on things they couldn &apos;t afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ r@@ ell @-@ men solved their school crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a he@@ ap of good looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his use at the castle , Rho@@ des is searching for other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ defic@@ mä@@ ki , the terrain of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like : &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ n life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle obs@@ cured in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the opening of the 30@@ 1 @-@ year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f launched its campaign on Friday to launch a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau of Thursday ) . &quot;
mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team led by Nelson Ar@@ tz wanted to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday .
&quot; at the end of August , as the highlight of the campaign , there will be a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the cre@@ ators of the action have been asking the posters at the chapel at the Chapel of Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; they write on their web site , which was released yesterday . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that many things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are convinced that as Bad Hon@@ ne@@ fer citizens we are very well aware of the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; just &quot; a logo and a slogan , it says . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city a unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they compete with other communities . &quot;
the city of Bad Hon@@ ne@@ f has a new umbrella brand and the campaign costs an average five @-@ digit amount .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; each year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) deliber@@ ates on retirement and transpor@@ tations in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
this is also this week .
at first glance a normal operation .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; under the presi@@ dency of the head of government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs took part in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; as a result , civilians in the Y@@ AS were in number . &quot;
the government is pulling the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; the Chief of Staff , Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar , remains in office , but the officers of the Army , the Air Force and the Navy were dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the coup failed , heads of state Erdo@@ gan claimed 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , the leader of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the coup attempt as a &quot; &quot; gift of God &quot; &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to &quot; &quot; completely clean the armed forces . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan hold the army really under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; Un@@ e@@ as@@ iness in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about increasing the &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the head@@ scar@@ f ban on female soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the Grand Master &apos;s affairs with the army and the security forces continue . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July Erdo@@ gan issued another 7@@ 3@@ 95 civil servant , among them 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan was t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als used to be the masters of the country earlier .
three times they put@@ ted on their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; after his election victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan th@@ ron@@ ged the military &apos;s power step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is pushing ahead with the Islam@@ isation of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an un@@ named officer who sought asylum from persecution abroad after the attempted coup attempt , the Turkish army would be &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if that is true , such a development could not allow Nato to get cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , in the alliance after the pur@@ ges , there is doubt about the Turkish army &apos;s readiness to deploy . &quot;
&quot; the leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weakened , &quot; say NATO diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tr@@ ump , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he intends to lower the legal migrants to € 50,000 per year , stric@@ ter rules for obtaining vis@@ as for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the bill will be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidate who speaks English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; said Tr@@ ump , quoted by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate route for road shuttle bus
&quot; over and over again , over the past few months , the future of the racing car has been cont@@ ested - now it is supposed to go very fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , it is planned to build on the di@@ lap@@ id@@ ated track on which the tourist train travels . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the vehicle traffic utt@@ les in the long term , construction work on the track should start this year according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and rehabil@@ itate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is linked to this particularly important link for tourism , &quot; declared Federal Minister of Transport Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost of repair the route was estimated at around 2.5 million euros .
&quot; from this sum , the country over@@ flows 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in future from the country , is currently being fin@@ alised , explained S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the Süd@@ ther@@ ür@@ ingen Bahn as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the timet@@ able , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; as a result , the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle will be ordered regularly in December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular rail link between the Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation , it was tested over the past few months whether the route is used by many people to order it regularly in the future . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the track is partly steep in parts . &quot;
the rise of sex robots is real and we should worry
&quot; just as you thought it can &apos;t be any more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots will come . &quot;
yes indeed .
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Emer@@ itus Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must begin to take their ascen@@ sion seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of finger nail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will get them a lot more frequently , &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey at the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sex pupp@@ ets have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and choose anything from the eye colour of the robot via the shape of the nip@@ ples to the type or color of his finger@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman progres@@ sively look . &quot;
modern sex pupp@@ ets have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there are the Ro@@ xx@@ xy gold sex robots , developed by True Compan@@ ion , with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as best as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion website . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
in the course of the day she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people !
&quot; it can be tired , be fixed to conversation , or it can be &quot; in mood . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects of this ascen@@ sion of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female characteristics , the allu@@ sions to rape if one walks a step towards fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : resist@@ ing ) Far@@ rah , troubled one the most . &quot;
&quot; true Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy is compatible with a vibr@@ ator on his website , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can &apos;t men then have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; is it on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not only a fe@@ tish or just another sex toys . &quot;
&quot; their origin and increasing refin@@ ement point to something ha@@ ze and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will , of course , not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their rising popularity , they still remain on the br@@ ink of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what is perme@@ ated out of the boundary zones , can be very instruc@@ tive with respect to the spirit of the time we live in . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives them permission .
&quot; there is , however , a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots will emerge in a time in which the rights of women are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who has said that they have sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted women . &quot;
&quot; the most dis@@ appo@@ inting aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand @-@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the ent@@ win@@ ed body and the out@@ stretched eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resem@@ b@@ lance to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ graphic proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human@@ ely that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , brought to the point when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that hin@@ ders independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are pleasing slaves . &quot;
or to put it in the language of 2017 : ma@@ ids
d@@ umps big performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of a healthy human mind
&quot; it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tr@@ ump @-@ Er@@ a that the political divisions , which pol@@ arized U.S. voters , also split families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were newspapers in the USA with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tr@@ ump @-@ sel@@ ectable relatives .
we all re@@ port@@ edly look at all of us to blow up our filtration bags .
less notice has been the power of tr@@ umps to bring together families .
&quot; I mention this because my c@@ ousin , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tr@@ ump in the White House , everyone she knows , including the Repub@@ lican relationship with which she fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it is in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tr@@ ump , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tr@@ ump , we refer to the sp@@ oo@@ ky possibility that one day his bi@@ bs will no longer be rep@@ ul@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ time scenario in which Tr@@ ump Repub@@ lic@@ ans norm@@ alize the right wing , which suddenly appear as a notion of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to his standards . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself falling from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s original version of the Cra@@ zy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked like ) - both in fact seem to be a very mild off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; when Tr@@ ump goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be only mentally healthy in order to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my c@@ ousin was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city , if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals are twi@@ sting to look at their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climate @-@ per@@ mitting music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite across the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the topics @-@ pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counting - but a big round@@ about in the north of London . &quot;
&quot; however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , since two @-@ year @-@ old , an 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ th years can go on it and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it afterwards . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to rate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this not only leads to slow@@ ing down what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where none is required . &quot;
the poor woman in the department store stood ap@@ olo@@ ge@@ tically gr@@ ins@@ ing while I was tired of the experience to extend my credit card with five stars .
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was hosp@@ ital@@ ised for the treatment of cuts to his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
&quot; after a call by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors , Pist@@ ori@@ us was sentenced to a first death belt . &quot;
&quot; he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early hours of Valentine &apos;s Day in 2013 , firing it several times through a door of the toilet in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he kept his girlfriend for a ni@@ ghtly intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say that they are too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
the National Criminal Law Agency said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year .
Pist@@ ori@@ us is in danger that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
&quot; as a farmer , Arnold finds a strange egg &quot;
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four@@ thous@@ anders from F@@ oters and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen were released into the vac@@ ations and secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; in the future , three of the students will go to secondary school , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and public representatives at the Bi@@ es@@ ental Bürger@@ haus in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 pupils of the four classes , headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , chose a young eagle growing up in the farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the lively band introduced a musical titled &quot; The Eagle at the chickens &quot; farm . &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it hat@@ ch it from his chickens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a little eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken out of him crushed , the eagle wi@@ ped off his wings on a high mountain and escaped . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in the recording of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ les , who wore cylinders to raise the bet . &quot;
&quot; the Eagle stands for integration , said school director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
he will never be like a chicken .
his destiny is to be free .
she wished every quar@@ rel that he felt accepted in his new school .
&quot; thank you to the colleagues , former school director Michael Mu@@ eller , who is jumping again and again with teaching bott@@ len@@ ecks , and the parents &apos; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the kitchen time is over now , explained class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , she did not leave her class@@ mates very reluct@@ ant , for it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , she was able to rely on the four@@ thous@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; at the end , all students gathered a song of summer time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; with the children , great joy broke out . &quot;
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were deta@@ ined for illegal camps in Greece , distributed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illeg@@ ally deta@@ ined people was arrested by the police in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have exac@@ erb@@ ated the control of the free camp and place anyone found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose , considerable fin@@ es . &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said the court could impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what those affected need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
do diesel drivers need to participate in the campaign ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5,@@ 3 million cars . &quot;
they are supposed to improve the emission performance of vehicles of the emission classes Euro 5 and partially Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ Diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :
is the new action mandatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates tra@@ ded are optional . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates before are only valid for vehicles that have Schumann software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
its retro@@ fitting was ordered by the German Federal Statisti@@ cal Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers announced a spe@@ edy implementation in the coming months , but not yet called an exact date . &quot;
Daimler has informed each person concerned to write .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , that will be done in its framework . &quot;
how long should the retro@@ fitting move altogether ?
&quot; it &apos;s hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
it depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment so far . &quot;
how long will the update last ?
the change@@ over itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ace advises to wait .
&quot; presumably , foreign manufacturers would follow , says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is a massive price drop of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threatened ?
the ACE fears this .
but even in regions where prohi@@ bitions are threatening .
&quot; in rural areas , there is so far no loss of value for older diesel . &quot;

the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glam@@ orous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tr@@ ump promises to be political .
one of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to receive one of the cov@@ eted awards from the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) are among the hon@@ ors . &quot;
the awards are presented at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , US President Donald Tr@@ ump will host a reception and join with his wife Mel@@ ania at the ceremony . &quot;
the award winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV shows already announced that he would be willing to take part in the gala .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that strains me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tr@@ ump to clarify her point of view .
&quot; Kennedy @-@ Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;
&quot; former award winners include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city liv@@ able
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re next year . &quot;
&quot; the site is already written out - however , suitable applicants are rare . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has been the City Buil@@ der . &quot;
and the work makes him a lot of fun as he medi@@ ates in the press conference .
&quot; he reports on varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is surprising that until now no application has fulfilled the requirements profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; so , considering the regular periods of notice , there will be enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach works for the administration community as the Lower House of Building Law , the applicant must provide appropriate degrees . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would not be able to fill them out , the citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for consultation . &quot;
&quot; but the proximity to the city and itself is important to him , says W@@ acker , who reports about a good working atmosphere and good atmosphere between the authorities and the citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in ministry , some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the hack@@ ers with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is confident about the construction office and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the res@@ hap@@ ing of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a are@@ al and the Nieder@@ ho@@ ven park@@ platz , for example , have been initiated . &quot;
&quot; the Kin@@ zig Bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , and stadium san@@ itation is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will beat about 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker estimates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; design is available for a city building master , great room for manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ la@@ chs &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dening , many things can be flexibly responded to . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town as an ensemble is listed as a monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what fits into it &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city building master emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the City Buil@@ der is responsible . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he can count on long@@ standing employees in support and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; W@@ acker wants his successor for a long time , says W@@ acker : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and wanted to stay with the job . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working atmosphere , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to be heir to Roland W@@ acker , according to the town of Has@@ lach , you should have a degree in studying architecture as a diploma engineer or a bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture and have good expertise in the fields of planning and construction planning . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt are subject to high and civil engineering , construction planning , under@@ mining matters , municipal estate management , urban garden with building yard and urban garden landsc@@ aping , as well as the sub@@ urban building law office , including historic monuments . &quot;
bike thrown on lines : ground road closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown offen@@ ders had thrown the blue bicycle from the railroad crossing in the area of the Le@@ oben Road ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
these were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out from two male perpetr@@ ators and have been looking for them since the night .
&quot; close to the scene , a red sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver were witnessed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a bou@@ lev@@ ard , &quot; &quot; said Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch as AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators themselves would have put themselves in danger and je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the plant , as well as the delay of delay and the cost of moving the rail , the railway customers could also be transferred to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; in total , a &quot; significant &quot; sum should be taken out , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the southern track could be led without disabilities . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning had dropped out of nearly ten persons , two of which were related to the long @-@ haul traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains did not fall out , but they had late . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB speaker Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of pipes had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
red meat and dairy products and chocolate might help to allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease )
red meat and chocolate may sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
but a new study maintains the exact opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products could allevi@@ ate the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bow@@ el disease .
&quot; the incur@@ able condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States causes stomach cra@@ mps and blo@@ ating , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot;
&quot; while people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells in the intest@@ ine pat@@ rol in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes , which hide in food , do not penetrate the body . &quot;
cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues .
&quot; if the balance tends to go too far towards inflammation , it may result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
experiments have shown that a type of tolerance enhancing immune cell is found in mice carrying a specific bacter@@ ium in their initi@@ ates .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a link between a species of bacteria - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han supplement more tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system also works with people . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explored a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe but which was separately accommod@@ ated , did not have this . &quot;
&quot; it assumed that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ases of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i that normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were sequ@@ enced and six bacterial species were found , which were present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were wound up in a sterile environment , so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they were given the L. reu@@ ter@@ i and the immune cells . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on im@@ mature immune cells , which were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; as the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it proved to be a by@@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice &apos;s food , the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent , but when the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan declared that people have the same toler@@ ating cells as mice and that most of us protect L. reu@@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ines .
potential high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
&quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; committed to N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic &quot;
&quot; when Manchester United signed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after the mid @-@ field player on Wednesday evening had made his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 win in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Cup against Real Madrid started on Tuesday and impressed in the pen role , as people like Paul Pog@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; matic , however , had been excluded from the preparations @-@ Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho admitted that he had to improve before the beginning of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , also Victor Lin@@ del@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u launched in Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho formed his Start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; this week , the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to meet three of its four priority new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have given great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the sil@@ houette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the U.S. state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in US state Mich@@ ig@@ an and moved to the form of a Dream@@ liner over the U.S. , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action took 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
&quot; previously , Boeing had made such advertising . &quot;
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new depth for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; as the wind turns , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel &apos;s SPD chief was , Social @-@ Democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; but no fire from the party centre , merely a head@@ wind from the Bund , was the most important wish of the campaig@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus staff constantly monitor events in the SPD @-@ governed state capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year , would not be described in the approach by head@@ winds . &quot;
there were failures .
and one by one .
&quot; according to the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the German Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows that red @-@ green is simply un@@ reliable to go@@ vern , &quot; said CD@@ U secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprise faction of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties threw the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .
&quot; five months before the Sunday elections , its red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green Federal Executive Officer Michael Kell@@ ner called on the stub@@ born Lower Saxony Green Party to return her mandate .
the transition to CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the voters &apos; will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ jackets must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive and Ele@@ ction Director of the Green Party editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; an SPD elec@@ torate si@@ ghs , when on Friday morning the new ob@@ scene message reaches the party centre . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CD@@ U without its own government majority following the over@@ step of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ jackets . &quot;
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD state associations .
and nobody knows what &apos;s next .
the Mis@@ er began with the un@@ expectedly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades re@@ treated at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; it was then - and indeed , everything became much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel broke the SPD , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te sli@@ pped the party smoothly . &quot;
the comrades strug@@ gled with difficulty in the weeks afterwards .
&quot; then , when they had just hat@@ ched new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came . &quot;
and with him came the next deep blow .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD chief of the SPD , lost his nim@@ bus this weekend , because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie while his city was burning . &quot;
&quot; and because , in crisis communications , he made so much wrong about what to do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW exhaust @-@ gas and its role in the supervisory board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has already been critici@@ zed for some time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , mi@@ ese survey values were added . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , or maybe because of that , Wei@@ l has always tried to set accents in the German Con@@ federation in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the ambition of the former mayor of Hanover , to expand its power in Berlin , was not concealed by comrades in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they let him , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
now the exact opposite could happen .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony &apos;s Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz at all not .
&quot; for the time being , comrades , therefore , try to keep their ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and here above all to the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ al T@@ west . &quot;
&quot; it is intol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ ester puts on her own career fairs on the interests of all the others , &quot; &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party lef@@ tist parliamentary group in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ jackets is not elected as a direct candidate for her person , but has been elected to the Parliament via the state list of the Lower Saxony Green Party , thus further the de@@ pu@@ ties of Lower Saxony . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins about an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the electoral welcome four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career aspir@@ ation of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; Op@@ per@@ mann continued . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments from the CD@@ U of Lower Saxony .
funding money for town centre III
&quot; if you want to renov@@ ate your house , you will soon be able to get assistance from the country . &quot;
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ in@@ dler and three representatives St@@ eg urban development informed on Wednesday in sens@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ in@@ dler again gave a review of what happened so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there are certain areas of rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; back then , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg still took over two @-@ thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was at least 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ in@@ dler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; achievement project &quot; - it is important to also promote interior development , and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the President of the Government of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III . &quot;
&quot; the funding amount amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 Euro , of which 500 000 would come from the country , the rest from the community sens@@ ations . &quot;
how does a renovation area arise ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ in@@ dler , where the &quot; really old &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the regional boundaries may also shift again . &quot;
&quot; the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; Keller presented the contents of the federal government programme &quot; Social Town , &quot; where the renov@@ ations were then carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving living and working conditions and maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be performed object @-@ related , that is per plot . &quot;
the rehabilitation area would then finally be set as a by@@ word .
&quot; the period of approval for the subsidies has been running since January 1 , 2017 until April 30 , 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; until September of this year , however , it would only be possible to take stock , as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the sentence should be made as far as possible , so that the re@@ struc@@ tions can begin in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann explained that every municipality had to carry out the said preliminary examinations . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to assess and decide the conditions of urban development , when it is rehabil@@ itated and to what extent . &quot;
&quot; for the respective plot of land , there will be also a renovation mem@@ o in the land register . &quot;
&quot; once again , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come to sens@@ ations again and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ zel pointed out , that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants . &quot;
therefore there will be questionna@@ ires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and land arch &quot; , &quot; with which it is possible , among other things , about the structural condition and the renovation plans . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; H@@ ous@@ ehold and H@@ ousing &quot; , &quot; information about size , layout and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
&quot; the blue &quot; &quot; arc &quot; &quot; is to be filled only if the premises are operated in the building . &quot;
&quot; however , Got@@ zel pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible for funding . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ in@@ dler emphas@@ ised that the distribution of subsidies after the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; func@@ tioned first . &quot;
you can &apos;t reserve funds for later . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Ort@@ ner II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the attendance &quot; tasty . &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to get into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and foref@@ inger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology is similar to a cat and a dog im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks at houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra charge of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
the married father of one now has installed both at home and at his BMW Z@@ 4 technology which begins when his hand is at the wheel .
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American production last month , co@@ sting tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military , left to TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tr@@ ump , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter , made in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , was exhibited beside a Ma@@ ine , a fire engine from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a forkli@@ ft from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House Military Bureau demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event his superior , the deputy commander of aviation . &quot;
&quot; the news showed that the helicopter met on the South La@@ wn for the event at 3 p.m. on July 17th , and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening . &quot;
&quot; note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second crew for the return flight would be required due to the limitation of the service hours . &quot;
&quot; the original air@@ crew was during the event with the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time . &quot;
&quot; from the recordings provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second crew was required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act forbi@@ ds federal employees to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 has asked whether the event could harm destiny .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts , and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; wrote the commander . &quot;
&quot; sounds like you &apos;re closed , &quot; answered the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the President gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for travel .
but to demand their use only for a photo @-@ operation is unusual .
&quot; Tr@@ ump carried out an investigation in February when the president &apos;s plane was in front of the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential gate by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; Made In America &quot; - the products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently conduct training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to susp@@ end US President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; when Tr@@ ump was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 held 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event included the training needs of the crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; in addition , helicop@@ ters flew 11 hours this day for &quot; non @-@ presidential support missions . &quot; &quot;
the White House said the tax@@ pa@@ yers assumed the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man from Si@@ kor@@ sky said the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter to the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the US Department of Defence for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
unit records record the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter lies far below this rate .
&quot; &quot; &quot; determining the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in annual funding . &quot;
&quot; according to a 2015 RA@@ ND study , Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicop@@ ters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to emphasize this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear whether Tr@@ ump was inter@@ acting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire engine . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tr@@ ump spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and j@@ oked with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; said the president , &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss before tricky task
the leader of the Second World Tennis Bundes@@ liga will join the championship third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC Blue @-@ Weiss Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the stand@@ ings in Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; despite the five games still flaw@@ less , the top rider of the Second World Tennis Championships has maintained the sense of reality . &quot;
&quot; in any case , team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent . &quot;
&quot; this is a compact team , always playing in quite similar formation . &quot;
especially at the back positions I find the team very good . &quot;
&quot; for class and stability at the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , mainly imports from the high north . &quot;
&quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to bets on the Davis Cup .
&quot; they are also strong in doubles , &quot; &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas B@@ jer@@ swi@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; that will be difficult for us as always . &quot;
&quot; you also need a good dose of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ ess .
&quot; if the Fren@@ ch@@ man currently still active in the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella tournament , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec comes to his first use in this season . &quot;
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Cas@@ tillo was yesterday with the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should also be involved in Kiel , as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories against the Club at the Al@@ ster last Sunday , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could once again move into the team . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 year old Hungary , who in January 2016 was the number one of the Junior World Ranking List , not , someone fills up the cad@@ re from the train@@ ee staff around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay . &quot;
how America can hurt O@@ MV
Donald Tr@@ ump was not really happy when he put his signature under the law on the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , &quot; he et@@ ched a few &quot; constitutional provisions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels hur@@ led against the U.S. initiative . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft envis@@ ages pun@@ ishing European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from the O@@ MV ( O@@ MV ) have been worried about the construction of the Russian Eastern Partnership Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies . &quot;
the dr@@ ink@@ age is enormous .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an app@@ rais@@ al of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tr@@ ump himself would have to raise the sanctions by Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has looked at which the corporation could rep@@ el , and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Staff@@ el 3 trailer : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el will be placed at the centre of the charts of Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second squ@@ ad@@ ron of Nar@@ cos , who reveals Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Killer , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the ech@@ el@@ ons three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , the DE@@ A has directed its attention to the rich@@ est organization of the world &apos;s drug trade : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful sponsors , they &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 enterprise &quot; operate with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ ca@@ zar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ac@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Ja@@ vier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement agencies to support the war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry C@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third squ@@ ad@@ ron of Nar@@ cos will begin on September 1st .
R@@ ole backwards : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city re@@ organis@@ es the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and an assignment to the team .
the clock is turned back in the city day care centers .
&quot; on September 1 , the town of Kre@@ feld takes over food supplies in the municipal day@@ care facilities ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , Deputy Head of the Department for Youth Services , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooking will continue except house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and delivers fresh cooked ch@@ illed .
&quot; in the Kre@@ feld area , the city operates 46 day@@ care centers in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; last year , there were 28@@ 00 children sitting at the tables , and the need is constantly growing . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , not only children who are cared for in 45 days of the week , lunch at the K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ ance . &quot;
the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour reception if children stay until 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 part @-@ time forces have kitchen service from 1 September onwards : they warm up the food delivered , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , portions the meal individually , rinse off , rinse and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a &quot; &quot; K@@ ita &quot; , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ ance . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven group units - decides about the size of the ho@@ ur@@ ly .
&quot; the kitchen assistants are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; Pom@@ mer@@ ía says . &quot;
&quot; they are much more involved , and it is easier for the hospital to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
for this reason it is also about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleaning of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen forces - is settled by special cleaning staff in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also has the charm that it turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign lending for the city , it is said of the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , though 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured . &quot;
&quot; but these hours are not so heavy with about 750 people in the field of education , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afgh@@ an democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
three women candidate for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and be included in all parts of the election process .
the elections for the provincial council and the presidential election will take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban has published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat actions to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , for the first time , the elections will be handed over to the next government peac@@ efully by a democr@@ atically elected government . &quot;
Hay@@ dn said a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
&quot; the Afgh@@ an Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women of total registered 3,@@ 6 million voters are registered . &quot;

men try to ro@@ b 13 @-@ year old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to depri@@ ve a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
&quot; according to the police , the men told the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße against 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s cell phone . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , which , however , failed . &quot;
&quot; without loo@@ t , the duo fled . &quot;
the two young men were subsequently arrested by the police .
the investigations are underway .
G@@ MB ap@@ pre@@ h@@ ensive about investments in the Mc@@ Vi@@ beast factory in Glas@@ gow
a trade union wants to ensure the long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glas@@ gow over the long @-@ term commitment to manufacturing bis@@ cuit manufacturers Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company had been silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the factory , which alongside other products produces Hob@@ s@@ bs and Rich Tea Kett@@ le . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner pla@@ dis said he invested over 5 million pounds in recent years . &quot;
he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; first experience &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s shop manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s urge &quot; &quot; to express concerns that funding for modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can &apos;t win clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ a by the general site manager is deeply concerned with our members . &quot;
&quot; generations of families have worked here and the workforce focus strongly on the local community and Glas@@ gow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , from the perspective of jobs , wage and prosperity , and against the backdrop of the Bre@@ x@@ it , rising cost of living and chronic production decline , the Eastern end of Glas@@ gow is desper@@ ately demanding a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the director at T@@ oll@@ a has only received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this because we value the continued commitment among employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were discussed openly . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are constantly checking our business - and that applies to all our business units and locations - in order to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ a site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ a as a production facility . if our operations change at the site , employees and their union representatives will be the first to learn this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn against N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La League may have regre@@ t@@ ted her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in their persecution by N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not be indul@@ ged in following an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million to release its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years before the record of the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Lig@@ ue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pog@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after the termination , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional athlete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages from more than 500@@ ,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catalan Executive Board insi@@ sts that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president before this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a severe warning for every club that wanted to sign one of PS@@ G &apos;s best players . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish club expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid @-@ field player Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circum@@ stance , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter dis@@ car@@ ded and damaged
&quot; in the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown offen@@ ders had intentionally dropped a sco@@ oter in the royal field street in front of the property number 30 and caused damage to the vehicle &apos;s disgu@@ ise of more than 200 Euros . &quot;
&quot; the police , Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for hints . &quot;
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because a car met him in his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ red the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um with his VW arrived at the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the outskirts of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to meet him in his lane , so that he had to escape to the right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the guard rail . &quot;
&quot; on the passenger car , there was no damage . &quot;
&quot; the driver of the coming passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without wor@@ rying about the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident report , it can be good that the cycl@@ ist did not notice the accident at all . &quot;
&quot; the police are now asking for witnesses of the incident , as well as the driver of the judgment vehicle , to contact the In@@ spec@@ tor in Stol@@ zen@@ au on tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 . &quot;
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the abuse cases reli@@ eves Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this is what author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann says .
the final report on the abuse scandal at Regensburg &apos;s Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussion .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; declared after publication opposite the German Press Agency , he was an ap@@ ology from former Regensburg bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as the Canon Bishop Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI . &quot;
&quot; it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own la@@ yo@@ ffs or their false app@@ rais@@ al of the processes at that time . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen plant was measured with &quot; double standards . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in view of the attacks in Regensburg nobody doubts that it is a matter of &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts &quot; that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation &quot; is striking , such as the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ lin@@ ia , Histori@@ an and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics Committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ev@@ ils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion of keeping it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ lin@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis also said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; you love to go to the church and this is a dev@@ our@@ ing food . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth , &quot; &quot; pun@@ ches were a very normal educational means , &quot; &quot; to cope with nau@@ ghty children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it would be unfair to apply today &apos;s standards to earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports of the abuse cases , pop@@ e brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; the author and historian Michael Hes@@ eb@@ emann , who auth@@ ored the memory tape &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) , is completely wrong . &quot;
&quot; I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ sian , &quot; &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg ?
&quot; between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , 5@@ 47 Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were subjected to &quot; high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; in summary , it can be said that in many cases Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister R. was used in many cases of physical and mental violence . &quot;
&quot; especially in the case of high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could be more severe . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , unlike many other defend@@ ants , many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , may even associate positive memories with him in numerous cases . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ eb@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reli@@ eved his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ eb@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence against violence in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; &quot; gives a contradictory picture of Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students emphasize his &quot; &quot; humanity &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a ch@@ oline @-@ cler@@ k and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more pal@@ p@@ able if a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you regard this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael E@@ atz@@ inger : if you do the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is at all in it . &quot;
he is specifically devoted to eight pages and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or complic@@ ity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school were also ex@@ propri@@ ated outside of its sphere of influence .
&quot; he can at best repro@@ ach him , to know from it too late , or to have taken first hints seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um , on which he worked , was perceived by virtually all the respon@@ dents as - literally &quot; &quot; salvation &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the broad majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very excellent testimony , &quot; &quot; warm hearted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; competent &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; understanding &quot; , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher , who regularly nour@@ ished the boys with cakes , biscuits and sweets and &quot; always moved from grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to acute out@@ breaks . &quot;
&quot; he himself had promised , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the fact that he did not only s@@ nu@@ ggle with chairs and threw the keys on the ground , but also put ear @-@ files into the hair or ears , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for it . &quot;
&quot; it must be noted , however , that such educational methods were widespread in the question@@ able time between the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as with teachers . &quot;
do you know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced it in a secular school , a state gym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what actually happens in this report , namely the app@@ alling sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , this is certainly Bag@@ at@@ ella . &quot;
&quot; one wonders whether it is not more familiar with his or her role as brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media have just r@@ ushed on him . &quot;
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report rele@@ as@@ ers Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every way !
&quot; in the media , in connection with the report , there was a great deal about abuse in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger will also be charged with any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse ? &quot;
Michael H@@ emann : clearly no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have trusted the Cathedral master .
not even the parents were dedicated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said a concerned representative for the others , &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing was very embarrass@@ ing for me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse , however , is that most victims are silent . &quot;
&quot; if they did not even trust parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir director , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators for a certain time . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of abuse ?
Michael H@@ emann : a question@@ able student put it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had had timely re@@ aliz@@ ations and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I consider it ... even for really absurd to assume that counted on him ... boys are more intru@@ sive or clearer or more likely to have opened than to their parents , boarding managers , trust teachers , etc . &quot;
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the report concludes with a clear conclusion : &quot; &quot; in the run @-@ up to the students and / or their environment , they could not be confirmed in the examination . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is therefore acqu@@ itted of any co @-@ worker . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to display . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to link its good name to these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it happens in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , much of &quot; &quot; Viol@@ ence Ex@@ cess &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former Cathedral master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; . &quot; &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael H@@ emann : it &apos;s the big problem that everything mixes and ming@@ les in the reporting , and has become a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but this is a mis@@ use of the report .
&quot; there is a clean separation : between the pre @-@ school and the gym@@ nasi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence and , we say , other alle@@ gations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report treats incidents from the time since 1945 , i.e. also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral head of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; all the terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys from sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were down@@ right ch@@ imed and painted , all of them had to go to the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have reigned . &quot;
&quot; but with those , Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got his face when she was already at the Dom@@ sp@@ atz@@ eng@@ ym@@ nasi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on this , as most witnesses stress , the subject &quot; primary school &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac &quot; conditions .
what was different at the grammar school ?
&quot; Michael H@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many sacrifices have estimated the general humanity of R. and , in numerous cases , even positively associate positive memories with him . &quot;
at most it remains the repro@@ ach to have looked away .
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then back in 1993 . &quot;
spar@@ se Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently scre@@ am his ears before the states ?
&quot; Michael E@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atz gym@@ nasi@@ um , which the report was even reproduced . &quot;
he points out to the fact that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool the punishment will continue to be practi@@ sed .
&quot; even in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; this was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was passed when testing pen@@ alties were also banned in Bavaria for a long time . &quot;
&quot; before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as each one of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to estimate where those affected might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the permitted limit had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; however , one cannot say that he had always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , it was officially abol@@ ished in schools in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis said , &quot; &quot; It is unfair to apply today &apos;s pedago@@ gical standards to the time at that time . &quot;
how do you see that ?
&quot; Michael H@@ emann : we are talking about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of evaluating the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
the princess is already right .
&quot; but this is not true of sexual abuse , which was ab@@ hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous at all times and also not for what was shed in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond the usual practice . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s all aw@@ ful , and I &apos;m glad that it will finally be worked out . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , I must take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; in the 1970s , his means of discipl@@ ining and punishment were widespread in the 197@@ 0@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; as a physical punishment , he was also strictly adher@@ ed to . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Regensburg time has Georg R@@ atz@@ inger played with you in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My Brother the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of test punishment also come to language ?
&quot; Michael H@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not at all hide that he led a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; but this also has to be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without claiming unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the rather nation@@ ally known Regensburg Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with cookies and sweets alone , the rebel@@ li@@ ous boy does not make a big singer and stand before every success , no matter which area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of person do you have experienced by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks with her book ?
&quot; Michael E@@ atz@@ inger : through work on the book and in addition , I have met Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful , hum@@ orous , basic , deep believing and heart@@ felt people , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something for a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly get in touch with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ tierung , regularly keep contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who have not forgiven him until now , that he was once stern to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he always was a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , sure , that may be - but also a lov@@ able respect , to which they still look and rever@@ e them . &quot;
&quot; and please , once again clearly : all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just to make a man , just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
the evil intent behind it is only too obvious .
&quot; the report , which was just published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the propri@@ ety area , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who has acquired great mer@@ its and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally settle in peace . &quot;
