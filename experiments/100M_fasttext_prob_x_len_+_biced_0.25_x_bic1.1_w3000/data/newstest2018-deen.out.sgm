<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four maps that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren hospital where young people are to meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A pit chapel that is now excavated for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Gardeners farm the former ground of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">Munich's oldest official map promotes exciting stories for days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets annoying when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the car navigation device showed a green glade instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bavaria-atlas, an offer of the geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but topical - but precisely therefore very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bavaria-Atlas is a patchwork that one cannot recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large overview map was incorporated into more detailed maps for cities and municipalities, so-called" "original position papers". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying business between 1810 and 1864 and from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your client: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the French army leader occupied Bavaria since early 1800, during the Second Coalition War with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographic record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801, it was the neighbours today who created the idea of a nationwide map of Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV. Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian surveying business."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the composition sheet for Munich dates back to the year 1856, and is to be found on the website of the Bavarian State Library."</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison earlier / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded into all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is Untersendling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was convened 21 years after the creation of the map, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is located in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße, which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where the Westpark is today, one sees nothing as fields - at first glance: when zooming a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwritten numbered pieces of land from the so-called" "primitive instalation" "from which the land tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">Small parcels now do not occupy farmers anymore - but small gardeners of the "land in the sun."</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"the Theresienwiese, the scene of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the original position, in the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "on Gasteig" "or from the hill" "On the ventilation" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße one once locked people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59 the Munich District Irrenanstalt" "On the Auer Lüftedness" "was created there."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and for example ended the knocking of the so-called Irren.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he also prohibited the personnel to use force against detainees," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, who worked for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients first place was first, later it was expanded to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">At some point this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chalk pension in Haar in 1905.</seg>
<seg id="39">"since 2006, the Isar Amper Hospital Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum on the grounds of the former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth shelter with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football field of the TSV München East, East dwellings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was erected in an architectural style to the original building of the Irrenau, which was destroyed during the Second World War in bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed as the main square in 1856, the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allied bombs broke many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A large remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a chapel chapel from the Middle Ages were once situated at the Marienhof, where the preliminary work and the groundbreaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn station took place on 5 April 2017."</seg>
<seg id="49">"with the slider, you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof."</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group publishes tour warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Association for Colors has issued a warning for coloured people who are travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks on the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force by August 28, 2017, urges Afro-American travellers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention while travelling through the state, as a number of questionable, racial-based incidents occur in the entire state and are noted here," "says the Group."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently passed law by Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to win discrimination complaints, as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state who are disproportionate to minorities, led the group to release the warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of the civil rights that happen to humans.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more gasoline during the journey and was taken into custody by the Missouri police, without being accused of a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report of the Office of Missouri Attorney General, showing that black motorists in the state will be 75 percent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri," said Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">People have to be willing to accept deposits or let relatives know that they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime report, listing the state with regard to the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">The warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to accuse a company because of housing or employment discrimination.</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had passed immigration laws that local law enforcement authorities are committed to arrest people because of immigration violations, which will contribute to further race recognition in the opinion of the ACLU."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently interest groups have deployed the measure as a response to specific laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The fishing village Weideviln project is a successful project and will continue next year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of parliament Peter White and Kordula Kovac provided a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the Schwendemann family court yard, representatives of the Fishermen's CDU-village association met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first provided insights into his farm, in which he farms 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and accommodates in five apartments Feriengaeste."</seg>
<seg id="72">"for him the" "Black Forest" "is the alternative channel for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">On the table of the Feriengäste exclusively regional.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since he is also the chairman of Fisherbach's BLHV, he described the electric fence project as" elementary. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profit on such steep faces.</seg>
<seg id="76">The grassland provision for a lot of work and much has to be worked on with the brushcutter.</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," said Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental farm and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it did not lead a bioeconomy."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognised the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the promotion of leaders. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">I hope so that the afforestation of the faces could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts about how they carry on their business," "emphasised the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">"because of the promotion, farmers are often in the criticisms"</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots were fenced off by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the disclosure area is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be forested by at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of €71 million, half was promoted by leaders, a quarter bearing the municipality of Fisherbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers had to invest 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in a pasture fence of 16.2 kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the big advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you are doing a really good job without farmers and rural women."</seg>
<seg id="90">Peter White also noted: "best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The landscape care guidelines (LPR) Baden-Württemberg will enable the state support of pasture fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to keep the Black Forest open.</seg>
<seg id="93">The assumption of full take-up tends to exaggerate the simulated increase in caseloads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform.</seg>
<seg id="94">"moreover, the enclosed area must not be smuppered (inclination over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"the request of eight participants with 24 pitches, which is almost 16 kilometres of fence, is currently underway for the 2018 Fishermen's Electric Vehicle launch project."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more holy?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on the Fira Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the President's proposals for drastic reduction of legal migration to the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to remain fair, Miller grabbed the statue himself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have nched him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he took on their meaning, and especially the importance that was attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta," I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is improperly correct, but as he put it himself, it's not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state not only invites some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your arms, your oppressed masses who long to breathe freely, and the miserable waste of your rich shores. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable garbage" was better to see on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trumpet USA are not welcome.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict: it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus - and her friends, who sat down to place their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they had accomplished a highly political action."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classic portrayal.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the Exilants.</seg>
<seg id="116">The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American naativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and exactly as Lazarus has changed the significance of the statue, people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anybody, but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame into the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty continues. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">"quite unusual, Limbaugh has stumbled upon something here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The significance of the statue is entirely a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see her as she was seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the truest sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch will not enlighten the way, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black sings Scottish members of the Great Britain Team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two Scotties belonged to the team of Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the UK's Athletics Games, Neil Black, says that the 16-piece Scottish contingent in the world cup competition will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">"a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London in 2017, starting on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland something special is developed" "and the athletics of the UK have to learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will continue it until we find out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butt - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team to captain the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"Eilidh is rather modest.</seg>
<seg id="141">"her speech was incredible," says Black. "</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great.</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in her fifth World Championships at the 400 m hurdles, says it is" "incredible" "that 16 Scottish people are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The central aisle runner Muir goes on this path and last year set up five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runners."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch after a great season, which included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell was.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also medals and finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammers voted for me and chosen me makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I'm very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes who want to rise to podiums."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to put on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Block critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you can't tolerate the heat-up of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something from bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"Americans loved George Washington, but it did not take long for the papers to beat him for everything, from domestic politics to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he shrank in criticism, certainly."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he has not silenced his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, silly and mute, we are led like sheep to slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"that brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan, who needs to work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union accused him of this at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the Governor's staff dismissed the complaint as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is especially important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary hothead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very clever in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and to debug his hairless head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons who come to the governor's side - which is a public forum designated as officially and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan's spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the Governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hate-filled people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post was talking to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only true people who speak with their elected leaders: a teacher, a businessman and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profound."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the commentary box "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not appreciate this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject, and some of them are rather disregarded as a collective employment rather than a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">What the Governor's employees labeled as "concentrated spam attacks" would probably call others "intercession."</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook Era simply makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or cancelling a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles and to arrest and silence demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that's exactly what happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">Twitter users are sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County wounded the First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This shouldn't be so hard.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable portos had a similar effect on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters hit on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had an anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people using pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote letters to the newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"criticised his position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with the UK, his ministry was overwhelmed, according to historical documents collected by the online Papers of the George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not silence her.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses form the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true leadership means accepting that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days, as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>

<seg id="213">This is a great showcase for this course. "</seg>
<seg id="214">"the Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, even though he won the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32-year career."</seg>
<seg id="215">"that really feels special," said the player based in Southport. "</seg>
<seg id="216">I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it.</seg>

<seg id="219">"the memories of last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year."</seg>

<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more when you're playing at home," "said Orr, the man of Helensburgh."</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also feel that extra pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I'm glad how it went so far.</seg>

<seg id="233">Scientists from the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf (UKE) come to this conclusion in a study.</seg>
<seg id="234">"according to our estimates, 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking per year," said Professor Heiko Becher. "</seg>
<seg id="235">"as a comparison, he drew up his own study on this topic from 1994."</seg>
<seg id="236">"at that time, there were still 400 lung cancer deaths due to passive smoking per year in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="237">The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health.</seg>
<seg id="238">Domestic inclusions prove to be very complex</seg>
<seg id="239">"the construction works in the Villinger Strasse are in full swing and" are reasonably in time, "says the Head of the Station Fred Heinze."</seg>
<seg id="240">"in the area of domestic connections, the situation is more complicated than assumed, since there is a lot of hiding in the underground, which is not noted in the plans."</seg>
<seg id="241">"traffic, which always hinders construction work, is a major problem for Stumpp's construction company."</seg>
<seg id="242">"the ignorance of motorists in front of red lights and shut-off gates is enormous," "reports Heinze."</seg>
<seg id="243">The road is locked and only the regular buses are eligible for passage.</seg>
<seg id="244">"Angelo Caruso, Marvin Kotranz and Tim Kotranz from Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks."</seg>
<seg id="245">"the hot days were already quite exhausting.</seg>
<seg id="246">"but luckily we were provided with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt," says Marvin Kotranz. "</seg>
<seg id="247">Poverty and death in the Indonesian gold country</seg>
<seg id="248">"when Bardina Degei cooks dinner, she does not use a stove."</seg>
<seg id="249">It even rarely uses a pot.</seg>
<seg id="250">"in her wooden house in Enarotali, the capital of the Paniai Regentship in the unsettled Indonesian province of Papua, the housewife usually places a sweet potato - locally called" nota "- directly in the fireplace."</seg>
<seg id="251">"after half an hour, the carbonized tuber is removed and swallowed with zealous, unwashed hands."</seg>
<seg id="252">"Degei sits on the clay ground - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work, such as clothes with murky water from the nearby swamp."</seg>
<seg id="253">A bucket in a homeless room serves as a latrine.</seg>
<seg id="254">"as the youngest of the four wives of her husband, no fields were assigned to her."</seg>
<seg id="255">Polygamy is common here.</seg>
<seg id="256">"of course it can be dangerous to work late: most of the villagers are unemployed, and many drink hard and there are soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="257">"no one dares to run around in the village after 5pm," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="258">"it is a rare insight into the daily life in the highlands of Papua, a former Dutch colony that was recorded in 1969 following a controversial referendum in Indonesia, when only 1,026 elders should vote by a public lift in front of the occupying forces."</seg>
<seg id="259">"an existing movement, which stirred up the independence of the Dutch government, quickly turned against the government of Jakarta, which entertains control of the region and excludes foreign journalists or observers."</seg>
<seg id="260">"in 2003, the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua, where the independent part of Papua New Guinea took part in the eastern part of the island."</seg>
<seg id="261">The trip includes a 90 minute flight from the provincial capital Jayapura to Nabire and then a morning 5-hour drive with the rental car.</seg>
<seg id="262">There is no public transport.</seg>
<seg id="263">"the city, with about 19,000 inhabitants, consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fence and of corrugated sheets converted by rust into different yellow-brown tones."</seg>
<seg id="264">"very few Indonesians made their trip here, let alone journalists and practically no foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="265">"before Christian missionaries arrived, Mee Pago Papuan adored a god named Uga Tamee."</seg>
<seg id="266">There were also other changes.</seg>
<seg id="267">"we were not used to wearing these clothes," says Degei and points to her lively, handwoven turban, dark shirt and her bright skirt. "</seg>
<seg id="268">"in the past, we had only leaves on our bodies."</seg>
<seg id="269">"Papua is Indonesia's poorest province, where 28% of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst infra-mortality and literacy rates in Asia."</seg>
<seg id="270">But it is also Indonesia's Goldland.</seg>
<seg id="271">"the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world, Grass Mountain, owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix, is only 60 miles from Paniai, a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="272">"in 2015 alone, Freeport accounted for $3.1 billion of gold and copper."</seg>
<seg id="273">"in addition, Papua disposes of wood resources valued at estimated $78 billion."</seg>
<seg id="274">"these riches, however, are a source of misery for the Papua that ensures that Indonesia's powerful military keeps a suffocating presence."</seg>
<seg id="275">"an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $20 million in local military units and units between 1998 and 2004, including up to 150,000 US dollars to a single officer."</seg>
<seg id="276">Papuan demands for greater autonomy threaten this golden goose and are ruthlessly treated.</seg>
<seg id="277">"according to activists, more than 500,000 Papua people have been killed and thousands have been raped, tortured and imprisoned in 1969 by the Indonesian military."</seg>
<seg id="278">"mass killings in Papuas's tribal highland in the 1970s, according to the Asia Human Rights Commission, were committed to genocide."</seg>
<seg id="279">"in the region alone, the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year."</seg>
<seg id="280">"we" "streak all things" "in a report by the archdiocese of Brisbane from 2016, which reports about atrocities in the previous year, such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electrical strikes are particularly popular according to another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations."</seg>
<seg id="281">"it is difficult to count the number of victims each week," says Andreas Harsono, Indonesia Researcher for Human Rights Watch. "</seg>
<seg id="282">"the bolts have strengthened, as Papuas resources bring about an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia."</seg>
<seg id="283">"the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83% Christian, but demographic development is changing since Muslim economic migrants from the populated islands of Java, Borneo, Sumatra and Sulawesi come."</seg>
<seg id="284">"Javanese warung canteens sell fried chicken and gado gado, a mixed vegetables with peanut sauce served."</seg>
<seg id="285">Local people are fighting to keep up here.</seg>
<seg id="286">"the migrants have started selling chickens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than the local Papua," says Abeth You, a 24-year old Paniai indigenous who moved to the province capital Jayapura. "</seg>
<seg id="287">"it has cost the native Papua, the Mama-Mom [the women] of Papua - their market."</seg>
<seg id="288">"during his campaign in 2014, Indonesian President Joko Widodo, popularly known as Joko Widodo, promised to address inequalities and legal violations in Papua."</seg>
<seg id="289">The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="290">"but in Papua, little has changed, and today the locals feel betrayed."</seg>
<seg id="291">"our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Joko, with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored," "says You."</seg>
<seg id="292">"in fact, Paniai suffered a low point only two months after Joko's initiation in October."</seg>
<seg id="293">"on December 7, 2014, a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a campfire in Enarotali, when two Indonesian soldiers broke on a motorcycle through the darkness."</seg>
<seg id="294">The frightened children told them that they should switch on their headlights.</seg>
<seg id="295">"one of the soldiers fired her tone and later returned with four soldiers, so the local pastor Yavedt Tebai."</seg>
<seg id="296">"the soldiers who had drunk, hunted and struck the group with their rifle butts, said victims and witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="297">Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children.</seg>
<seg id="298">"a child, 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo, was severely beaten to fall into the coma."</seg>
<seg id="299">A few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escalated the next day.</seg>
<seg id="300">"about 1,000 young people, women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice."</seg>
<seg id="301">They carried ceremonial hunting bends and performed the Waita dance - in the circle continuously and imitating a bird song - from Papuas Mee Pago tribe.</seg>
<seg id="302">Some demonstrators began to spin stones at police and military posts.</seg>
<seg id="303">"when the mood was heated, the soldiers were sent a command over an internal radio:" if the masses resist more than three times, they shoot them dead, "says it in an official TIME document that was not released to the local media."</seg>
<seg id="304">"Yeremias Kayame, 56, the leader of the Kego Koto-district of Enarotali, saw the threatening danger and called for peace and called on the crowd to return home."</seg>
<seg id="305">Nobody was listening to the mood.</seg>
<seg id="306">"when I turned around, I was suddenly shot in my left wrist," he said TIME on the porch of his multicolored painted wood house. "</seg>
<seg id="307">"Kayak still does not know who has fired, but says that the ball from the ranks of the assembled soldiers came."</seg>
<seg id="308">"it was crowded, many shots were fired," "he adds."</seg>
<seg id="309">"the native man Alfius Youm was hit three times, according to his cousin, the witness of the executions."</seg>
<seg id="310">"I ran to him and examined his body to make sure he was," "said Yohanes, who, like many Indonesians, only carries a name, the TIME in gloomy mood."</seg>
<seg id="311">I saw that he was dead... I kissed him.</seg>
<seg id="312">"the chief spector of the Papua police, Yotje Mende, reporters said that his officers wanted to" secure "their station because they were being attacked."</seg>
<seg id="313">"we must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us," said Commissioner of the Papua police commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo, in 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="314">"it's about life and death."</seg>
<seg id="315">"according to Human Rights Watch, five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured."</seg>
<seg id="316">The news on the killings was "filtered" only the following day after Jakarta.</seg>
<seg id="317">"in Jayapura, Jokowi held a passionate speech for three weeks in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swelled to tackle the historic grievances in Papua."</seg>
<seg id="318">"I want this case to be solved immediately, so that it will no longer happen in the future," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="319">"in October 2016, Minister of Security, Wiranto, said that he would advocate an out-of-court mechanism for the settlement of historic human rights violations."</seg>
<seg id="320">But the excuses began almost immediately.</seg>
<seg id="321">"most injuries occurred a long time ago.</seg>
<seg id="322">Some were in the 90-ern and beginning of the 2000-s.</seg>
<seg id="323">"the point is that we have committed ourselves to address these violations, but there are processes that must be traversed," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="324">"then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on June 5, and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua."</seg>
<seg id="325">"instead, everything is regulated by law," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="326">"charged by the UN for" crimes against humanity, "which caused more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor's bloody independence referendum of 1999, Wiranto said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been settled, including the Paniai incident."</seg>
<seg id="327">Families of the Paniai victims received such claims with grimmed unbelief.</seg>
<seg id="328">"I have been interviewed four times over the last three years, but there have been no progress," says Yohanes. "</seg>
<seg id="329">"I'm tired."</seg>
<seg id="330">He says he still lives in fear years later.</seg>
<seg id="331">"I'm afraid," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="332">"I am afraid of being arrested by the military, afraid of being shot."</seg>
<seg id="333">His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that the people of Paniai were afraid to discuss the incident.</seg>
<seg id="334">He says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims.</seg>
<seg id="335">"after I buried the bodies, the military searched for me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="336">The gunfights have not ceased.</seg>
<seg id="337">"on Tuesday, the Indonesian police fired on villagers in Paniais neighborhood of Deiyai."</seg>
<seg id="338">"during a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company refusing to bring a man unconscious to the hospital, one person and 17 others were injured, including children."</seg>
<seg id="339">"the man, the 24-year old ravianus Douw, drowned when he fished in a nearby river, died on the way to the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="340">Excited groups of villagers protested in front of the company's office.</seg>
<seg id="341">The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing up warning shots.</seg>
<seg id="342">But locals say that the mobile brigade (Indonesian police) began shooting at the crowd and killed one.</seg>
<seg id="343">"we were in panic, we are afraid that revenge will be given," says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered, such as the TIME. "</seg>
<seg id="344">"I hid myself two days in my house."</seg>
<seg id="345">The Deiyai parliament has called on the officers to be held accountable and withdraw the police's mobile brigade.</seg>
<seg id="346">Paniai was always a troublemaker for the Indonesian government.</seg>
<seg id="347">"the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the clan members Mee, Moni, Dani and Damal, who live in the green highlands of Papua."</seg>
<seg id="348">"many of them joined the" Free Papua Movement "(OPM), the rebel army, claiming to defend the rights of Papua by attacking sporadic attacks and kidnappings by Indonesian soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="349">"some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai, among them Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yuden Kogoya."</seg>
<seg id="350">"in response to this, thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in custody under the pretext of" safeguarding national sovereignty. ""</seg>
<seg id="351">Some never pop up again.</seg>
<seg id="352">"among the people of Papua, Paniai is known as a" "tragic, forgotten place". ""</seg>
<seg id="353">Poverty boosts dissatisfaction.</seg>
<seg id="354">The little rice that is sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals.</seg>
<seg id="355">Bread is just as out of reach.</seg>
<seg id="356">People here build everything they eat: especially nota and fruit and leafy vegetables.</seg>
<seg id="357">"agriculture is the task of women, who can process four or five fields of sweet potato."</seg>
<seg id="358">They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market.</seg>
<seg id="359">"ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees (75 cents)."</seg>
<seg id="360">"over time, economic inequalities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown, which have arrived in greater numbers since the launch of new routes to the Nabire airport."</seg>
<seg id="361">"as a rule, the few jobs that exist in the region go to the better educated and well-to-do migrants."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in other words, they rarely have the capital or the necessary skills in order to make their own companies competitive."</seg>
<seg id="363">"the young people are not interested in staying in the village... for there is no jobs or money," says John Gobai, the chairman of the panel board of Paniai. "</seg>
<seg id="364">Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua.</seg>
<seg id="365">"in addition, international media coverage remains tense."</seg>
<seg id="366">"at the beginning of the year, French journalists Franck Escudas and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua because of the lack of coordination with related institutions, although the rare permission was given to them for filming."</seg>
<seg id="367">"according to Phelim Kine, the deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch, the promises of Joko's election campaign to raise the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized."</seg>
<seg id="368">"there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report Indonesia's unsettled eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua: visa refusal and a black list," "he said in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread violations "in Papua including the Paniai shooting."</seg>
<seg id="371">The same countries have historically supported the OPM.</seg>
<seg id="372">"the spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Arrmanatha Nasir, rejected the Group's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta:" "in Indonesia, there is still a democratic system and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights violations."</seg>
<seg id="373">Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this.</seg>
<seg id="374">"when an official delegation from the Netherlands, headed by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar, Jayapura, visited Jayapura on 4 May, local people broke their silence and urged him" We want freedom, "according to a source that also participated in the meeting, but wants to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="375">"Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019, but the Papua claims that they will probably not vote again for Jokowi."</seg>
<seg id="376">"Joko is a man who has good intentions, but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots," says Gobai, the chairman of the stock market. "</seg>
<seg id="377">"he wants to know that the Paniai people know that the Paniai people, apart from being under the constant threat of a predatory military, are in poor educational and health services."</seg>
<seg id="378">"Gobai says that the Paniai people, like other Papua, consider their voice for Joko as a" guilt "he has to pay back."</seg>
<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they want just justice," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="380">"despite the threats and intimidation, families of the Paniai-gunmen carried out a last symbolic act of defiance: the corpse of a victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station."</seg>
<seg id="381">"they know that they might never come to justice, but at least they don't let those responsible forget their crimes."</seg>
<seg id="382">"a member of our family was killed," says Yacobus with a lowered head. "</seg>
<seg id="383">"what else can we do?"</seg>
<seg id="384">Fire capturing the 'Torch' skyscraper from Dubai for the second time</seg>
<seg id="385">"a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest dwellings in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337-metre-high, 79-storey buildings."</seg>
<seg id="386">"it is the second fire that sweeps through the high-rise in just two years, which is accidentally called the Torch Tower (Fackel Tower)."</seg>
<seg id="387">"the building was evacuated, injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame."</seg>
<seg id="388">"we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the cries of the people.</seg>

<seg id="390">Dubai's civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units were extinguishing the fire at 4.00 p.m. local time (00.00 GMT) and cooling the building.</seg>
<seg id="391">The government said it is working on providing accommodation to those affected.</seg>
<seg id="392">The incident can resurrect questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world.</seg>
<seg id="393">"an investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that the largest part of the damage from facing, the exterior cladding for decoration or insulation, came."</seg>
<seg id="394">"in Britain, the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cladding at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died."</seg>

<seg id="411">The most common objects that were purposely passed by TSA agents were food and liquids.</seg>
<seg id="412">"more than 3 percent claimed to have knowingly carried objects with blades by security control, while 2.2 percent of the female surveyed and 3.7 percent of the male respondents also confirmed that they had intentionally brought illegal drugs into the plane."</seg>

<seg id="421">Electrician Elon Musk enjoys the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla Model 3.</seg>
<seg id="422">"so far, he has been suggesting that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation."</seg>
<seg id="423">"alongside the constantly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Elon Musk has for the first time revealed a different, less glittering figure at the announcement of the latest quarterly balance sheet: the cancellation in the new mass market model 3."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in recent months, Musk frequently had more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car, whose delivery currently begins."</seg>
<seg id="425">"now, Musk admits: of the 518,000 pre-orders 63.000 have already been withdrawn."</seg>
<seg id="426">Critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are simply non-binding reservations.</seg>
<seg id="427">"in case of cancellation Tesla will pay the 1,000 euros (in the US $1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds)" "Reservation". ""</seg>

<seg id="429">"however, the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders up to now could be a problem."</seg>
<seg id="430">"his argument: the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not in demand, but on the production side."</seg>
<seg id="431">"last year, Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="432">"2018: all models will be taken together - 500,000, by 2020 one million."</seg>
<seg id="433">The demand for this is obviously there.</seg>
<seg id="434">"according to Musk, 1800 reservations are made per day."</seg>
<seg id="435">"if you order a" Model 3 "today, you can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines, which have never been tested in practice, with maximum capacity utilisation."</seg>
<seg id="436">Many experts doubt that this is possible.</seg>
<seg id="437">"but if there are too much delays, then the unbinding obligation of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla."</seg>

<seg id="440">"a day after he had been sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, resigned his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce the emissions of smog-causing air pollutants."</seg>
<seg id="441">"Pruitt presented the changes, when his agency proved to be responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations."</seg>
<seg id="442">He did not mention the complaint filed against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">It is about a period which expired on 1 October for states to comply with the 2015 standard ozone standards.</seg>
<seg id="444">"Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the observance of one year in order to give its authority more time to study the plan, and to avoid interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth."</seg>
<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who was named after his appointment by President Donald Trump Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma, was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection regulations for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="446">"since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed on to block or delay regulation, to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels continue to resist."</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the most recent legal setback for the Pruction Regarding rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, which obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30 pm."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius-complex is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the Sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village made the friends and patrons of turmoil to their concern.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasises: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergische Urjavík: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church on it, together with the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver. "</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the document of the document, apart from the former parish church, apart from the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard to which the church or the patronage belonged and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Freudenstadt Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen, the" mountain "is the third, the community centre of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the time around 1600 prove this historical situation.</seg>
<seg id="476">The privilege of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a master, who built a church, reared up and occupied with a priest, continued to remain the owner of this church and could also bequeath this own church."</seg>
<seg id="478">It was connected with the right to appoint a priest or to appoint a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two was shattered on Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but later had to be released in the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">During the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648) the window panes were inserted and the bell rings were stolen.</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaking.</seg>
<seg id="484">In 1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remnants of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumour Hilarius cemetery was also the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the church of Hilariuskirche was abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">"during the New Year's Eve in 1834, a storm split the church tower and half collapsed."</seg>
<seg id="491">"in order to prevent misfortune, the tower was broken down."</seg>
<seg id="492">"only the tower, which still exists today, was preserved as a witness to the 750 year old church history."</seg>
<seg id="493">"today, Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem care for Dieter Dockhorn's Hilarius-system as successor to Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>
<seg id="494">"as an organizer, the friends and promoters of Tumarc invite to the old cemetery in St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday, July 16, to the sixth serenade."</seg>
<seg id="495">It is designed by the Combo of Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis.</seg>
<seg id="496">Hartmut Romann speaks the closing word.</seg>
<seg id="497">The program starts at 4.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="498">Admission is from 3.30 p.m.</seg>
<seg id="499">"to conclude the serenade, a trunk takes place in front of the graveyard."</seg>
<seg id="500">"enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest," the organizers emphasize the fantastic view. "</seg>
<seg id="501">The serenade takes place only in dry weather.</seg>
<seg id="502">"the organizers are hoping for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hilarius plant, which is of great importance for tumors and listeners."</seg>
<seg id="503">The friends and patrons of Tumblitz are particularly committed to their home care as Serenade organiser Walter Martini reaffirms.</seg>

<seg id="505">"Boisheim refuses" sees no legal precondition for the construction and therefore has turned to the Councillor.</seg>
<seg id="506">The club "Boisheim fights" has called for Landrat Andreas Coenen (CDU) to take back its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette.</seg>
<seg id="507">It is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="508">"the association argues that at the time of approval no wind turbines could have been approved at the Boisheim Nette at the time of approval, as at the time in Viersen only at the city border to Schwalmtal there existed a wind power concentration zone."</seg>
<seg id="509">"in this concentration zone, construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible, but at the same time the concentration zone causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="510">"such zones are intended to prevent" "asparagus" "of the landscape."</seg>
<seg id="511">"only a few days before, the city of Viersen had decided a second wind turbine zone in the Nette Boisheim Nette by a change in the land use plan - but it had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf, because of an infant."</seg>
<seg id="512">"due to the lack of planning legal requirements, the granted permitting case is still illegal and therefore also withdraw," said Christoph Erkens, president of "Boisheim." "</seg>
<seg id="513">"current state of affairs: before the summer break, the city council has once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Nette of Boisheim; approval by the district government is still pending."</seg>
<seg id="514">"Erkens:" in this respect, the issuance of a permit for the establishment of wind power plants is legally precluded. "</seg>
<seg id="515">The circle confirms the entrance of the request.</seg>
<seg id="516">"the corresponding letter has been addressed by the circle of Viersen since last week," "declared a speaker."</seg>
<seg id="517">The circle takes them as an opportunity to examine the matter again.</seg>
<seg id="518">"however, they do not expect the proceedings to be stopped."</seg>
<seg id="519">"with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administrative Court, the circle on Thursday refused to comment on the argumentation of the association" Boisheim denied. ""</seg>
<seg id="520">"the NEW Re, a subsidiary of the NEW, is planning to build four 200-metre-high wind turbines on an area at the Boisheim hub."</seg>
<seg id="521">"last year, the company, in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved, had concluded lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65-hectare area."</seg>
<seg id="522">"with the construction of the four wind turbines, the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - that is roughly one-fifth of the electricity needs of all four-legged households."</seg>
<seg id="523">The NEW Re plans to invest some 20 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="524">Last summer Viersen's city council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the wind park Linnich near Aachen as well as a participation in a wind turbine plant in Übach-Palenberg in the district Heinsberg.</seg>

<seg id="687">"it is a beautiful, wide spectrum that I see here."</seg>

<seg id="698">I will start my studies in the social sciences in the winter semester.</seg>

<seg id="739">"the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has revoked a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration, which states that states are obliged to contain the smog-causing emissions. this took place one day after 15 states sued the agency because of the step."</seg>

<seg id="748">"in the end, the decision was clear: in two opposing voices, the municipal council of Fluorn-Wincles decides to set up a community room in the future seniors residence."</seg>
<seg id="749">"before the discussion, there is an important information: the purchase agreement for the still missing part of the land is signed, reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden."</seg>
<seg id="750">"although it will take some time for the area to be owned by the church community until now, there is no planning obstacle to the project stemming from a private investor."</seg>
<seg id="751">There is a discussion about a common room for this.</seg>
<seg id="752">One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to meet the community.</seg>
<seg id="753">"on the ground floor, it would provide a living space - around 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a total of 70 square meters for a special price."</seg>
<seg id="754">"the administration and the majority of the municipal council hovers to see such a common room as a meeting place only for the inhabitants of the senianism-just residential building, but openly in the community."</seg>
<seg id="755">"as an example, the word" "knitting café" "made the round."</seg>
<seg id="756">"the decision, which was pre-decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn, is made possible by funding opportunities."</seg>
<seg id="757">The building is in the renovation area.</seg>
<seg id="758">"the establishment of a community room would be, according to Tjaden, with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible for funding."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the proposal envisages to signal the investor that in this respect one does not want to throw a billet between the legs, stating that both the saddle - what is leaning against the surrounding construction - as well as the pitch roof - which reduces the tear height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible."</seg>
<seg id="760">"needless to say, Wilfried Sohmer is not referring to this additive."</seg>
<seg id="761">If it helps: unanimously he passes the committee.</seg>
<seg id="762">It's not that easy with the common room.</seg>
<seg id="763">"Daniela's call refers to the many of her own buildings, with which one does not move so well, but now they lean into the common room out of the window, she says:" I am struggling with it. "</seg>
<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger absolutely appeals to the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a covert subsidy to any asset or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">"this is not the case, because with the acquisition of the area there is no surplus, but I get a real equivalent value, in case of doubt, that is the counter-speech."</seg>
<seg id="767">Three advocates are advocated by the Staiger's request to submit the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="768">"that's how it stays with two opposing voices in the original programme that Stefan Haller sums up:" "if we believe the decision, we make a giant leap into close a huge gap in our infrastructure."</seg>

<seg id="803">"in a first phase by 2018, the association is planning" well-accessible installations at five to six locations "in Oberharz."</seg>
<seg id="804">"I would ask St. Andreasberg, Braunlage, Hohegeiß and Sieber."</seg>
<seg id="805">The information on the tables is to be supplemented by Internet.</seg>
<seg id="806">"for this reason, a good mobile network reception is a part of the site selection."</seg>
<seg id="807">Accessibility is also a criterion.</seg>
<seg id="808">"later, the train will be extended by train."</seg>
<seg id="809">"on the starbase, the viewer experiences a lot of interesting facts, for example on the physics of the individual stars," "explained the association."</seg>

<seg id="812">"since 2014, the association operates the highest located observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg."</seg>
<seg id="813">"according to the Federal Office for Nature Conservation, the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="814">Often from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda Galaxy with naked eye can be seen clearly.</seg>

<seg id="862">"with the first round of the season, Andre Hoffmann was happy, with the result also if there weren't the two opponents at 2: 2 against Braunschweig."</seg>
<seg id="863">"these were two opponents too much, and we have to watch out better in Aue," says the defense player from Fortuna Düsseldorf. "</seg>
<seg id="864">"in the Ore Mountains, the chain of the three-chain should be further optimized."</seg>
<seg id="865">And one goal after a freeblow is not to catch the Fortunas any more.</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future, it will be that no more besides Michael (Rensing) will focus on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be able to cope better with the three-chain teams even after the experience in preparation with the three-chain.</seg>
<seg id="868">"I don't know how to act in aue," "says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause," "because we have just in the three-chain at the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann, who can build good," "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we harmonize even better and we don't make so many mistakes in the setup."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann is going to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"however, whether one can speak after a draw from a failed start, does not know."</seg>

<seg id="874">His trainer wanted to know nothing about that.</seg>
<seg id="875">"I do not judge the start of the season only after six to eight days of play," Friedhelm Funkel said, who would not want to talk about an advantage compared to Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be stopped early due to a storm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know about 100% where they are at the moment," says the inner defenders of Fortuna. "</seg>
<seg id="878">The guests from the Rhineland leave the Rhineland as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue.</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep them away, just because we are entitled to come under the first six, is bullshit," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>
<seg id="880">"there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which you have to beat from the start," explains Fortunas's executive coach. "</seg>

<seg id="883">New results of Swedish asylum-age application tests published</seg>
<seg id="884">Recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden submitted to a new method for medical evaluation of their age show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results.</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) commenced the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum procedure, they should take a closer look at the appraisal of the age after the Swedish Migration Service (Migrationsverket) was criticized for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor."</seg>
<seg id="887">"to date, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 cases to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were judged as 18 or older but in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "perhaps 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">In 432 cases the conclusion was that the person may be under 18 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson from Forensic Medicine Agency, the results over the past months are steady."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we see no big difference in statistics of the past months, the figures are fairly constant," he said of The Local. "</seg>
<seg id="893">The high percentage of cases in which the person was judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers have lied about their age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there are 442 cases that" suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older. "</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the paper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results, she found out that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year."</seg>
<seg id="896">"the method of medical age assessment, in which x-rays of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, has also been criticised in some areas."</seg>
<seg id="897">"a sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus the Karolinska Institute, whose work encompasses the appraisal of the biological ripeness of humans to see if they usually went through puberty sooner or later."</seg>
<seg id="898">I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">Assessing biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">"if we cannot say it safely, we should not do as if we could," "he said to the newspaper Metro."</seg>
<seg id="901">"Göransson of Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests:" in general, you can say that the risk of finding a child as an adult is low. "</seg>
<seg id="902">"the biggest risk is, if the person is under 18, in this case, this is about 10 percent."</seg>

<seg id="933">"the parties represented in the chalk day (CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, FWG, left) belong to a broad alliance, which is peaceful in this day, because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle is inviting Rondell to the loud" "great campaign". ""</seg>

<seg id="998">"the entire Council and the Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognised that it has experienced some fairly hot times, and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned."</seg>
<seg id="999">CoE said he was also "delighted" that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction.</seg>
<seg id="1000">"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the Task Force recommendations that this is not the moment to re-use Russia," Coe said. "</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the guiding organization that supervises the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair-Play rules, launched in 2011 by UEFA, mean that PSG has to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (€262 million) to purchase the Brazilian from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary which will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can easily make the money loose for Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars in view of the financing of the team by the energy rich royal family of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money for the acquisition of players, but have to counterbalance with legitimate revenue sources, which allow them to break even point in their game related to football."</seg>
<seg id="1129">"FFP was conceived by Michel Platini, following his election to the UEFA President in 2007."</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, who had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively cheat and risked to ruin themselves when banks or owners withdraw their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration on the debt of the clubs to the monitoring of its losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, which was originally used in Chelsea in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - to be a harder issue."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current annual FFP publishing period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses of €30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini fell into disfavour in 2015 by the presidency, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, continues to scare off excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the selling price for the next five years amounting to 44.4 million euros can be reported in the financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (then 82 million dollars), which was lowered to 20 million euros later - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"UEFA is looking for clubs, which could try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their income through companies associated with the owners of a club."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a katarisches undertaking could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship exceeds the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">"this was exactly what happened in 2014, when the UEFA decided that the PSA sponsorship was boosted by the Qatar Tourism Authority."</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments could come to Neymar by payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar WM will become ambassadors and that such manoeuvres for the UEFA regulatory authorities could be easy to find out.</seg>

<seg id="1147">They talked about the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press since they were not competent to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of 542.4 million euros.</seg>
<seg id="1149">Accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published.</seg>
<seg id="1150">"PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals, merchandising and jersey sales."</seg>
<seg id="1151">The association expects sales to rise by at least 30 percent after signing in.</seg>
<seg id="1152">"the Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players to see, and she tried to prevent Neymars move by claiming that PSG would hurt the FFP."</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of the league, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar's last ownership to PSG. "</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new shooter supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">"over the past few years, Chocolat Frey Bord-Chocolate has produced chocolate for Swiss."</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet cooperation is at a possible end: the airline is writing the contract anew.</seg>
<seg id="1161">"at the request of the news agency, Swiss-spokesperson Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a corresponding report from the newspaper" Northwest Switzerland "on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="1162">"according to current planning, the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products were checked every two to three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>
<seg id="1164">"we are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey," said the spokesperson. "</seg>
<seg id="1165">"each year, approximately 17 million small red-white packed shocks of 14 grams distribute the flight attendants before landing to the passengers."</seg>
<seg id="1166">Swiss didn't want to provide any information about the cost.</seg>
<seg id="1167">Industry insiders estimate the order volume in "Northwest Switzerland" to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary generates annual sales of about one billion Swiss francs.</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a shooter manufacturer.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Swiss does not want to reveal how many applicants find it in the new tender.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"however, there are only Swiss manufacturers in question."</seg>
<seg id="1171">"according to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey will try to renew the contract over the spring 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1172">"for the sda, the largest chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement."</seg>
<seg id="1173">"since 2006, Swiss has distributed chocolate panels on board their flights."</seg>
<seg id="1174">"before the Swiss concluded a contract with Migros subsidiary, Barry Callebaut shipped the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug."</seg>
<seg id="1175">Swiss moved to Chocolat Frey two and a half years ago with the opportunity to place the logo.</seg>
<seg id="1176">The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers.</seg>
<seg id="1177">"the First Class customers will be spoilt for long haul flights from the Sprüngli Confiserie, in Business Class nifty passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in Economy Class Schoggi by Chocolat Frey."</seg>

<seg id="1184">"this repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90-year Grunge era (as the pioneers David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch-comedy" The State "for MTV), and for themselves - that is, for 2001 before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to bigger things."</seg>
<seg id="1185">As a cultural artifact it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era permanent memories.</seg>
<seg id="1186">"but as franchise, it feels like time is scarce."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not just because of his absurd humour (it contained an original story for a promising pose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin). "</seg>

<seg id="1196">"it is especially fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons' moustache 'Singles', whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker."</seg>
<seg id="1197">"it is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise as a kind of repetitive" Seven Up!

""</seg>
<seg id="1198">"Comrade Detective" on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of "The Americans," to the film "Atomic Blonde" and even "GLOW" with its east-eastward-west wrestling iconography. "</seg>

<seg id="1206">"with six long episodes, it pulls away, and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough."</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective, who was edited on a lower length, could better deliver his agitprop satire because Gregor and Iosef continue to visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers."</seg>

<seg id="1211">The police have succeeded in hitting the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">"on Wednesday morning, in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Konstanz, Esslingen and Stuttgart, numerous objects were searched, as the public prosecutor's office was rushed on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="1213">15 respondents were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">"in addition, officials also secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms and several hundred thousand euros."</seg>
<seg id="1215">"in the case of simultaneous raids in Italy, two people were arrested."</seg>

<seg id="1230">"in the case of asylum procedures and deportations, shortcomings in the data recorded there may lead to some serious misdecisions, in a manner in which the" Süddeutsche Zeitung "exists."</seg>
<seg id="1231">"according to data, ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the register, including approximately 5.7 million from non-EU countries."</seg>
<seg id="1232">"according to this, the data is administered by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="1233">"because the data has not been adequately maintained, the data quality in parts has not been good so far."</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">"the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged, after the weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it retained the interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the political decision-makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates down to 0.25%, with fewer members going to increase in this month as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7% and by 2018 at 1.6% and warned that the pressure on budgetary income would continue, with inflation expected to rise to just under 3% in autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1267">But she signalized that interest increases would be necessary in the coming years to restrain the inflation heated by the Brexit and she said that borrowing costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets.</seg>
<seg id="1268">Members also agreed to withdraw a portion of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will call for time for financing plan to provide cheaper funds for banks as of February, although it was said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central prognosis of the MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak at short notice, as the pressure on the real income of households continues to strain consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"in the interest rates, it repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be required to cool inflation and a" slightly larger scale "than the markets expected."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank pointed out that increases were" gradual "and" limited. ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Bank's growth forecasts revised upwards for this and next year are 1.9% and 1.7% compared to the expected in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell to these news against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound fell by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations on interest income, and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% in the preceding three months increased to 0.3%."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to lie at 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report provides little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and slight salary increases, as the tightening of inflation becomes worse before it gets better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot" prevent income "," but she added that wages at the end of their three-year forecasts are "clearly" to recover. "</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also boosted by the rising demand for British goods, which is due to the weak Pound, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes a year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the fall of the spark."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's last ruling on interest rates, the call for interest rate increased as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policy makers demanding an increase of 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation decreased from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said it was expected and will tighten it in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The bank said that the overwrite in relation to its target of 2% was "wholly" attributable to the weak Pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Mr Montbrate, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" in view of the recent decline in Swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to be more competitive again, as the creditors would rather search for businesses and want to finish the year in a positive manner. "</seg>
<seg id="1289">"the market is particularly good for those in which the existing deals expire and the new mortgages conclude, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"NHS (National Health Service) to prescribe 10,000 people controversial HIV drug"</seg>
<seg id="1291">"patients will receive access to a" "transformative" "HIV prevention treatment from September after a fight against the High Court against financing the drug in NHS."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England admitted that a preventive maintenance prophylactic (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, after which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the allegation that the local authorities were supposed to finance him."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the chess move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as an" "important new intervention" "while the National Aids Trust (NAT) designated this as the" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow the registration of people, and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 in all England."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Prediction prophylaxis (prep) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection risk.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before intercourse means that just enough medication is present in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medicines may be taken every day or so two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"appropriate candidates are identified in clinics that agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual health clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will sign £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to deliver the medicines this week following an international competitive purchase.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the full potential of prep by collecting clinical evidence, as it is targeted, taken up and implemented on a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">"Stevens said:" "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of sustained progress in coping with one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National Aids Trust), said:" "this is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, when targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded study in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, Chief Executive Officer of Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" "the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind."</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now, as the prep test medicine is procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, shadow minister, said:" "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation through the government."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us one step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will contribute to the eradication of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living Big Life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court flat into a generous home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, shrank in 2014 from a big house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room," "says Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1321">I was looking for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot apartment was completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-bedroom property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to optimally use the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge was to create a mezzanine in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">He had to think creatively in order to resolve the issue.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend.</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but putting the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirror feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units offer space for all the cutlery and glasses of yoke."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous room, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Folding kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering art went in," explains Erfan from the steel reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is counterproductive so that when you push the door, it slips very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne was able to gain an additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property will be appreciated," Erfan says. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the floor size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to increase the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things you touch and can therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," Erfan says. "</seg>

<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute due to one of the largest real estate imperialist Victorias worth over $500 million."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul."</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a store at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family founded jeans and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul described as" "principal operator and the dominant personality" "in the De Lutis family - about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court file states that this means that Colin owned property amounting to $316 million and Paul worth $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The distribution of properties and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the appraisals proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business, of which Colin, as Paul claims, have ruled out."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but throws Paul to manage some property incompetently."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"costs rise in the case with hundreds of pages with affiridavits, e-mails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">Mrs. De Lutis and her deceased husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen stores from the late 1950's and in the early seventies bought a shop in Brunswick.</seg>
<seg id="1374">"they used the security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first JeansShop of the family."</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco when he was the High School in my last years when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on her property to her sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," she wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis Group, where Colin claims that Mark had paid $10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"Luke, as well as Mark, have become bitter about the conditions of their financial division."</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin withheld himself very much even though he was a former AFL member and after a biography from 2015 Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin responded by SMS to say 'I really can't say much' because the case is in front of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our surname through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother's demands.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end up in our current dispute," he said, adding that he "still hoping for a solution." "</seg>
<seg id="1386">On Friday this hope seemed to be over.</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our affair will be solved by the courts in the near future," Colin wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1388">Trumpet's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Maybe John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including the news media reports - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he represented a major problem in President Donald Trumpur's White House, which he wanted to fix: bad information that comes into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly told employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"Kellys diagnosis makes sense, but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump Relationship to television reaches decades ago - and now, where he is in the White House, his television advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were to convince," said the former campaign consultant Sam Nunberg in February against Politico. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"at the time, Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote that" the key to control Trump's Twitter habit, according to six former campaign officials, is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant praise. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trumpet's Twitter custom was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know yet - that Trump Tweets would have included even more fuel without their interventions.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his co-workers managed to keep anger from him a number of times, then their efforts paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump's controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of the advisers, to give the president for strategic reasons dubious information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump, like a volcano can react to negative press cuts, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he tries to find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone maliciously delivered a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh to" "be the source behind a heap of leaks" "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"even though Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence, or that he has uttered false accusations in the past and has revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump reading the article and began asking staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork that Trump receives. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly is trying to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove to be more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his consultants are still striving for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys Mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1444">From Birkenhof is Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is taken from the former hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closing of the hotel Birkenhof by the former ambience of operating company ltd. on April 13th, 2014 approximately 30,000 overnight stays were lost per year and also income from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic rising numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered to the Regional Office as a collective shelter, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers from the establishment of a land plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">"at that time, the decision was not undisputed in the municipal council."</seg>
<seg id="1452">But above all Freudenstadt's Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and already spoke of serious people interested in the house at that time.</seg>
<seg id="1453">He was supposed to keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer with registered office in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"they are called Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"the former Hotel Birkenhof has been building shuttles in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house, it becomes clear how extensive renovations are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors have been torn out, ceilings are partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single construction site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do by March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"later on, everything should become" "pretty civil" "as Thomas Scherer is expressing."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery."</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and conference room belong to the facilities."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"one does not want to be positioned at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an elevated inner city level, Scherer emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise, with its about 60 rooms, wants to spread broadly, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual travelers, groups or business people should feel comfortable at the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause, says Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The performances of the city are identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">Thomas Scherer doesn't want to pinpoint exactly the amount of investment required.</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under a million euros, he calculates."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the exterior installations are also brought forward, which is already clearly visible."</seg>

<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: us Special Investigator sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair surrounding US President Donald Trump, Special promoter Robert Mueller should have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the panel has taken up work over the past few weeks, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN broadcaster reports that there are already first shipments of the committee in connection with a meeting between the Trump of the oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time interfering in the 2016 presidential campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller examined whether there were agreements between the Trump Contest team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">The investigations focus on several men who were active in the election campaign as adviser to the republicans.</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller also examined more and more trumps private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"the" "Washington Post" "wrote several weeks ago that the Sondereremitter Trump personally indwells the centre and investigate whether the president may have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence in possible crime incidents and to decide whether to charge a charge.</seg>
<seg id="1490">"therefore, Grand Jurys are also called the defendants."</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when it comes to larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The process is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The body can also be turned on by the public prosecutor in order to invite persons to be interrogated under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to CNN, invitations were issued which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were summoned to testify that it was stated in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">They should also provide documents.</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trumpet's advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner and his former election campaign chief Paul Manafort were there."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the introduction showed that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work, and that if necessary he would act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the release of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"Russia's history is a total invention," Trump said. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the topic gives the Democrats an opportunity to" feel good, "because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special adviser Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"however, this work usually works in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">"the White House endorses any measures that hasten the work of the special agent in a" "fair" "way."</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI chief James Comey told three times that he was not going to be determined against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"I have no reason to assume that something has changed, it was stated in the statement."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this withdrawal, accusations against Trump were loud, he did not want to hinder the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"in June, Comey testified before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculations about whether Trump Mueller was going to dismiss.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent promoter of the Congress, such as in the Watergate affair surrounding the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the urge of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented legislation on Thursday, after which the Special Agent could no longer be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the Western Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg has been solved by the seven-fold size of Berlin from the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was confirmed by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the colossal piston, weighing over a trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres, is now driving north and will probably take two or three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger for human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1524">The extent to which climate change played a role in the demolition of the iceberg is unclear according to research data.</seg>
<seg id="1525">"all in all, however, there have been a series of unusual breakdowns in the region for about 30 years, writes the US research centre for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has been a part of Larsen-C-Schelcows so far.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelcows floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It continues to grow into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelcows lies south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this horseshoe, the balance of waxing and abort was disturbed a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"an entire ice shelf is broken down there, writes AWI research scientist Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is some evidence that the Larsen-C-pillar is in danger, as the front edge has never receded as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice sheet stands under tension and can disintegrate if a piece breaks off at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">"the melting of Schelcows and Eisberg does not increase sea level, as they float on the water and squeeze as much water as it results after the melting itself."</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the sea level, but only to a small extent, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI, the Larsen-C-Schelcows is the fourth biggest ice shelf in Antarctica with almost 50,000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean around 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks off regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change, the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of the British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," he also confirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"according to his colleague, Adrian Luckman, his colleague, Adrian Luckman, said:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even though these researchers do not lead to climate change, the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen into ruins in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic extends towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The rise in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"over the past 50 years, the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees and is thus one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest."</seg>

<seg id="1555">The teachers in the circle are obviously very much sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"however, the group still lacks personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"at present, there are still 50 vacancies at the Mettmann county."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the parties' desire, the administration should develop a concept for recruiting personnel and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is to meet not only short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented candidate shortage."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orient itself inwards and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entry and include a training offensive, call for CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">That sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you did not know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities attract good officials and employees and offer more attractive terms.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"the speech is of a real" "competition of public employers." ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, there is a high number of employees who are leaving the ministry for disease or age reasons."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"thus, the highest time for action so that no more places remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Völker, group leader of the CDU, will go beyond the joint motion with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he was already in the working day for a big surprise, when he publicly questioned the number of personnel and the other parties startled."</seg>
<seg id="1572">People want all possibilities to be verified that enable a withdrawal from the municipal employers' association.</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we don't come to a satisfactory solution in the short term, the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the surrounding cities - should strive for a house-tariff," "says peoples."</seg>
<seg id="1574">This means that the CDU tries to pay better to the clerks and officials than it actually sees the tariff for the public service.</seg>
<seg id="1575">"salaries are currently exactly prescribed, raises or more money is only when one changes to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>

<seg id="1580">Italy has warned NGOs that deploy inflatable boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue this unless they stick to new rules for their operations.</seg>
<seg id="1581">"when NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue working," "said interior minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa."</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German aid organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their crew had worked together effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has only been in operation for a year, refused to comment on the extensive allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the salvation of human life is our top priority. so we are very sorry we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," "said the organization in a statement on the social media."</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only judge any accusations that are currently being collected, after collecting all the information and assessing the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had rescued the boat from 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is assumed that its crew takes dinghy migrants on board, which are supplied directly by human traffickers, and that smugglers can go off so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least such an encounter occurred only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's file whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the crew is suspected of violating the authority of the Italian coast guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons, and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, like the Iuventa, boats like the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs who are involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to stick to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring any" "substantial changes or disabilities" "of their bailout actions."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, Nobel Prize winner organization is Doctors Without Borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"meanwhile, Minniti has said that the number of migrants arriving in Italy after the rescue measures has declined sharply in recent weeks, indicating that the efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguards and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"" "in recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the Minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who are leaving these countries in hope to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine women bikers, the" "Berlin outpost" "and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the North Palatinate for four days to enjoy trials and sightseeings."</seg>
<seg id="1599">Three friendly guides were available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Tal proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest from Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour conducted hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far above the Palatinate Forest and the aforementioned levels."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between there were repeatedely long climbs, for the long trials rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the folk festival Wurstmarkt.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again, there was a lookout spot at the lookout point, connected by" flew "Trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">"on the last two days, many altimeters were announced again."</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and huts brought welcome break."</seg>
<seg id="1609">"in Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled saline brine in the open-air tank."</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>

<seg id="1612">Console instead of grass - Bundesliga is avid for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of sweating through the stadium furs when it comes to wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact is: e-Sport has long since become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business, including big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high fees."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"these have also recognised the first federal states, which are increasingly involved in this field."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and recently the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and took two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">It is certain that several clubs arise on this train.</seg>
<seg id="1619">"next weekend, the FIFA World Cup in London organized the first" Interactive Club World Cup "in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven also qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"real football has to deal with the 14-30-year-olds in particular, that young people will go to the stadium in the future," says the 52 year old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs were trying to conquer all possible markets, especially Asian."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent E-athletes under contract, you could be more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Bundesliga to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in e-sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or even the FIFA World Cup are contested at a competitive level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, leagues have long since established, in which the pros race against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and for the Asian Games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is safe to get used to."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Also Ingo Frobbing has long been dealing with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne, e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical responses that can be found in classic sports such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"it also needs cognitive abilities, a technical and tactical insight, and a quick reaction."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">But Frobbing also sees problems: "doping becomes more and more an issue."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls were difficult to carry out on online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sports were missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">"in a positive way, the scientist emphasizes the high integrative impact of E-Sports."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the move internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural barriers."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the Management Consulting Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth ahead of E-Sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros were implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsorship and big tourneys."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, sales are expected to reach 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the almost 2.4 billion Euro of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the E-Sport is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," the Deloitte Consultants write. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already on the move.</seg>
<seg id="1647">"big markets are Asia and the US, where former basketball players Shaquille O'Neal and baseball player Alex Rodriguez participate in the NRG eSports team."</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport Wagners Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">"in Europe too, things are happening."</seg>
<seg id="1650">"in a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a subject, says Frobbing."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and France, the Bundesliga-associations, according to Dutt, are now obliged to establish an e-sport department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"Germany is lagging behind in the European comparison," explains VfB Chairman Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">"only to decay into nostalgia, and to clear the old times, is not enough today."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but at the same time to align the company on the modern market."</seg>

<seg id="1662">"a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years, because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been exposed to parole."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"Carter was convicted in June for the negligent murder of Conrad Roy, who took his life on 13 July 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing," "My family is inconsolable."</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she was faced with a maximum of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward pointing eyes when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have killed Conrad Roy," said the prosecutor to the court. "</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she has no responsibility," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carters's lawyer said it was a "awful circumstance that they deeply regret.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"however, Judge Lawrence Moniz, however, did not find out that" age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions. "</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a public prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said there was" "no day on which I am not praying the loss of my beloved son."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try, in spite of all my pains that we will carry for eternity with us, to be there for his sisters." "</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, testified that she was" "persecuted" "by the realisation that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or be aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer have the only person I have been with since my birth every day is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case appears to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to commit another, commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">The case attracted national attention after Carters revealed text messages that encouraged him to end his life.</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang up, hop on a building, refresh yourself, I don't know there are many ways," "she said in several news, which she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote:" "you must do it, Conrad" "and" "All you have to do is turn on the generator and you'll be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said Carter's attention was looking at Roy's death and ordered them to benefit by some press from the case.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>

<seg id="1703">"and at all Kimi worked in this starting formation like the one, who can take the helm at the best."</seg>
<seg id="1704">He gave instructions and tried to direct the untrained troupe.</seg>
<seg id="1705">"he had a view of the whole, while many others were occupied with himself."</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal thus, to overplay his missing fitness (hardly worked); Renato Sanches therefore, on the devil, to get out of the achievements of the Asia trip (also only conditionally); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle thus, in their first appearance in the Bayern Trikot, do not have a negative impact."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"after all, it worked quite well."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"in addition to Kimme, Rudy up in front of the defense, Süle both acted confidently."</seg>

<seg id="1726">"it was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, as Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate."</seg>
<seg id="1727">This is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a shift in economic policy - and simultaneously add the old minister.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"Frank Natus, Chairman of the Association of Trier companies (VTU), says:" "Wissing attacks the desires of the economy, which has blocked Lemke all."</seg>
<seg id="1730">The biggest turnaround sees natus in infrastructure policy: the gap between the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.</seg>
<seg id="1731">"this year, the ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021 is expected to be right."</seg>
<seg id="1732">"the West is also playing a role in the plans of the country, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan."</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the aim is to put the route into operation in December 2020, says ministerial spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>

<seg id="1739">But the homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">"the planned road construction is quick to provide facts, but at the same time the country lacks the necessary personnel, says Jan Glockauer, managing director of the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK)."</seg>

<seg id="1744">Frank natus also expects a country's concept as to how it wants to remedy the shortage of skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">"furthermore, the hitherto existing broadband expansion in the country is sobering."</seg>

<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the enterprises as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European automakers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions regulations.</seg>

<seg id="1759">"companies try to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices that could regulate emissions to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but in normal driving conditions."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and unceasing drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room: opponents, Neutral, Allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and abdominal pain are sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the government's salary list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no respite from violence, and while the bodies pile up throughout the country, more and more journalists are in the process: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto resigned in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter is its editor and its inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the 1930's, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters will discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder Attorney General was set up in 2010 to process the cases of journalists, it has only launched two criminal proceedings in accordance with the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year, journalists are rarely challenged by journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting for discussion of security has little use, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez relied on the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the state capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he only managed to drive a few blocks away before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with" "twelve river". ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a woman and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">"but on the topic of Valdez, there is practically nothing but silence."</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the past year and the extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa became one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions struggle here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it does not matter that in Sinaloa anyone or several people are shot at the street or that the graveyard is full of ornamented, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Forget for a minute that there is a state of "peace" when only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trading routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke with his guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes two misconceptions have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"firstly, in February the publication of an interview with Damasco Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, presumed gang members bought every copy of the issue as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was not to compel Valdez to leave the country for its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story."</seg>
<seg id="1843">"Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad, and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1844">He survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003, when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollar holdings."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the drug problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"over time, the newspaper earned a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">Journalists loved to be able to publish intricate investigations without fear of censorship and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria-Moors Cabot Award "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez gained the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I want to continue living," "he said at the time of the CPJ Award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"" "drug trafficking in Sinaloa" "is a way of life," "he said in an interview with Rompeviento-TV last October."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why didn't you say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curb like a port-worker, the friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit on the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine destruction?</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced her to question their own assumptions about how to do their work best, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret starting and landing runways" to move drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust your own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells bad, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happened to Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states in which a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape changes constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"days before it became known that Spyware, exclusively sold to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen were looking for shelter from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a central-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in a joke, some of the reporters asked themselves if these officers were among the 50 per cent of the police officers who were not trustworthy of the Governor themselves."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters go to the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Riodoce has printed three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous boxing champion Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposure to state expenditures focused on the governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group, one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the office of the prosecutor, carried out a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so caution was advised when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city: that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the reigning Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption of high caliber cases."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez also viewed the Valdez column as the best informed source about kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"in the past, we knew what happened," said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname "El Flaco" because of his slim physique. "</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication are broken with our sources."</seg>
<seg id="1886">Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage room for signs and stickers that protest against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they themselves never expected: activists in the name of the press.</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snatched a few signs and went to a demonstration in the next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA testing that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"throughout the country, journalists have become phonetic, having written" SOS Press "protests and constructions in organized protests."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"during a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez, Ramirez blamed the authorities to spy on journalists and put them around because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since asked for her to be divided by the government, because she is concerned that her anger hurt her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, by participating government officials and an indifferent society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco Journalism, "he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media Wächtergruppe" Articulo 19 "assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to hold your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">Obviously the murders have a deterrent effect.</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones lay next to their separate head.</seg>

<seg id="1904">In 2010 Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the heading "What do you want from us?"</seg>

<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still monitor the streets and search for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>

<seg id="1914">The war escalated further as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region.</seg>

<seg id="1920">"under the mighty portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks."</seg>

<seg id="1925">It was so good that they could even find that his scaly skin was reddish brown - and they said they had had something from a "restless past."</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described it as" the best preserved dinosaur ever found, and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world. ""</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his unbelievably well preserved condition has astounded researchers, who describe it as" truly remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to National Geographic reports, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"Shawn Funk was found on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">He hit something that was out of place from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely.</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to discover the wild animal within the 2,500 pound (1,100 kg) heavy ground clump."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blink only a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," "said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens, the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that this herbivorous, although it is covered with armor and resembles a shifting tank, probably was threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-shading, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed it to better mix with its surroundings and escape its enemies, say experts, suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier has made headlines for the first time in May and is now to be seen at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta marknachelli, according to Mark Mitchell's museum technician, one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours with it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The astonishing preservation of the specimen enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and arms about his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising, as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it indicates that the dinosaur has been chased by eating dinosaurs of enough pressure, that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter shading - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and vulnerable than prey, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur carnivores must have been in the Cretaceous period," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on pointers on his life, including his conserved performer, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank down to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as southern flourishing today, and rivers and oceans probably much farther inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal", "Brown said."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early Cretaceous period.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just squint a little with your eyes, you might almost believe that he's asleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous period was a time when giant theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs standing on two legs crossed the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was chased by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"it belongs to the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 feet (11.5 m) long, six tons heavier monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in the mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk when he dug in the Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on March 21, 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the best kept dinosaur in the world, including skin and armor, and is completely removed from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were on average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes raged by his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivorous was swamped by Western Canada until a flooded river flooding it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater coverage of the dinosaur kept its armour in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the house bust forms still bumpy armoured plates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as' rare as a gain in the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I look at it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot lies on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at its sole.</seg>

<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card is missing or a document you have to show.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between the train attendant and passenger, resulting in a bad mood in the compartment or large room and delays in controlling their own tickets and taking the time to take care of other matters."</seg>

<seg id="2022">They stumbled over a post by someone from high school.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police had just killed an 18-year-old child, and it is still on the street," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as no one else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly being saved on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was killed, the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted a picture of Brown's lifeless body stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," "said Ferrell."</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for her and her community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She left her cell phone to return later in the evening to Tweets about people at the Canfield-Drive.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people shouting, and of a man claiming to be Brown's father who carried a sign with the inscription:" "Ferguson's police have just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed at which a policeman was standing in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman took his rifle and cried," "I will kill you... animals all."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," "Ferrell recalled her statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the type of murder we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">"at that moment, I felt chills."</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and cried. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 11pm she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the subject of a new documentary," Whose Streets?, "in the cinemas from the 11th century."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"when Ferrell came to Ferguson with her daughter, who wore a cauldron and a suitable crown, the two had a conversation that they had countless times before this morning" on the black experience and the black state. ""</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her with me," "said Ferrell later."</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am fortunate enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would be doing a bad service to keep them away from them.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first station, when they arrived in Ferguson, was on the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority that became a camp area when the activists waited for the potential non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there, Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism changed completely after August 9," she said, realizing that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association, focusing on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, during an evening demonstration, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came up Ferrell in the sense:" do you want to document, or do you try to find a story that you can use? "</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often of whites, in a community profiting from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," We heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson did not centre their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt passengers."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"Ferrell brought the project closer, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets "in the years after Browning's shot."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we're talking," Davis said. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me to show how these people are represented, for like that I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrell's experience - to show that the movement" is not a Messiah guide, but a community that comes together, "said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets? "are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell's life, as she falls in love with and marries her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," "said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I have understood that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferrell's story repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin have shaped the film" "Blacklive Matter" "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have borne the movement overall," "said Ferrell," "and so we are constantly fighting at different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the brunt of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to notice that" "the movement is really held up by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmatical type of action, "in which Ferrell was chosen because of her identity as the heart of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not by chance, although it was at the forefront because in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman stands as much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"meanwhile, the telecommunications cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial lines between the church and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"however, she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We must love and support one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss bit-gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">The bit gallery moves people even though they haven't been built for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been splitting people into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009.</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the topic hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while one can say to the bit gallery:" that would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be real great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" no man needs "(Siggi Betzen) or simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while advocates are building a gallery to attract more customers to the city, from which the rest of the shops will benefit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketing products offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"with the beginning of the construction work, it will end."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The Gallery-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Room: "we have been selling in the farmer's market almost every week for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the ladies ever very gladly."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher shop we discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would wish that even during and especially after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">In other cities there is also this.</seg>
<seg id="2103">"especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting." ""</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketers settle in a market hall in the gallery comes to the height of the rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"this should probably not be very low in the new project." ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what are the shopping palaces in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothes, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think that is superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is already enough in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap at the top."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops are only rented by larger companies in a shopping centre, as the rents there are often unsustainable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"too bad, special transactions are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping centre with a market hall doesn't fit me together.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery doesn't fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">"first of all, where should the farmer's market hall be built during the construction period?"</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run if the bit gallery actually comes.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the ghost bit gallery already manage to sell all the shops from Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "that just won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the unbelievably many - as I find - senseless construction projects in Bitburg are no longer a place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A fitting similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the premise of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces can be seen - white, black and brown that almost resemble themselves - that hang on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tufts and haircuts that were sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent out the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth jail, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after being classified as secret diplomacy on the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming Stresemblance (A fitting resemblance).</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline agreed upon her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwife and pioneering dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama, when he only had three days in his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"through algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from maning and created from the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data, a sharp, albeit slightly intellectual commentary, is created not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways it can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also of identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her picture was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black and white blond in which Manning obviously sits on a driver's seat and carries a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg originated from the great success of its 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">In it the artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette buttocks and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like.</seg>
<seg id="2135">This was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she couldn't go to that time and she couldn't be photographed, so she contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"in the course of two years, the artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal eyewitnesses who exchanged several letters over the course of two years."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" supplement image, "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, which foresaw a future in which President Chelseas Law would convert and it would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama, in fact, only a few days after the book was published, would demand Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, since Donald Trump conducts a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops in order to find new, tweetable ways to avoid the rigid divisions that he actually should fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said" "things happen for a particular reason."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery, Manning demanded with her excessive signature below (the" i "in her family name is marked with a heart) an end to" automatic fragmentation, the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, mitochondrial DNA sequences are written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show through the inclusion of 200 letters (or nucleotides according to the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as amazingly similar, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take away is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how open genetic data is for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video work of 2007, Spurious Memories, is also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is kept in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic-novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she appears with a hands-free phone in the hand from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"if they make your speech cold, then they have won." "</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, greeting from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if she should do it, she will be greeted by the masks in the middle of the room, from her own genomic simulacles, which intermingle like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also purposeful, like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Manning Stature), in which their genetic Haploids were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," Dewey-Hagborg said of the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind its liberation."</seg>

<seg id="2159">"a countrywide hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University, who will be looked for as suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago."</seg>
<seg id="2160">On Monday Wyndham Lagot (42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued arrest warrants for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau as the acts of the District Court of Cook County show.</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau died 26, after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>

<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of events, and Detective investigates the stitches as murder while the police are actively looking for the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">"since 2007, Lathem is professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Adult, the vice-president of university relations, said in an e-mail statement that Launame should now be judged and excluded from entering the Campus of Northwestern University."</seg>

<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that" "we are in contact with the police in Britain and ready to help the US investigative authorities in any way possible."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communications Officer of the Police Department of Chicago, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly calls on the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce each other," "said Guglielmi."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities help to find suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police got a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building, who had just received an enigmatic tip that said that something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>

<seg id="2176">"Guglielmi said it was unclear, whether the incident took place on July 27."</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Ladies and Warren were in the building.</seg>

<seg id="2183">"the WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect," stated mutko on Thursday. "</seg>
<seg id="2184">"the PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code, which describes the criteria for the replacement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website."</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria listed in the list, however, states that the Russian anti-doping authorities have to publicly accept the reported results obtained by the Canadian lawyer, Richard McLaren, to publicly funded doping in Russian sports."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"regarding the matter, Mutko said:" we carry out the investigation as our Anti-Doping system has made a mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutkos's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with Russian sales point rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov gave problems to the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>

<seg id="2195">"in November 2015, RUSADA was excluded from the Doping scandal of the WADA by conducting doping controls in Russia."</seg>

<seg id="2204">Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e-commerce start-up but the surveys did not work.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"answers were often vague, little helpful or worse - fraudulently."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"there was simply no consistency and objectivity," said Errett, who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed. "</seg>
<seg id="2208">She called for help from outside.</seg>
<seg id="2209">A new Human Resource start-up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee engagement, it enables companies to perform surveys, provide special groups and demographic groups, employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases, Whistleblowers allow managers to bypass the C-suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" "said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up GLINT, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement."</seg>
<seg id="2212">Errett said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with GLINT.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams, it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which managers have low consents results - so that you can reboitate why."</seg>
<seg id="2214">"companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain, so that you will not be the next Uber who has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of nuisances in which those who have spoken are punished."</seg>

<seg id="2261">Some have pulled off their jersey parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp.</seg>

<seg id="2263">Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final audits after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center the next morning at 6: 30 pm.</seg>
<seg id="2264">"this is a real treadmill for the guys over the next three days," Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora said just before Monday became Tuesday. "</seg>
<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the load of players, and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three training sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season, and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six playing times in Westwood practised practical exercises."</seg>
<seg id="2268">"over the course of August 18, 18 exercises are to be held. 20 before the start of formal game preparations for the kick-off against Texas A & M in September."</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his younger past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980's."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cosy seat in the Irl River Valley in Kent and now has become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaitic Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>

<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to hold this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England covers the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another emerging British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories', a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I just responded to the thumbprint on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="2302">"for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle (" To be honest: I have overrated my welcome grudge, ") seems all too beautiful to be true."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in trenches."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he walked through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscaping, gardening and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank a whiskey and started to write."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate story of Scotney is relatively unknown since the National Trust was granted full access until 2006, when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the clerks began to take care of the archive, which he described as" hundreds of years "in which aristocrats said" Oh, cast it onto the attic. ""</seg>

<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to sink into English history on a broader base, including 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of a turmoil that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex'," Rhodes says. "</seg>

<seg id="2313">Maybe the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit patcher who hid the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of Fethullah Gülen, the leader of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, Ankara has been negotiating in Ankara this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan had called the coup attempt as a" "gift of God" "because he gave him the opportunity to" "completely clean the armed forces." ""</seg>

<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article entitled" Uneasiness in the Military Headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"in the general staff there are concerns about increasing the" Islamisation "of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the headscarf ban on female soldiers, wrote the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"in any case, the Grand Master's affairs with the army and the security forces continue."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July Erdogan issued another 7395 civil servant, among them 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan was tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals used to be the masters of the country earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted on their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his election victory in 2002, Erdogan thronged the military's power step by step, not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is pushing ahead with the Islamisation of the armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="2361">"in the magazine" Vocal Europe, "an unnamed officer who sought asylum from persecution abroad after the attempted coup attempt, the Turkish army would be" full of extremists and salafists "in a few years."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it can't be any more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots will come."</seg>
<seg id="2390">Yes indeed.</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Emeritus Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must begin to take their ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of finger nail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will get them a lot more frequently," said Mr Sharkey at the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex puppets have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can" "adapt" "his robot according to his beliefs and choose anything from the eye colour of the robot via the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepford woman progressively look."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex puppets have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot, for example, allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties that they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there are the Roxxxy gold sex robots, developed by True Companion, with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as best as possible," enthuses the True Companion website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">In the course of the day she also has her moods - just like real people!</seg>
<seg id="2405">"it can be tired, be fixed to conversation, or it can be" in mood. ""</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects of this ascension of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics, the allusions to rape if one walks a step towards frigid (means here: resisting) Farrah, troubled one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"true Companion Roxxxy is compatible with a vibrator on his website, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can't men then have a Roxxxy?" "is it on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not only a fetish or just another sex toys."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their origin and increasing refinement point to something haze and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will, of course, not keep sex robots, and while the FRR noted their rising popularity, they still remain on the brink of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what is permeated out of the boundary zones, can be very instructive with respect to the spirit of the time we live in."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is, however, a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will emerge in a time in which the rights of women are threatened all over the world in which there is a president in the White House who has said that they have sexually assaulted women."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most disappointing aspect of the TV series' The Hand-maid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the entwined body and the outstretched eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornographic proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel humanely that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, brought to the point when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that hinders independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are pleasing slaves."</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House, everyone she knows, including the Republican relationship with which she fought for decades for politics, is suddenly and quite strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it is in a further context that this also entails considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and Trump, we refer to the spooky possibility that one day his bibs will no longer be repulsed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is, however, an even more frightening long-time scenario in which Trump Republicans normalize the right wing, which suddenly appear as a notion of reasonableness in comparison to his standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today I find myself falling from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's original version of the Crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked like) - both in fact seem to be a very mild offence."</seg>

<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate may sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">But a new study maintains the exact opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients suffering from inflammatory bowel disease.</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition affecting around 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States causes stomach cramps and bloating, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while people are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells in the intestine patrol in order to ensure that harmful microbes, which hide in food, do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues.</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance tends to go too far towards inflammation, it may result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have shown that a type of tolerance enhancing immune cell is found in mice carrying a specific bacterium in their initiates.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a link between a species of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan supplement more tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system also works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"the post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan explored a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when it found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe but which was separately accommodated, did not have this."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"it assumed that the difference with the intestinal microbiases of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found, which were present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were wound up in a sterile environment, so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells, and they were given the L. reuteri and the immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria had an effect on the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on immature immune cells, which were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"as the active component was purified from the liquid, it proved to be a byproduct of tryptophan metabolism, known as idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's food, the number of such cells increased by about 50 percent, but when the tryptophan was halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerating cells as mice and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something we want to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potential high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2674">"at the beginning of the information event, Schindler again gave a review of what happened so far."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"since 1991, there are certain areas of rehabilitation."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"back then, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg still took over two-thirds of the funding amount."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was at least 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, the previous renovations are a" achievement project "- it is important to also promote interior development, and not only to open up new areas of construction."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on April 4, the President of the Government of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the funding amount amounts to 833 333 Euro, of which 500 000 would come from the country, the rest from the community sensations."</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a renovation area arise?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"one will continue to investigate, as Schindler, where the" really old "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"however, it also plays a role as to whether there is any interest in the planned area."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the regional boundaries may also shift again."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"the bridge represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"Keller presented the contents of the federal government programme" Social Town, "where the renovations were then carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"the core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving living and working conditions and maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be performed object-related, that is per plot."</seg>
<seg id="2689">The rehabilitation area would then finally be set as a byword.</seg>
<seg id="2690">"the period of approval for the subsidies has been running since January 1, 2017 until April 30, 2026."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"until September of this year, however, it would only be possible to take stock, as part of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill out a questionnaire."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, the sentence should be made as far as possible, so that the restructions can begin in the coming year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"afterwards, Pietzschmann explained that every municipality had to carry out the said preliminary examinations."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the goal is to assess and decide the conditions of urban development, when it is rehabilitated and to what extent."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"for the respective plot of land, there will be also a renovation memo in the land register."</seg>
<seg id="2696">"once again, Pietzschmann will come to sensations again and make a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">"Gotzel pointed out, that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants."</seg>
<seg id="2698">Therefore there will be questionnaires that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and be filled up until the end of the summer holidays.</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" "building and land arch", "with which it is possible, among other things, about the structural condition and the renovation plans."</seg>
<seg id="2700">"in the gray questionnaire, the" "Household and Housing", "information about size, layout and residents of a living room can be made."</seg>
<seg id="2701">"the blue" "arc" "is to be filled only if the premises are operated in the building."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"however, Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"in addition, new construction measures are not eligible for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2704">"Schindler emphasised that the distribution of subsidies after the" "greyhound principle" "functioned first."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a Marine Helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month, costing taxpayers according to the military, left to TIME Magazine, up to $24,000."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 states."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter, made in Connecticut, was exhibited beside a Maine, a fire engine from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House Military Bureau demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit which is responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his superior, the deputy commander of aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the news showed that the helicopter met on the South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. on July 17th, and stayed until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on that evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">"note that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second crew for the return flight would be required due to the limitation of the service hours."</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original aircrew was during the event with the helicopter, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the recordings provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second crew was required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act forbids federal employees to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could harm destiny.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts, and we were informed that this was not the case," wrote the commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds like you're closed," answered the deputy commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the President gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft, known as Marine One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for travel.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But to demand their use only for a photo-operation is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"Trump carried out an investigation in February when the president's plane was in front of the backdrop of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of messages that complained about the use of the presidential gate by its predecessor."</seg>

<seg id="2738">"when Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 held 58 practice landings at the White House in the White House."</seg>

<seg id="2740">"in addition, helicopters flew 11 hours this day for" non-presidential support missions. ""</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said the taxpayers assumed the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman from Sikorsky said the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter to the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the US Department of Defence for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Unit records record the flight time of the plane as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter lies far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"" "determining the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include staff, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in annual funding."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a 2015 RAND study, DoD reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and conclusion of the contract."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things that are made in America this week," "said Spicer."</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds if not even thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire engine."</seg>

<seg id="2888">Interview: "Domspatzen report relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger"</seg>
<seg id="2889">The Regensburg Domspatzen report on the abuse cases relieves Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at Regensburg's Domspatzen provides further discussion.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "declared after publication opposite the German Press Agency, he was an apology from former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller, as well as the Canon Bishop Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church very much, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own layoffs or their false appraisal of the processes at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"on the other hand, the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised that reporting on violence in the Domspatzen plant was measured with" double standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in view of the attacks in Regensburg nobody doubts that it is a matter of" shameful and shameful acts "that would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation "is striking, such as the author Lucetta Scarlinia, Historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares the public opinion of keeping it normal," writes Scarlinia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis also said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "you love to go to the church and this is a devouring food."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth," "punches were a very normal educational means," "to cope with naughty children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it would be unfair to apply today's standards to earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports of the abuse cases, pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"the author and historian Michael Hesebemann, who authored the memory tape" My brother of the Pope "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages), is completely wrong."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take care of Georg Ratzinger," "says Hessian," "for all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report that the lawyer Ulrich Weber commissioned by the diocese Regensburg?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were subjected to" high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger, who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" in summary, it can be said that in many cases Domkapellmeister R. was used in many cases of physical and mental violence. "</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially in the case of high emotionality, the punishment for the students could be more severe."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"nevertheless, unlike many other defendants, many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. and, in many cases, may even associate positive memories with him in numerous cases."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesebemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger relieved his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesebemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence against violence in the Regensburger Domspatzen "" gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger. "</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students emphasize his" "humanity". ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choline-clerk and perfectionist, who became more palpable if a Domspatz brought no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you regard this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Eatzinger: if you do the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is at all in it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He is specifically devoted to eight pages and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The excesses of violence at the pre-school were also expropriated outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"he can at best reproach him, to know from it too late, or to have taken first hints seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the Domspatzengymnasium, on which he worked, was perceived by virtually all the respondents as - literally" "salvation", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes a very excellent testimony," "warm hearted," "" "sincere", "" "competent" "and" "understanding", "as extremely good-natured teacher, who regularly nourished the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and" always moved from grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to acute outbreaks."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"he himself had promised, deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he did not only snuggle with chairs and threw the keys on the ground, but also put ear-files into the hair or ears, deeply regretted and apologized for it."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"it must be noted, however, that such educational methods were widespread in the questionable time between the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think everyone of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced it in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what actually happens in this report, namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, this is certainly Bagatella."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders whether it is not more familiar with his or her role as brother of Benedict XVI, that many media have just rushed on him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many who never understood him are still working diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report releasers Georg Ratzinger in every way!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in the media, in connection with the report, there was a great deal about abuse in the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">"in the final report, Georg Ratzinger will also be charged with any involvement or involvement with regard to sexual abuse?"</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hemann: clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claimed to have trusted the Cathedral master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were dedicated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," "said a concerned representative for the others," "Everything was very embarrassing for me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem in educating sexual abuse, however, is that most victims are silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even trust parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators for a certain time."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students Ratzinger's role in terms of abuse?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hemann: a questionable student put it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I do not see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had had timely realizations and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I consider it... even for really absurd to assume that counted on him... boys are more intrusive or clearer or more likely to have opened than to their parents, boarding managers, trust teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"the report concludes with a clear conclusion:" "in the run-up to the students and / or their environment, they could not be confirmed in the examination."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is therefore acquitted of any co-worker."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of not being prevented or brought to display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to link its good name to these conflicting crimes, as it happens in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, much of" "Violence Excess" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former Cathedral master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "looking away". ""</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hemann: it's the big problem that everything mixes and mingles in the reporting, and has become a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, in the middle of it, Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But this is a misuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"there is a clean separation: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence and, we say, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report treats incidents from the time since 1945, i.e. also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral head of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"all the terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys from sadistic teachers were downright chimed and painted, all of them had to go to the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have reigned."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those, Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got his face when she was already at the Domspatzengymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this, as most witnesses stress, the subject" primary school "was taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradisiac" conditions.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the grammar school?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many sacrifices have estimated the general humanity of R. and, in numerous cases, even positively associate positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most it remains the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which he was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and was responsible, (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then back in 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Sparse Georg Ratzinger consistently scream his ears before the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Eemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatz gymnasium, which the report was even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">He points out to the fact that in the preschool the punishment will continue to be practised.</seg>
<seg id="2965">"even in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"this was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was passed when testing penalties were also banned in Bavaria for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they took place in a legal grey area, as each one of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to estimate where those affected might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permitted limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"however, one cannot say that he had always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, it was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said," "It is unfair to apply today's pedagogical standards to the time at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see that?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hemann: we are talking about the" pitfalls of anachronism, "that is, the danger of evaluating the past according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is already right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this is not true of sexual abuse, which was abhorrendous at all times and also not for what was shed in the pre-school of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond the usual practice."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"that's all awful, and I'm glad that it will finally be worked out."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take care of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"in the 1970s, his means of disciplining and punishment were widespread in the 1970ies."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as a physical punishment, he was also strictly adhered to."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger played with you in the talks with you for the book" "My Brother the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of test punishment also come to language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not at all hide that he led a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but this also has to be said: without this perfectionism, without claiming unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the rather nationally known Regensburg Domspatzen, the true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with cookies and sweets alone, the rebellious boy does not make a big singer and stand before every success, no matter which area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of person do you have experienced by Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Eatzinger: through work on the book and in addition, I have met Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced again and again as wonderful, humorous, basic, deep believing and heartfelt people, from whom you can't imagine that he could only do something for a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly get in touch with how many former Domspatzen, 23 years after his Emeritierung, regularly keep contact with him, visit him, read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who have not forgiven him until now, that he was once stern to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he always was a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, sure, that may be - but also a lovable respect, to which they still look and revere them."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, once again clearly: all that is presented to him are educational methods that were on the order of the day at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust to make a man, just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to become a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">The evil intent behind it is only too obvious.</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the report, which was just published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the propriety area, a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany probably no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally settle in peace."</seg>
