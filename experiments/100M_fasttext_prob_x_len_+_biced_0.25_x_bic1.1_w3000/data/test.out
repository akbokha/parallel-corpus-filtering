J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always plu@@ gged into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston needs not always be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; I always get stuck in drawers or get stuck from outside label , which with me and the reality usually have little to do . &quot;
I do not have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are more likely to me . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
&quot; most of all , the act@@ ress sp@@ ends her time at home , in front of a TV with loose de@@ bris and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; she brings the question about the desire for children : &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is to be seen as a single mother of two sons .
the film runs on August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the Sport pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues looked for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden World Py@@ ramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted home in the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to feed comfort . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; and with that , the equ@@ est@@ rian career ended up again . &quot;
on Saturday Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses .
&quot; he let his family run through the complex of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he did not even swear to photographic purposes . &quot;
&quot; long was the first time in Aachen , and thus also at the CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
the German Sports Aid was handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Age pyramid .
there is no lack of hon@@ ours for the symp@@ a@@ thetic athlete .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ ner lau@@ rel leaf , Champions @-@ Tour @-@ Player of the year ... &quot;
even the Queen of England has already rebu@@ ked him .
the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid is long .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; Lan@@ ger says , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting young talents . &quot;
&quot; and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US @-@ Master@@ s@@ winner was shot at the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the founder of Corn@@ elia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ dder Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jumping rider Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company immig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza @-@ price was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance from the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tr@@ ump@@ ets Economic Policy Com@@ par@@ ed : it &apos;s all about the money
investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - both Clinton and Tr@@ ump .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are at odds with the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; the differences in economic policy between Donald Tr@@ ump and H@@ illary Clinton are underlying a fundamental , rather philosophical difference . &quot;
on the role of the state .
&quot; Tr@@ ump wants to keep those in doubt rather small , and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely reti@@ re from regulations , and he is making himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : &quot; the state has certain tasks to fulfil , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money . &quot;
&quot; that is why taxes for the rich would increase , they say . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic of infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; to be invested in the future , Tr@@ ump and Clinton say almost word @-@ like . &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly opposed by the Repub@@ lican Party &apos;s Te@@ ach@@ y wing .
&quot; so , on Tr@@ ump there could still be party discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tr@@ ump wants to build coal @-@ fired power stations and drive up coal mining in the US .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in areas protected so far , and intends to cancel the Par@@ isian Climate Protection Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to explicitly expand the renewable energies with its investment programme and demands : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be . &quot;
but not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far apart from each other .
&quot; T@@ PP , the Trans@@ spa@@ zi@@ ed trade agreement , do not want to sign both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the US does not want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade but simply to better protect American jobs . &quot;
&quot; they are to be paid better , too , calls for Clinton . &quot;
the present minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a wage of hunger .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what Tr@@ ump wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage must rise , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tr@@ ump , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics keep him ahead , so the budget deficit would only be greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , who wants at least from the rich , wants to pay more taxes and whose critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot;
sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fle@@ eing themselves alone .
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often trau@@ mati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
there are four women sitting in a large kitchen .
&quot; each of them has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has laid her little son in his arm .
he looks curi@@ ously in the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es on the table @-@ top .
until she notices that she is observed .
she s@@ miles briefly and kis@@ ses the little one .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Executive Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a sponsor for social welfare services in Bavaria , and is concerned among other things with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are f@@ owl .
&quot; they live in the north of Munich , one of the few decentr@@ alised dwell@@ ings for single @-@ wing@@ ed women and their children in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs opened up the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich women &apos;s assistant . &quot;
it has recently been officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - even not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; B@@ ahr states . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death , or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; women out@@ weigh other reasons for the run : &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have had experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , hon@@ ours , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
&quot; on the run , this goes on . &quot;
&quot; for example , tu@@ gs for a bottle of water challenge a sexual act is not a r@@ arity , &quot; B@@ ahr states . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; whoever believes that as soon as they arrive in Germany , B@@ ahr relates . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; this results in the fact that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich north are trau@@ mati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily . &quot;
many women are accustomed to saying nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about what has been experienced , because shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; as she often doesn &apos;t know how to help , more accommodations only need for her , requires B@@ ahr . &quot;
in Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees .
&quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich , some say with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in the housing of governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia , fle@@ eing women are not accommod@@ ated separately , &quot; says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia , there are stories in some community shel@@ ters or own homes for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , where there are two central lod@@ gings exclusively for women . &quot;
also the committee &quot; Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommod@@ ated separately from men .
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important for men and women to be accommod@@ ated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is lacking or will men and women live together , there can be - perpet@@ u@@ ating - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need for protection can be read on the rush , which there is on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; B@@ ahr states . &quot;
you could easily open a second house .
resident doctors strike : demands for new work combat measures
assistant physicians have called on their union to approve new work combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) demanded more work combat measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC testified that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns of the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance specialists and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government had &quot; persist@@ ently calm &quot; problems , leading to the rejection of the Treaty . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; In consideration of this , the J@@ DC Executive Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and call for official re @-@ negotiations to all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC Executive Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council in order to approve a running programme of escal@@ ating work combat measures which commen@@ ced at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the dispute led that resident doctors strike six times this year , the first total failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the BM@@ A Regi@@ strar , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors and medical students . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , health minister Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the Treaty for Doc@@ tors in England would be introduced by force . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
&quot; the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands , announ@@ cing an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions . &quot;
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish opponent in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace , I can &apos;t deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed narrow@@ er , and he had little warmth , even for his restra@@ ined circumstances . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , spoke about his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report a whole five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper reported that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved as if nothing bad had happened . &quot;
&quot; to me , his enthusiasm seemed to be rather the opposite . &quot;
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radi@@ ating , sustainable cool@@ ness showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had not forgotten anything . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introduc@@ tory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to that time was bla@@ sted .
Putin denoun@@ ced and bl@@ amed Ankara to fall back on Russia .
the decline was even greater as it was done by a supposed friend .
building the c@@ ous@@ ins will be difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state @-@ controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything .
the accus@@ ations from senior officials were the most serious that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State .
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
&quot; but in St.@@ Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look for@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; after all , this meeting took place only because Putin had received the excuse from President Erdo@@ gan to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
Erdo@@ gan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was reli@@ eved of almost his office during a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at .
repeated terrorism attacks on Turkey have also shaken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late @-@ season ons@@ lau@@ ght on the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be restored . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ cht@@ sti put it as follows : &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
Ankara is fur@@ ious to the West because its reaction to the attempted tak@@ eover of power is considered a weak answer .
&quot; in addition , the persistent res@@ ent@@ ment on the s@@ nail &apos;s pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship with the West . &quot;
the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat .
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course that has a deep fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; as an analy@@ st once described : two countries that are viol@@ ating the West and feeling ill treated and are now al@@ lied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played a role as a peac@@ emaker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks both pres@@ idents met at the press conference , that they didn &apos;t even grasp the subject . &quot;
&quot; the president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster - when NATO member Turkey fired up the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two He@@ ads of State , at least , talk to each other again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for Scotland customers
&quot; according to the Board of Directors of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan shared the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself when it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported international sports with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ship , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now it has decided to put more national brands into focus .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alized Head@@ quarters and the IP@@ O will change to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for retail banking that will have more significance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dr@@ um@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ shire .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our investor brand as well as the brand under which our employees will be employed , as we are now going to become a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; now I say that we do not pursue global goals , but local objectives . &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers .
R@@ BS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations Sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in his sports sponsor@@ ship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop to the Bank of the brands , for how do we concentrate on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for clients ? &quot; &quot; said the head of the board . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and that these brands would have been launched .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3.@@ 000@@ th win at New@@ market on dile@@ ction
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori sparkling champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured its 3,@@ 000@@ th British win at New@@ market . &quot;
he set a milestone on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night on his local rac@@ et@@ rack .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , reaching the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Ri@@ chards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who in front of G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar won , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here as well
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday evening with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he wins the victory on dile@@ mma
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle course - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved over 4,@@ 300 wins in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine Der@@ by@@ si@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career successes &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone reached only a few in front of him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tactical intel@@ lect different from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and charis@@ ma thrilled fans for this kind of sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he would have already made 6,000 wins if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already suffered in the UK for almost 30 years that is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of grand tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; 1996 at As@@ cot , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties at first when he returned from his six @-@ month ban , but he showed an impressive character of strength to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he hasn &apos;t finished yet - D@@ ett@@ ori stated earlier that he wants to continue on competitions up to his at least 5 years of age .
Russian Putin firing squ@@ ad Sergey Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin un@@ expectedly dismissed his Chief of Staff Serge@@ Ivan@@ ov .
&quot; for many years , IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the tigh@@ test confidence of Putin . &quot;
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Repres@@ entative for environmental and transport affairs .
&quot; in an opinion of the Krem@@ lin , without giving reasons , Putin has ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ a@@ ino , who has been pro@@ xy for Ivan@@ ovo since 2012 , was appointed his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ a@@ ino , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in 1972 in Tall@@ inn &apos;s Est@@ onian capital , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow International Relations Institute ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is said ( in Russian ) that he later was the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the government . &quot;
he said to Putin about his appointment : &quot; thank you for your trust . &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ a@@ ino as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince you ?
this step has made Moscow more mysterious .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov , for a long time , was one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet secret service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin broadcast on television , both men asser@@ ted that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is this the result of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion that a man who once was praised as a potential president , once again wanted to lead Russian environmental policy , met with great skep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks on Putin , which are quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said : &quot; &quot; it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , to trust me this very complicated post - one could almost say - compla@@ ining posts for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
&quot; previously , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was the president of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted the most . &quot;
&quot; it was once believed that after Putin &apos;s second term , Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia , as a third term of Putin would have viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close ally of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son was fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination at the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios which produce the series announced their termination in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , publicly ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ miss@@ al . &quot;
on the set there were artistic differences and dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I repent , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details on how the character Gib@@ son comes out of the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published later on according to the position of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and put my entire heart blood into the last twelve years , &quot; &quot; Gib@@ son said in a communication published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I hoped to be there until the end , but that won &apos;t be possible now . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series . &quot;
the scheduled broadcast of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for 28 September .
puzzles for fish that landed in garden in Ban@@ ff
a citizen of Ban@@ ff asked for help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin Ba@@ in thinks it could be Sand@@ a@@ ale with the 75 fish that have been le@@ ver@@ ed out by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. Ba@@ in , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , on Per@@ is@@ cope published a video of the spectacle in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
crossing the Crossing : bridge connected with Fi@@ fe
&quot; the £ 1,@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 &quot;
engineers connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings with the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; cover blo@@ wers &quot; , &quot; approaching each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017 .
Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Que@@ ens@@ land cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for the fit . &quot;
&quot; overall , almost 79 % of the bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is now available in Ros@@ y@@ th for the deck , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; &quot; the first sh@@ utter is a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; in this fantastic project , the closure is a trend @-@ setting high and deep construction . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North Tower , we had to close the existing gap on the north or the side of the country . &quot;
this was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive , because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of approx . 3 % . &quot;
&quot; because the toler@@ ances , on which the team works , were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men are lucky to be alive
three men were lucky to be alive after they were thrown off fishing boats from fishing boats .
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck the alarm at 13 : 20 BS@@ T on Friday after a crew watched the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty swimming in safety while their boat was moving out of their own power .
&quot; we saw the boat rolling around and turned the worst off , &quot; &quot; said the leader of the rescue service of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already blown the boat out of reach , until we let go of water , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat while the third man at the age of 60 was exhausted and found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without life@@ jacket .
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men who have been thrown into the water have happiness un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but this dis@@ b@@ anded the boat from the person who controlled the boat . &quot;
someone has watched these men today .
badly injured - man bo@@ ils down to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and badly injured .
&quot; as the police ra@@ ced yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had gotten the key to the apartment to get his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcohol victim cut off the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he stab@@ bed her twice . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured at hand and at the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed his ex @-@ girlfriend clothes , he called his mother . &quot;
she then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move it to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her partner .
on the road they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ partner .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds affordable housing in Braunschweig ?
&quot; the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : in the future , investors should be taken much more seriously . &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 affordable housing in the next few years ?
&quot; at the next meeting of the council , the SPD is propos@@ ing a &quot; &quot; Home for Action &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; said S &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : those who want to build on urban areas must pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot;
&quot; the cheap apartments can , however , also arise in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , the big issue in the town hall is , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors looking to build on private surfaces ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such sites , but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
a new urban housing development programme that costs millions of costs and is still to be funded should provide incentives .
&quot; the problem , so Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is currently no agreement between the fac@@ tions . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few rules as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er conditions for investors .
&quot; regardless of what Brat@@ wur@@ st is concerned , there is a sharpen@@ ing of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the action plan is implemented , this will ensure additional tasks in the building management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the program is still not entirely up @-@ to @-@ date : the 12@@ 60 new apartments , which were to be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you compensate for the loss of further about 1300 low @-@ priced apartments , whose promotion will exp@@ ire in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent this , according to the spokesperson Nicole Palm , planning policy should now be purchased from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , we would have to think about bringing apartments back into the price band@@ aging . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the year , Fri@@ end dates back to the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; around 1800 apartments , one could get there back into the price binding for cheap apartments . &quot;
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations . &quot;
&quot; as the number of social housing in the West City is dramatically increased again , the aim of the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; pass @-@ through &quot; &quot; is to be removed . &quot;
there should not be a concentration of socially dis@@ advant@@ aged in just a few districts .
the Gre@@ ens are counting on the fact that there will still be movement in the discussion .
&quot; s &amp; D Group president , Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke , believes : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
I concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that a compromise can not yet be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world is changing .
&quot; teenagers and children no longer go outside to play , but rather spend their free time star@@ ing on screens , was compla@@ ined by many in the last decade . &quot;
&quot; at Pok@@ emon Go , it &apos;s about getting people from the sofa and getting more active . &quot;
&quot; the time on the screen was on TV initially , then limited to video games and recently on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created . &quot;
&quot; like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the release of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand fell slightly in the beginning of July . &quot;
market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ emon which can be tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the mobile ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game , when she was younger , joined the tram and jumped for the search from the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , tracking 3@@ 5.000 users , notified the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game , the number of followed people who exercise every day 30 minutes , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on the health that people want to take &quot; &quot; 30 minutes of time &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; active every day &quot; &quot; met deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people who look miserable . &quot;
&quot; however , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
&quot; those who regularly exercise sports , reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here . &quot;
but the wonderful thing about Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun .
&quot; three pillars of health are thus covered - movement , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are gru@@ es@@ ome game per@@ ks that have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what &apos;s it like ?
a breakthrough is happening .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit were able to track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us any reason to do sports as this game does . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be dimin@@ ished with time .
&quot; however , due to poker success , there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with activ@@ ism in the real world , helping many people on the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Sim@@ one Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ent@@ ur@@ nen
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Sim@@ one Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the bar .
breathtaking on the ground .
bril@@ li@@ antly brilliant .
and now finally Olympic Champion .
&quot; on Thursday , the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gym@@ n@@ ast stepped on to the competition title and extended the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games . &quot;
their overall result of 6@@ 2.@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly before the silver med@@ alists and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mate A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina .
&quot; the American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es tur@@ nes on the suspended beam during the single @-@ multi @-@ campaign women in gymnas@@ tics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American who wins a multi @-@ competition title and , in total , the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment came to an end .
this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps who brought their sports to new heights :
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the sports art of the last three years , 15 World Cup med@@ als - including 10 gold med@@ als - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said she &apos;s &quot; the best gym@@ n@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she expected a final exam in Brazil , a competition not so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring Texas would be considered a disappointment .
&quot; American women Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ g after they have won gold and silver in each of the women &apos;s individual campaigns at the Summer Olympics 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es won the first medal on Tuesday , while she served as ex@@ clamation mark at the retirement ceremony of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insisted on never having planned the future during their long journey , it is not really true . &quot;
part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is att@@ un@@ ed to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
this girl who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ mans during a school discharge into the gym@@ nasi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man exercised was turned into power .
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has not lost a competition competition , a series of victories that will continue as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina led easily through two turns , the picture was mur@@ mu@@ red . &quot;
floating beams and soil @-@ ur@@ ns - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title - lau@@ ded .
&quot; she recovered again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the suspended beam - and sat on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man hu@@ gged her gently as she expected her der@@ v@@ ying - a mere form@@ ality - and tears stre@@ amed on Bil@@ es bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book @-@ book became reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago , when she fought for the third place , but the bronze medal in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team captain , who is called &quot; &quot; O@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her practice , she cast down kis@@ ses to the audience , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed doubt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for balance , the rapidly expanding we@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : three victims in serial killer shot during listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports released on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl have been shot dead in one of the dead@@ liest attacks in the first series mur@@ der@@ ous murder of Phoenix , while chat@@ ting in the car and listening to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Roch@@ elle Liner , Stefanie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand@@ fire@@ arm while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently escaped with another vehicle to read in the report .
&quot; the police said that the triple murder didn &apos;t seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , because the aggres@@ sor did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , which were owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
&quot; the police spokesperson , Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard , said that the shooting was temp@@ ting investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks . &quot;
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in nine attacks in His@@ panic dwell@@ ings within four months and two more were injured . &quot;
&quot; it is happening in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard the K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Ca@@ dil@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to expose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on the spot . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
the authorities also published a police report on the shooting aimed at an empty truck truck half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and from which it is assumed that it was the work of the serial killer .
investig@@ ators found cartridge shells and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with a micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; it becomes better &quot;
&quot; like most of the 6 @-@ year @-@ olds , Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and , of course , his mother . &quot;
&quot; but like the very few of its anci@@ ents , Ed@@ mund Mikro@@ recep@@ hal@@ ie , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to did not know anything during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he came home the first time , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that . &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
I did not let myself into that .
&quot; what &apos;s not right at all -- of course you &apos;ve embark@@ ed on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
your husband Vincent and her have been told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alize him .
&quot; my first response to this was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people are still doing &apos; , &quot; &quot; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to explained . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit or craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is slowly making progress .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund intended for &quot; Please sing me something . &quot;
&quot; we bring him sign language , &quot; commented Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- she says . Ed@@ mund has invented some signs alone .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as well as Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the a@@ virus during pregnancy . &quot;
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zi@@ be@@ virus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
I constantly asked what will happen ?
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the forecast for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect that someone can really tell me . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the ci@@ ca@@ virus .
it will be better .
you know it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy ra@@ inf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to rescue in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy ra@@ ins and large floo@@ dings in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call the emergency state on Friday . it is expected all Saturday for more rain@@ falls .
&quot; numerous rivers in the southeast of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River flooded its banks and threatened with large floo@@ ding after extreme ra@@ inf@@ all , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with local authorities and are already on the road to help the communities affected .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Prepar@@ edness , Prepar@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ ua needed tens of thousands of sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used across large parts of southern Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; a flood warning system was deployed in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama on Friday , while it was still ra@@ ining in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the River Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the River Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will most likely reach record levels over the weekend . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers can flood many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a flood @-@ oriented floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a threat , as these rivers only flow slowly over the tro@@ dden rivers into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the River Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , already reached the highest level at 09.@@ 00 on Friday , which was ever recorded . &quot;
rescue teams still but@@ ton@@ ed people out of flood waters in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were rescu@@ ed near Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet away from the house , will rise sharply overnight . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water streaming in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife said Hans@@ ford , that she had never seen such a high @-@ rise of the river in the 48 years she lived there . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said that he and his family members had all the disabilities and he would be the only one who can swim .
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had rescu@@ ed all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they stayed until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the floo@@ ding had &quot; spread quickly , &quot; as there were still heavy ra@@ ins and that the authorities were considering evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer in the vicinity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone announced from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil had been completely absorbed by the ra@@ inf@@ all since Wednesday .
the authorities indicated that heavy ra@@ inf@@ all and floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and educational ou@@ tage in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
the C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that a co @-@ ordin@@ ator in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 houses .
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated to two churches which were now both flooded .
&quot; the leader of the commun@@ e of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets , washed up by floods . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water starts to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Ham@@ mond of the commun@@ e of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozen streets were closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents who hope to keep the water out of their houses and stores . &quot;
&quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; said L@@ acy Land@@ rum of the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the emergency manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of Har@@ rison Coun@@ t@@ ys said that it was ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of houses on Thursday should have been reported as flooded , but on Friday no reports have been reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places where I have never seen it before , &quot; &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it is still coming . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 &quot; &quot; pier@@ ced by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police tells us that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time that a 6 year old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents said that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the loin , leg , arm and abdom@@ en , but that he was aware of his transport to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he went through a lot , his small body was ri@@ dd@@ led by bul@@ lets , &quot; said his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ de@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I simply can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car , together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who finds himself in a critical condition , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just identified if one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators told C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seemed to be a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ oters .
assault ri@@ fl@@ es for assault ri@@ fl@@ es which have been traced back to various assault ri@@ fl@@ es over@@ se@@ wed the scene .
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the street , on both sides of the side@@ walk , there were leg@@ umes . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters that were very active , &quot; &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia . &quot;
several houses and vehicles were also found in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest , and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a tas@@ k@@ man at the arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she re@@ covers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the Women &apos;s Olympics in the Tur@@ ns and that is for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three tur@@ ner , Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who had inspired many young girls of other skin colors . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew@@ ess is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , which is ca@@ tho@@ lic , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team is finally ech@@ o@@ ing the US .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among the female gym@@ n@@ ast was an Af@@ ro @-@ American . &quot;
last year were Sim@@ one and Gab@@ by # 1 and # 2 .
that shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a start@@ ling Olympic winner and America rejo@@ iced . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world championships in Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ful gy@@ ms rout@@ inely . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Sim@@ one became the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we are experiencing the peak of this sport , but so do classes in the whole country do not look like . &quot;
&quot; Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie fought all the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic team will only have four gym@@ na@@ sts in the team . besides , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; however , the reality is that gymnas@@ tics are an expensive sport and tur@@ ner primarily in private gym@@ nasi@@ ums that can be maintained by parents who pay for training , training , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gym@@ na@@ sts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these clubs are located in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gym@@ na@@ sts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment for families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , trained both of her athletes since they started gymnas@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the municipalities au@@ n countless young girls inspired by Sim@@ one , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy @-@ to @-@ access sports training . &quot;
I founded my gymnas@@ tics foundation for 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we offered free and affordable gym@@ n@@ astic in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters ( especially black and h@@ is@@ panic ) and trains national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my home town ) to offer the youth high @-@ quality gymnas@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn from this great Olympic sport and to benefit . &quot;
&quot; gymnas@@ tics develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers lifetime benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , who bring thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnas@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thank you Sim@@ one , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this real representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the olymp@@ ic team gold and thank you for helping so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way of becoming healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
&quot; assistant doctors would like to organize more strikes , after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal &quot;
&quot; the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the amendments by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 resident doctors who voted in favour rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t &apos;s plans had revealed plans to introduce the treaty and said that the N@@ HS could be found in a &quot; &quot; no man &apos;s land &quot; &quot; and any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first resident doctors are to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend supplements in order to improve the maintenance of irregular hours . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , chair of the BM@@ A Committee for Assistance doctors last night in a communication with : &quot; &quot; resident doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed treaty , in particular that it will fuel the current availability crisis and to treat all physicians to do justice . &quot;
&quot; with just eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors falls under the new contract , progress must be made and time runs out . &quot;
&quot; the BM@@ A &apos;s efforts to resolve disputes through talks pushed the government to participate , and sometimes de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot;
&quot; this was done by a promise , which Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had done in the last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t has to act now , raise the vibration and address the concerns of the resident specialists . &quot;
&quot; if he does not do so , the resident doctors made it clear that they are prepared to carry out further work combat measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a delay of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments since nur@@ ses and specialists were involved in providing coverage to doctors in the strip chain . &quot;
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better week@@ end@@ salary for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , urged the resident doctors to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work combat measures do not reach anything but a little , but are already loaded with over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , car@@ ers and their families only cares , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; during the last two months , we spoke to the committee of the Regi@@ strar and responded positively to the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries on the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive engagement to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training , additional training for those who come back from a professional time , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender @-@ specific pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how seriously it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health concerning compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;

thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day medication after being advised by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ul@@ ant drug T@@ ic@@ ag@@ m@@ ack@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .

N@@ HS regulation authority has recommended a four @-@ year long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack each year and a quarter of them suffer another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
heart attacks and strokes are caused by accumulation of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls .
&quot; when the covering breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot that clo@@ gs blood flow to the heart and thereby causes a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood c@@ lot triggers , it can flow through the blood@@ stream and clo@@ g the flow of blood to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
persons who have already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
&quot; T@@ ic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ ICE pipeline , which was published today , recommends a 12 month intake of 90@@ mg T@@ ic@@ ag@@ m@@ ack@@ er@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of the N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all persons suffering from a heart attack have another heart attack or a stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a new heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
&quot; experience shows that in combination with aspir@@ in , T@@ ic@@ ag@@ m@@ ack@@ or is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who already had a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; by a preliminary recommendation from T@@ ic@@ ag@@ m@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of T@@ ic@@ ag@@ m@@ ack@@ er@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years . the pipeline design recommends no treatment that goes beyond this period .
political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Culture Aff@@ ects election fraud in Muslim areas
former Mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ on Rah@@ man was removed last year for the release of a government report for corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to widespread ignored electoral fraud in Muslim communities as a devastating government report today .
&quot; former Cab@@ inet member Sir Eric Pick@@ les interfer@@ es with the police , election observers and Rath@@ au@@ ts for ignor@@ ing evidence of electoral abuse due to &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity concerning eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former minister of integration and local government , who is now an antagon@@ ist king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barrier tapes outside electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
he recommends that voters should take an identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections .
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er must only name his name and address . &quot;
&quot; the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger , if they release their votes in order to prevent someone from choosing twice . &quot;
&quot; whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to church documents and decisions from non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this is not only for election fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by D@@ ow@@ ning Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s electoral sc@@ and@@ als in the east of London .
&quot; last year , a special selection tribunal decided that the inc@@ umbent mayor of Lut@@ on Rah@@ man should be reli@@ eved after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his office . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man would have &quot; &quot; per@@ ver@@ ted &quot; &quot; the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; in a cy@@ ni@@ cal manner &quot; &quot; and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
Rah@@ man is said to have led &quot; his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose .
&quot; up to 300 voices were either doubt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation , in which one person was chosen as someone else . &quot;
Sir Eric said there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm on the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , m@@ apped , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leading of evidence to prove identity &quot;
&quot; in his report , it says : &quot; as proof has been indicated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the El@@ ders , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions had know@@ ingly ignored such behaviour as a result of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity in regard to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the prohibition of political activists to process let@@ ter@@ box documents in order to stop &quot; picking . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is being contem@@ plated by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks in order to prevent the poll@@ ing and social labelling system being used . &quot;
consider options to ask vot@@ er prior to choosing your ID .
use non @-@ removable ink on a person &apos;s finger once it has left its voice to prevent someone from choosing twice .
to carry out systematic reviews on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are eligible .
a three @-@ year limitation on applications for an automatic choice of letters .
ban that political activists are editing full let@@ ter@@ ings and envel@@ opes of sel@@ ections .
the police have the authority to set up barriers to set up electoral stations .
a change in the law that facilitates an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the 1983 Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 .
prohibition of photography in electoral stations .
requirement that only English may be used in the elec@@ tive stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go alone in the election cabin .
&quot; Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; &quot; amazing &quot; &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets case there was no criminal complaint . &quot;
&quot; the electoral commission has declared Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
he was found guilty on a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; check@@ points &quot; of the election registration departments of the Town Hall .
&quot; Sir Eric said : &quot; &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal . &quot;
&quot; our country bears a proud legacy as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy about K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gänger and other famous Doppel@@ gänger of Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; this week , fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be amazed at the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who has proved to be an impressive Doppel@@ gänger of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympic Games is by far not the only athlete competing in gold that has its own famous Doppel@@ gänger - at least not if one is allowed to believe the social media .
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker on our screens at present , F@@ email has created a list of Olympi@@ ans that show more than just a certain resem@@ b@@ lance to Hollywood &apos;s celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , has been compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; apart from Kate &apos;s doppel@@ gan@@ ger on the race track , many people on the Internet showed how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
the team member of the US team in the ar@@ cher@@ y Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison caused a storm on Twitter after pictures on which he looks secretly like the Wolf of Wall Street Star .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got ins@@ ane in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no great simil@@ arity , with the exception of facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I guess it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly take center stage this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gym@@ n@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big expressive eyes will be able to go through Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an &apos;s Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
&quot; and in the pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with the G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
a gear higher : this user believes Nathan is the &quot; athletic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption Ac@@ tor
&quot; another prolonged comparison has been drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who shows similarly heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal @-@ s@@ wimm@@ ers Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun @-@ t@@ anned skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athletic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the simil@@ arities
theory put into space : according to this user there might be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the Internet thinks that Hope solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold med@@ alists in the Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , which has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
c@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ olog@@ ises for his statement that Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; like a pig died

&quot; Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; called M@@ ief &quot; &quot; and died during the race like &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was switched off , when at the end of the 4x@@ 200m fre@@ estyle swi@@ ffle he had his own opinions . &quot;
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been brought aboard the C@@ BS comment@@ ator team to give more &quot; colour , &quot; could be heard : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year old Chinese girl has lost the affili@@ ation , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , she went as low as a pig , died like a pig . &quot;
thank you for this .
&quot; Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers Ai yu@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming @-@ scale 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada responded quickly after they were shocked by the sound and language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ lane twe@@ ete , &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old swi@@ mmer from China &quot; like a pig died &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot did not get that they were still on air .
Ai yu@@ an from China has been described as follows : &quot; this small 14 @-@ year old Chinese girl has lost the affili@@ ation .
the cri@@ tique of By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald on Twitter was quick and hard to talk to him
Twitter users were not back when they heard how un@@ sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ don@@ ald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let &apos;s all look like ra@@ cists . # be@@ ek@@ ed .
&quot; shortly afterwards , Scott Russ@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the comment by Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we are sorry that the comment has been broadcast over a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , we are sorry that it happened . &quot;
&quot; in the end , C@@ BC exc@@ used more than 90 times in the people who responded to the Not@@ ice about Twitter &quot;
the comment@@ ator colleague Scott Russ@@ el had to ap@@ olog@@ ise in the name of Mac@@ don@@ ald
he copied and added his ap@@ ology to over 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about Mac@@ don@@ ald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed and gave a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was made possible for them to be broadcast .
yesterday night we quickly ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our viewers on broadcast and our follow @-@ up in the social media .
&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments relate to the performance of flo@@ aters and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said , very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the broadcast and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention to be interpreted as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ olog@@ ise for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Squ@@ ad@@ ron in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have focused on the performance of the swi@@ mmer and not on it as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was inten@@ tional and I &apos;m sorry . &quot;
Pri@@ mark Bu@@ yer ou@@ tra@@ ged over woman who sham@@ elessly tried under@@ wear in the middle of business
&quot; the shop@@ pers did not know where to look , when a woman pulled off her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to try under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to make the situation worse , she looked like she looked at it , pulled her off and put her back on the shelf . &quot;
you continued to browse and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone .
the Pri@@ mark Business in the Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone where the woman tried the under@@ pants before she put her back into the shelf
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; People could not believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the lining , pulled out her own pants and trousers and tried her . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously did not like , as she put them back on the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same with three further under@@ pants before she finally decided that she liked nothing , and went out and went out . &quot;
&quot; she did not seem to distur@@ b that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who , under certain circumstances , would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how do you think that someone would take home trousers with someone who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to pull clothes out of sale after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and did not wash her .
&quot; a spokes@@ man of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident that took place on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question were taken out of sale .
how to protect yourself against weapons attacks with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video of Dail@@ y@@ enam@@ e.@@ com. &quot;
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ on Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you &apos;re approaching you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn the spe@@ ar around for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you get closer to you from behind , then you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and get out of the gun line , &quot; Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi says . &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ eleg@@ s and shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with the knee in the bar and twist while the attack@@ er bends before pain , the weapon in his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; at attack@@ ers who approach the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and beat the aggres@@ sor to the chest , then twist the gun out of his grip before moving backwards and directing the gun towards him . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it is Mi@@ z@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; but remember that if you &apos;re not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand@@ master , it &apos;s the saf@@ est way to hand over your money . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sch@@ ab@@ t for a guide his tongue at the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe
a British traveler under@@ mined his immune system and worms in a serious test by le@@ aking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and disgu@@ sting places of Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k switched his train to a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before finishing each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to get in . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to daylight . &quot;
&quot; the thought of le@@ aking the r@@ ins@@ ing knob of a train toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey across Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and their own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad after@@ taste in his mouth . &quot;
W@@ right became known to test the resistance of his bow@@ els by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public money to train stations to flush lav@@ atories of toilets , the task was definitely put to test by the immune system &quot;
&quot; in the film he said : &quot; already as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his test line showed a lumin@@ ometer count of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ometer rate of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet , which he refused to lick after their lumin@@ ometer number@@ ing over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands are of less than 60 &quot;
Mr. W@@ right and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places as the bathroom
&quot; in the film , he says : &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I &apos;ve heard in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing worse than that !
I will not lick here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ oren@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we conducted crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended up saying &quot; Let &apos;s Ian call us . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking only about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian , if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick , like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
of course there were things that made it easier for Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult .
I &apos;m glad that we recorded some of these dirty tricks on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all inter@@ viewed lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 per cent said that they occasionally use products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
A@@ soci@@ etal family destroyed before del@@ o@@ gi@@ ance social housing in S@@ alt@@ ash - Corn@@ wall
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social home after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because they terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ che@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , the housing cooperative was shocked to find the property in an ir@@ repar@@ able condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls showed g@@ aping holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house administration at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she was afraid that the apartment could no longer be repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live this way .
&quot; there are many things to consider , as this property is presum@@ ed to be considered not as beautiful as part of Corn@@ wall . &quot;
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also known .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had joined , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug traffi@@ cking , and excessive scre@@ aming , stri@@ fe and cur@@ sing . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; in the property , where drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn &quot;
neighbors said they saw them fighting on the streets and calling on the police regularly
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing shared her with her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw .
the delegates were che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said their life was made hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years alongside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that !
&quot; now that they are gone , it will become beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , Nei@@ gh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager of Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , testified that it would have given the family to cooperate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was called at regular intervals , 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , garbage and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family , as del@@ o@@ sion is always the last step to consider Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terri@@ bly involved .
&quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information we have provided . &quot;
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message convey@@ ed that anti@@ social behaviour will not be tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found more than 70@@ g cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
&quot; skel@@ don received a fine , after she had ple@@ aded guilty to the possession of a class B drug in commercial view . &quot;
&quot; she claimed that the money was for a grav@@ estone of her son Lee Skel@@ don , who died in a car accident in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; after they were homeless , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the house walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti .
police says that they will navigate rent@@ ers who don &apos;t stick to the rules of the house
&quot; Angela C@@ row from the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall said that the del@@ o@@ sion is a clear warning to the other tenants , who do not stick to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can act without self @-@ repro@@ ach , and those who have been har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal pan@@ i@@ cked after a flying military jet over@@ flies the beach
&quot; sun worshi@@ ppers at Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on airplane of the Air Force deployed an incredible crash flight
&quot; air forces admitted that it was on a training flight , but insisted that there was no safety risk . &quot;
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a flying jet crash over a full beach .
dramatic video footage showed how the military aircraft flew almost near the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the Whis@@ ks without seeing what was coming through the clouds .
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were pan@@ i@@ cked when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on plane was on a training flight to identify fishing boats off the coast , and so had to fly so deeply that this was the only way to recognize them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the jet flew slightly deeper than usual due to poor visibility due to the poor visibility , but the air force insisted that security was at no time at risk . &quot;
&quot; area fires have destroyed these summer parts of the Portuguese mainland , where also four people on Madeira Island came to death . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly as deep as a result of the conditions - heavy fog and smoke smoke , which restric@@ ts his view . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight in which the pilot had to identify fishing boats as part of the exercise
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sevilla - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the Du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup against the FC Sevilla , the return game increases three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ dar@@ in has to ab@@ stain from taking on N@@ ey@@ mar , the under@@ lined Cup@@ fin@@ alist and reign@@ ing Europe League Champion among others , who cont@@ ests with Brazil &apos;s Olympic football tournament . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie is missing Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the training , the German suffered a b@@ ypass in the knee , which clari@@ fied the objection of Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen in Barcelona have been competing for the status as number one for two years .
&quot; so far , coach Luis En@@ rique gave up a clear decision in this respect and made Bra@@ vo in the league , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most of the remaining cont@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; before the first gam@@ eplay of the new season , the Spanish Master has doubts about the fitness level of the crew , which was hum@@ bled on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool at 0 : 4 . &quot;
even at 3 : 2 in Pro@@ pos@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really know how to convince them .
&quot; Sev@@ ille again took the 2 : 3 defeat after prolonged in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid , striving for the second triumph at the &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with so far eleven winners , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition . &quot;
Ma Long in an own league to table tennis gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his fellow country@@ man and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,@@ 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the world @-@ ranking winner was awarded the Golden Grand S@@ lam with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and even Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ ros@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
it was clear that for the third time in a row a Chinese would take the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings .
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the record , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they didn &apos;t have any co@@ aches . &quot;
they had moved back to the grand@@ stand and left their prot@@ ectors on their own in a fair competition .
&quot; the matches until now I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang concluded . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alists with the China flag were pos@@ ing . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expectedly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first set .
then he set the pace on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only 13 points .
the superi@@ ority of Ma did not develop the expected ro@@ using match .
&quot; however , however , there were enough stunning ball changes to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ ros@@ ani won the game of bronze against the 40 @-@ year old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ final against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the Bel@@ ar@@ usi@@ an bred a rib@@ bed injury after that , after which he had to settle &quot; &quot; in the end &quot; &quot; with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; the Swedish Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) , by the way , had become Olympic @-@ Vi@@ ews in a similarly high table tennis age . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump cle@@ ars ″ massive problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US Repub@@ lic@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive worries , even in traditional conservative states . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump now admitted short@@ com@@ ings of his election campaign in the former Repub@@ lican strongh@@ old U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary , usually a large @-@ gauge and self @-@ confident , said something like concerns , as correspon@@ dents reported . &quot;
&quot; having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within their own Repub@@ lican camp , doubts pers@@ ist in their success in the battle for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have tremendous problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tr@@ ump from evangel@@ ical Christians who asked him for support in major states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; false reports about his candid@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media scene . &quot;
repub@@ lican grand bur@@ rows w@@ ob@@ ble
U@@ tah usually is a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ una in June , Tr@@ ump and his rival from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were equ@@ aled . &quot;
&quot; other institutions see Tr@@ ump in front , but not with the distance that is common for Repub@@ lican candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are considered endangered as well .
&quot; in an interview with CN@@ BC , Tr@@ ump responded to the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
&quot; he does nothing else than &quot; &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it did not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correctness , that &apos;s fine , Tr@@ ump said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tr@@ ump party has threatened to withdraw funds to support his election campaign , he should not be able to present any better survey data . &quot;
&quot; instead , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans want to resort more strongly to Congress . &quot;
Olympia : three @-@ dimensional fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C intends to set up a disciplinary commission .
Ken@@ y@@ as athletes face the second dop@@ ing affair at the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a coach home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee promptly agreed to establish a disciplinary commission to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary told that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800 @-@ meter @-@ runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this was reported to the Team Director K@@ eni@@ as of the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association has requested the IO@@ C for information on the case in order to make their own investigations , an IA@@ AF spokes@@ man announced . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IO@@ C , the IA@@ AF will evaluate the assessment , &quot; stated the IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and released himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , sent and signed the test , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as &apos;s Head de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics He@@ ads of He@@ ads Michael Rot@@ ich had been deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games . &quot;
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about upcoming dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was reported to have been arrested at his return to Nairobi airport . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , after numerous dop@@ ing contracts , the IO@@ C has been under special observation for a long time . &quot;
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls laid out by the IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be targeted . &quot;
&quot; the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted a great deal of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil , to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
&quot; as a result , WA@@ DA Kenya has taken from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner nation .
the athletes of the country won most med@@ als at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , alle@@ gations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a substantial mentality of sports fraud . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und asked for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had hired her in Russian athle@@ tics .
it was proven that in this sport it was performed systematically and systematically .
Russia &apos;s athletes have therefore been excluded from the summer games .
Salzburg &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli
&quot; in the Shakespeare @-@ Jahr , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic pair of lovers , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the West Side Story , Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ stein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled herself with the role of Mary a youth dream . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra pit , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchester directed by the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their tempo and melody .
&quot; it &apos;s a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bernstein &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
she re@@ members her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances .
the role of Mary has always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally exceptional ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is smart , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it is very similar to me , my Italian character , which I have as a Roman , &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist .
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is a tremend@@ ously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli adds the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his looks , it &apos;s his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a joy@@ ous approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; West Side Story &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ce and fan@@ ati@@ cism .
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ ert@@ ories went to New York , and the New Yor@@ kers did not want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as they were then . &quot;
59 years later the piece is still relevant .
&quot; London School Girl , which joined the IS , was killed in Syria &quot;
&quot; Ka@@ di@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , reported reports in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family found out about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the Boll@@ ywood group in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was sevent@@ een years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had planned to leave the war @-@ torn country and return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with it , to go to a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said Ak@@ un@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other school ma@@ ids from the east of London entered a plane in direction to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain candidates for the Supreme Court in case of a victory in Gar@@ land
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , the leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked gar@@ lands confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the sen@@ ate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes the next president will appoint the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court of Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
Rei@@ d said on Thursday during a telephone conference that Clinton expects Gar@@ land to choose &quot; with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not yet talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court judge for the US Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Nom@@ ination of Gar@@ lands , were mini@@ ons and hel@@ pers of the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
he also stated that Donald Tr@@ ump was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
tre@@ ads wants naked calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine works with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to create a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked humans , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us that his nude magazine differs from classic school play@@ boys as &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he believes that it does the calendar too .
&quot; we need to return to the presentation of timeless and classical nu@@ dity , in which both women and men feel comfortable and inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release on the release of the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community expects mass flight
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Stiftung Dialog and Welt , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
the Kurdish community of Germany anticip@@ ates at short notice with tens of thousands of protection @-@ seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany .
&quot; in the medium term , there could even be &quot; some hundred thousand &quot; , &quot; believed the chairman of the federation Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; following the coup attempt by Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kurdish community Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with several hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the president of the Union Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had already out@@ sour@@ ced Kur@@ d strongh@@ olds before months , 500@@ ,000 Kur@@ ds were fle@@ eing inside Turkey . &quot;
&quot; after the frozen put@@ sch , secular and op@@ position@@ ist ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that receives refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the commander @-@ in @-@ chief compla@@ ined about the targeted res@@ ett@@ lement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ c cities . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last big minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or expelled in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the Com@@ intern called for the Federal Government to be &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , there is a witch @-@ hunt against Erdo@@ gan critics . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding of Gü@@ len fans will anni@@ hil@@ ate the professional existence of teachers and other academ@@ ics .
&quot; anyone who doesn &apos;t fit and Erdo@@ gan pra@@ ises , sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and sec@@ ul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ close Stiftung Dialog and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the paper is referred to by calling on numbers from the Federal Ministry of the Interior , the Turks set out before the coup the largest group of asylum entitled asylum in Germany , recognised because of political persecution . &quot;
&quot; at the reporting date June 30 , this would have been 11.@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all recognised as the right @-@ wing certific@@ ations ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey they do not find themselves worthy of war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot;
&quot; the right to asylum in accordance with the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot;
&quot; Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot; &quot; &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the natives do not get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for more stupid than up to now it &apos;s not possible : summer holidays , heat and day @-@ to @-@ day elections - that bites . &quot;
the locals that are to be convinced by the campaig@@ ners are on holiday .
&quot; most travelers who are travelling in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , R@@ ügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not a local , so you may not vote for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : hel@@ pers who hang out posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers , and count out voices at the end , only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the electoral and last day of the holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign over the people . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in poll@@ s . &quot;
it is exciting to see how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and head of government since 2008 , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and im@@ pe@@ des a little with the people , just as his legendary prec@@ arious predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff did . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , seaf@@ ering has got cold feet and gives chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel blame on the flo@@ wering of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; her refugee policy , her &quot; &quot; We created this , &quot; &quot; accelerated the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is , if at the wrong time , at the right place , election campaign . &quot;
she has twice invited German chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel to major documents ; Merkel parliamentary election district is in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority from other federal states , &quot; &quot; accused Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; apart from that , the north @-@ east CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual election bo@@ oths on market places and in front of shopping centres with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; this , co@@ king , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union also noted that in the country , you have to crum@@ ble the base , that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any available in the expan@@ ses of the country . &quot;
&quot; the advice of the CD@@ U campaig@@ ner Kok@@ ert to his fellow campaig@@ ners is also self @-@ revealing : &quot; &quot; they must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : village festivals , golden weddings , any birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because there is much on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a very committed election campaign . &quot;
&quot; in poll@@ s , the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just ahead of the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the election of 2011 , the SPD was still able to win 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , the small party with seven percent in the poll@@ s , should make the leap into the Parliament day . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of the holiday @-@ need and largely lay out their election campaign on the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; calls the president of the country Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , green elec@@ tive fighters embar@@ k on a search for traces of local vocal cords among holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , curved straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the lakes of Mecklenburg . &quot;
your impression : &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 restoration : inn@@ s suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and end only at about 8@@ pm , there are all praise . &quot;
&quot; they made everything quite sha@@ ky , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no default .
&quot; the construction site could be moved to the south at half @-@ time at the beginning of the week , and everything will be ready by the end of October . &quot;
&quot; the award is also v@@ owed to those responsible for the construction work , for instance when it comes to setting up residence trips . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and the closure of the asphalt road in O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the site is relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now travel from O@@ fter@@ d@@ ingen to the B 27 on both sides .
passing through the place seems to go back .
&quot; in some cases , there were considerable complaints , &quot; says the deputy head office manager Florian King responsible for the traffic management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ ler@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many cre@@ eping paths were looking for and more familiar to their Nav@@ i than the signs . &quot;
what led to some trucks being fran@@ ch@@ ised in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed limits were not adher@@ ed to , the municipality also called for M@@ ös@@ singen vehicle . &quot;
&quot; there were significant over@@ rides , &quot; &quot; says King , who made himself informed about the situation himself . &quot;
two to three per minute have been heated .
the fastest was on the road at 77 km / h in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ zone .
&quot; since the construction site has been extended , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a little consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the street is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; however , the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to bur@@ gl@@ ary revenues , allows everyone to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; also at the deal@@ er@@ ship Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most slight decline &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that of course &quot; the drive is missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the locals along the road .
&quot; Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly a crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential threat .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have &quot; hit hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil were missing . &quot;
we must be glad about every Euro turnover .
&quot; the revenue losses were &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
street restoration took place &quot; two years ago . &quot;
he had to release half of his employees .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed , the policy would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27 . now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows about other land circles where so much more funding was handled .
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , pointing to the long history . &quot;
it can be understood that other regul@@ ars are now less frequently passing by because of the complicated traffic management .
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it &apos;s also somewhere else beautiful . &quot;
&quot; after the restoration work has ended , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner sees the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the largest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , it &apos;s brutal . &quot;
laws are constantly being scre@@ wed on in the name of the fight against terrorism .
&quot; according to recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is now presenting a thick security package . &quot;
but what does a tolerance status have to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the verse .
&quot; all his proposals are politically unacceptable to the coalition partner , &quot; said the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they do not overwhel@@ m anyone .
other further points would initially be discussed within the parties .
I also took part in this .
&quot; however , as Minister of the Interior , he was well @-@ positioned and at a &quot; &quot; real@@ is@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère took a little time before presenting his conclusions on safety in the Republic . &quot;
but they are all the more extensive .
&quot; some of them have already been announced , announced , filed : a new security authority to deal with the crack of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and weapons law .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère entered a second trial for proposals that had not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to raise sympath@@ ies for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; says the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he considers this to be reasonable and also requires nothing , which in the case of co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner does not have any chance anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas are presented by de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
&quot; they have , in part , in themselves : he plans fast procedures for de@@ port@@ ations and more possibilities for the incar@@ cer@@ ation of people before deportation . &quot;
refugees who are targeted in the country are to check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check .
&quot; in the case of Dul@@ ces for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their documents in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of it is politically and legally justi@@ fiable .
some of them are still un@@ explo@@ ded and leave questions un@@ answered .
and in some points - in the case of im@@ un@@ equal treatment of patient - for example - the question arises : what does it actually have to do with security and terror ?
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the issues refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Würzburg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people worried about security in the face of high refugee figures . &quot;
&quot; and things that deeply dealt with the people , did not allow themselves to be cl@@ inging up in election battle times . &quot;
the focus is on inner security .
&quot; first stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are political fights . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Union and the SPD are increasingly taking a stand on the issue of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , there was a high level between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a secret dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police , then a security policy idea collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the departments also demand a Bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a return from the double pass , he keeps nothing . &quot;
we have satisfied the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ plen@@ ish it is not reasonable .
&quot; and in case of a Bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitu@@ tionally stable at all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the co@@ ali@@ tion@@ partner , has yet to be demonstrated . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of things in it that could cause stri@@ fe .
but the SPD is also trying to gain a footh@@ old in the issue of internal security .
&quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first cau@@ ti@@ ously sign@@ alled a willingness to speak , saying , &quot; &quot; The SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
Volkswagen is still getting worse .
&quot; despite the diesel sc@@ and@@ als , deliveries are rising worldwide . &quot;
but it does not run around in all markets .
&quot; in the recall action , there are vor@@ ti@@ ces about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen starts sub@@ missions in the second half of the year .
&quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus in the course of the year due to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; but in July , VW &apos;s core brand weak@@ ens mainly in Western Europe and thereby again bur@@ dened the overall sales , as the company listed in the Da@@ x . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold a total of 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; sales in Western Europe alone , the second most important market in China , accounted for 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s quarter . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries dropped by almost one sixth . &quot;
sales of sales Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann led the weaker figures from July especially to two sales days less in Europe .
&quot; in addition , there was a purchase restra@@ int in some core markets due to &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation surrounding the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote on the exit from the EU also bur@@ dened the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the US , where the exhaust @-@ gas atmosphere first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus for beech . &quot;
the Chinese market is a great support for VW .
&quot; all in all , the primarily affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is already worse due to the diesel scandal : after the first seven months , only a distribution minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is reported . &quot;
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler was able to proceed from January to July onwards .
&quot; Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had been manipul@@ ated with a software exhaust system .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling some 2.5 million cars to re@@ fit into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the car manufacturer claims a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate for the customer after the retro@@ fitting , but I do not speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as stated on Friday in company circles . &quot;
the reasons are legal refin@@ ements .
the &quot; Focus &quot; had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee of upgraded diesel models .
&quot; last Monday , this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport . &quot;
the Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there was a meeting .
&quot; VW is fully compliant with the requirements of my Commission of In@@ quiry , and KBA . &quot;
&quot; diver@@ gen@@ ces are not accepted , &quot; said Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that in terms of fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance after retro@@ fitting , there are no deterioration and all vehicle @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen himself does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was said in company circles . &quot;
&quot; for example , the wide term &quot; guarantee &quot; gives Volkswagen the opportunity for customers to come into a workshop half a year after the change@@ over , for example - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage doesn &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the interest of customers , it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the waste market , to ensure uncertainty about possible warranty regulations , as stated . &quot;
therefore VW does not use the term &quot; warranty . &quot;
Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands from rich savers in future to be a criminal enterprise - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; on Thursday , managing director Josef Paul said : &quot; it is only about 139 people who park 40 million euros on sight deposits or day @-@ to @-@ day money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the German B@@ anks Association speaks of an individual case and does not see that there is no signal in it : &quot; &quot; normal savers &quot; &quot; would not have to worry about paying pen@@ alties for their savers . &quot;
&quot; if banks are depos@@ iting money by night at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay 0.4 percent of the penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee will be charged by Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund , starting in September of private and corporate customers for deposits exceeding € 100,000 on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 cost will cost 400 euros a year in the future , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; for some time now , he kept 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he could not exploit . &quot;
&quot; these lie with me on the central bank account and cause 0.4 percent of the costs , &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million Euro . &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter pays principle , he now passes the costs . &quot;
&quot; to leave the cash in the saf@@ es of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four attacks , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; &quot; said the bank officer . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
only a few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to bear it alone is not possible &quot; economically , permanently . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for this reason , some German banks have increased their account management fees , credit cards or bank transfers . &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian Volks@@ t- and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land made head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 with pen@@ alties for deposits of three million euros .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , CEO of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay compensation for deposits for deposits , the competition in Germany is much too strong among banks and savings banks . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said that at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; a clientele which is endow@@ ed with a little more luxuri@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; if it &apos;s free of charge . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , the cooperative bank G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ ta@@ ch @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and bus@@ ines@@ spe@@ ople live in the region . &quot;
&quot; currently no other banks are known to the &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; , &quot; which calculate a compensation set for deposits by private clients , &quot; &quot; said spokesperson ear@@ nest . &quot;
&quot; at the end of June , the president of the Bundes@@ verband der deutschen Volks@@ banken Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( BvR ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , declared : &quot; the threshold of going into neg@@ ativity towards private customers is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is tough , and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany will not fall in the width .
Dest@@ ination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle @-@ old love plates .
&quot; before you rush to the comment section , to hand it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ Alle@@ gr@@ á@@ ss@@ men &apos;s middle @-@ age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed revival of records does not result in a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght at the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
there is also no hor@@ des by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older turn@@ tables rather retain their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but do the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree ?
&quot; if this blog is a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soh@@ o , wearing a modest grey suit and game wild before I stop , hold my hands and take a bit of anti @-@ mood like : &quot; well , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even though the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops . &quot;
I would probably ask the c@@ amer@@ aman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to appreciate their age and mind by observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glas@@ gow , 55 , whom I follow from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into the Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight middle @-@ aged men , a woman , probably around the 20 ) , is a day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
is he a collector I ask ?
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; these records , pictured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I didn &apos;t follow him home ) , rev@@ et the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his dispos@@ able income : he is now able to buy records , which he could not afford , when she appeared and again buying items he sold , when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70 &apos;s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things that I was probably a little too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records tend to be more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot . &quot;
that is my truck .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works with Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are forced to buy their old records again . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations I have led , people usually have gotten rid of their collection so much about 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to supporters of a certain age record revision .
but what about the supposed emotional significance of records ?
it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers accepted the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from items that watch happy memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; a staff of a record pile is fl@@ utter@@ ing .
an IC@@ M survey in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month had not yet listened to them .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player who they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record have no record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I make a smo@@ other through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova compil@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle @-@ aged men ) has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the revival . &quot;
&quot; someone came in just recently and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I would like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead disc so I can put them on the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less music @-@ quality . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones , who come in slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated almost a whole floor to the records , has a lower audience than I was going to . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who take photos , teen@@ age boys and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest synthes@@ izer and sex@@ t@@ pack@@ er pop instead of experimental jazz bl@@ ends from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers .
&quot; none of them looks odd , but serious psychological trauma is hard to imagine when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around for a number of minutes and looks at the variety of plates that are available for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a window @-@ shopping easier than a big shopping bag .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way , but the beauty of records is &quot; ... &quot; it drives away with a de@@ ar@@ ded si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I &apos;m preten@@ ding to have the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen girls group together for a moment to group Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a cros@@ strainer turn@@ table . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of panels by Ad@@ ele , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mix of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; plate art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records . &quot;
&quot; even if my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v agree , they , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , let the large number of female collectors exist in reality , record stores and online forums . &quot;
these people probably work hard at school or in offices .

French court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of stores in the jungle refugee camps
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Cal@@ ais section in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be competent to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods , cigar@@ ettes , drinks , sell , offer hair@@ dressing services or tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and which could hold a fire and san@@ ity risk .
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also stated that the temporary stores and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses , but acknowledged that the concerns of the Cal@@ ais pre@@ f@@ ecture are &quot; absolutely comprehensible . &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than simply feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the low price was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café at the camp , which is operated in a community and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to maintain the Kids &apos; Café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that the closure was &quot; for these children a catastrophe , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle has risen to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in new arri@@ vals in the course of the summer . &quot;
despite Olympia @-@ disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
&quot; despite his dis@@ appo@@ inting performance in the Olympic season , Rad@@ mund@@ i Tony Martin doesn &apos;t want to be under@@ scored . &quot;

he did not have an explanation for his miserable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; to me it is honestly difficult to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
he must analyse in peace what reasons would have led to de@@ bac@@ le .

here comes the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation speed monitor : in different federal states , among others in H@@ esse and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , the tem@@ pos@@ jumps should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic @-@ looking En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler from the Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden can , for example , be used at accident focuses , where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on motorway construction sites or to renov@@ ating bridges with temporary temporary polic@@ ing there is often no need for infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits . &quot;
a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly .
&quot; the En@@ forcement Tra@@ iler is self @-@ sufficient : in case of un@@ interrupted measurement operation , its battery lasts five days , the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all vehicles can be detected at the same time using laser measurement technology . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as transit b@@ ans after time , travel strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in a state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art condition , the trailer can be connected to any car with trailer hit@@ ch according to manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not easily st@@ owed , it is lowered in the measuring mode , so that the wheels disappear in the arm@@ oured and by the way also a non @-@ slip case shell . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer according to Vit@@ ronic has been tested in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; even foreign authorities flas@@ hes with the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 items , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
United Kingdom fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by after Fi@@ ji Master@@ class Gold
&quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance at the 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hur@@ dle in the form of the Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were struck by a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium in Rio . &quot;
&quot; Fi@@ ji gave a master class in handling , side step@@ ping , back@@ rest , line run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any color . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the strong defeat of the boys , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but in this form , Fi@@ ji could have beaten a 15 @-@ man team . &quot;
&quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for the UK - but probably it won &apos;t - that at least one Brit@@ on tomorrow will have a gold medal on his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is chief trainer Ben R@@ yan , former chief of Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game among the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens under R@@ yan . &quot;
here they lost only one .
&quot; this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fi@@ ji began mira@@ cul@@ ously and left the attacks against G@@ Bs of fun .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell an and Co . an , as if one would run into driving bus@@ ses . the World Series winners went upwards 5 @-@ 0 , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au ro@@ ared in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner he turned around . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB rarely touched the ball .
&quot; a h@@ ack@@ le of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fi@@ ji . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , Y@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a ran a touch down in the right corner and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new since the whi@@ stle , and there was still a minute playing time ... in the first half . &quot;
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u comp@@ eted by further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med down to the line to make a gate .
the transformation brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it &apos;s like Fi@@ ji was born to play the 7 , while G@@ TC still se@@ eded . &quot;
this is how it is .
GB conducted fundamental changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for a whole four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed through Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant inter@@ play of Fi@@ ji .
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea Sul@@ li@@ ans , whose fans sang , flags sw@@ ung and danced on the tri@@ bun@@ e . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and GB chi@@ pped cr@@ ushing into the lawn . &quot;
in the past Fi@@ ji Japan defeated Japan in the semi @-@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a tight half @-@ fin@@ alist match from the race - Britain &apos;s transformation of the difference .
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks in the first half forward , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot work and scored a score among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ king by Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony the English 15 @-@ side team , secured the win - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by fight with the cancer of the trainer for a rowing victory
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ in@@ al@@ ers gold than these games and that wants to be called .
&quot; from the first strokes to the last 220 hard H@@ ieve that go into history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if there were only those who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the coach Robin Williams , was present when they row@@ ed for the second olymp@@ ag@@ old in a row without a hel@@ ms@@ woman , the first women in the history of British sport who made such a scale . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolute , after all , their 3@@ 9.@@ 1 un@@ fired operation , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant athletes , who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the type of triumph to go@@ ose . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in the row is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who make a difference to incre@@ mental advances that make the difference , and no one was more instrumental than the coach who didn &apos;t know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did that . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do so , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been quite a bad situation .
it changes a little the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , out of season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if this is the correct term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was in hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
this is how it begins .
rowing in itself is already a challenge but that makes it even bigger .
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve @-@ wra@@ cking morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; I was an emotional wre@@ ck this week . &quot;
it only repe@@ ats how much I have worked for and how much I and Hel@@ en and also Robin worked .
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we wouldn &apos;t be there , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best coach in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have asked for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Bell and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race in the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much reserve . &quot;
we were very trapped at the moment .
Hel@@ en called &quot; pale in the process ; stay in the process . &quot;
it is really important not to get carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want fire@@ works today , we just wanted to achieve a good result , go out and win the race , what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver has to appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I &apos;m an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
exemplary for clarity for 31 years
&quot; the managing director of the water utility company &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , is reti@@ ring . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavaria far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ purpose association as a model for large water producers .
that &apos;s how it was said some time ago in the original one in a contribution of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk .
&quot; little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia paid tribute to the association . &quot;
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe &quot; &quot; regarded Bavaria far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this stands Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was 31 years in the ken@@ nel associate , 28 years of it as managing director . &quot;
now he was retired at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ Group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , provides about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water per year and provides 32 places and ham@@ lets with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ heimer , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the town of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for further cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current president , Breit@@ brunn burg@@ om@@ aster Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed Managing Director in 1985 and appointed Managing Director of the Con@@ federation in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from the construction of water lines and maintenance work on office and organisational skills , budget@@ ary planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency approaches on weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chair@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; as outstanding events , she called the inaugur@@ ation and inaugur@@ ation of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new fountain ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the refurb@@ ishment of a central computer control ( 2004 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control ( 2004 ) and the partial renewal of water pipes . &quot;
there have been no stand@@ still and I have repeatedly added innovations because water life and drinking water is the most important food .
&quot; in her speech , she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over the age of 31 . &quot;
he has used a lot of lif@@ eb@@ lo@@ od for his water @-@ purpose association and he really lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company .
&quot; just a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe as a nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia region . &quot;
&quot; for that , he received a great deal of recognition and praise . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised Aqu@@ arian Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for the past twenty @-@ eight years . &quot;
he is the best wat@@ cher and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and the restructuring of the purpose association . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the most difficult task , however , were the rup@@ ture at the high tank near Kirch@@ enburg on January 3 . &quot;
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees , it was necessary to work throughout the night so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
&quot; the supply of new brunn can only be maintained , because the high tank of P@@ ett@@ stadt was filled with hoses . &quot;
the management of the drinking water sports association was handed over to Daniel Stur@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

Rel@@ ation@@ ship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots on a partner
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot at 10.@@ 45 in a multi family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district of Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on his partner and injured her mort@@ ally .
&quot; the man himself called upon us and indicated to have shot his partner , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator was on the run , after whom he was publicly prosec@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , because Sven S. could be on the road with the car . &quot;
&quot; the man is about 1.80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a bald . &quot;
meanwhile the police have published a photo of him .
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man we@@ ars bald . &quot;
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot;
&quot; if you see Sven S. , the 110 is to be called . &quot;
the police speaks of a &quot; Rel@@ ation@@ ship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck wanted to make no information about the departure or the relation between perpetr@@ ators and victims ; however , she confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
&quot; this is a killing crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not say more at this time , &quot; &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a Special Operations Command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene of the crime scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for the German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity production are from the table .
&quot; the German steel industry , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the West German Allgemeine Zeitung , said that it remains at the release of the renewable energies situation in the German steel industry , said Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West German Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) . &quot;
I am really glad that we could finally arrive after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; according to this , the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel told the WA@@ Z that there was now an agreement with the European Commission after talks with Com@@ miss@@ ar Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only if the generators are replaced in the steel units , an EEG lev@@ y fall of 20 percent . &quot;
but this too will not be raised in the steel industry either .
IG Metall welcome Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined . &quot;
Gabriel &apos;s successful endea@@ vor for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; with regard to our &apos; steel &apos; campaign , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; also in the reform of emissions trading trade , climate and employment targets are to be weighed down , &quot; &quot; explained IG Metall CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry in Europe suffers from over@@ capacity and substantial price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate when the world &apos;s largest producer country China threw massive steel onto the world market in view of the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers throw in Chinese steel companies price d@@ umping .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel have effects , on the other hand , economic prospects in China have accumulated . &quot;
it is unclear how sustain@@ ably the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , prices would have been rather stagn@@ ating . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; at the same time , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp decided not to exclude closure of individual works . &quot;
&quot; around 8@@ 6,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers are cau@@ tious in spite of rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year , just as the German Steel Association announced on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the produced quantity went back to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has risen by two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to an improved order situation , the association expects a rising output in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : sing good sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , she took music in the school choir , and today the 78 year old sings in a sen@@ iors choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall more alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good with her health and mind . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors from several perspectives , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler from the German Senior League . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of the music , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; through regular gather@@ ings , sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts . &quot;
&quot; often social and family structures dissolve in age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot; &quot; &quot;
singing can be exhau@@ sting in the positive sense . H@@ ac@@ kler says .
&quot; for this purpose , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
&quot; if you regularly require your lungs , you will not be able to get out of your everyday life as quickly as possible . &quot;
singing is an optimal hobby even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age .
&quot; for older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Working Group of the Sen@@ iors @-@ Organis@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , common singing had a much higher priority , it belonged to everyday life , both at school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people raises many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; due to song texts and especially melodies , even dementia suffer@@ ers learn about long @-@ term events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , the head also requires a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focusing on one &apos;s voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - that &apos;s a big cognitive challenge . &quot;
especially elderly people who live alone practice to concentrate not only on themselves .
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition , which one experiences through singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
self @-@ esteem is also growing by singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I practise for something long , I get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , so there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try a new hobby , don &apos;t hesitate - even if you think you have little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - in 50 singing people , who will hear when there &apos;s a sound next to it ? &quot;
&quot; looking for the right offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of friends in a senior choir , you can simply join them . &quot;
many towns also offer over@@ views over the cho@@ irs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly .
many sen@@ iors can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you do not have access to the Internet , please ask the family , friends or neighbors for help with the internet research . &quot;
&quot; those who desire to sing should necessarily join a choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says . &quot;
singing does good for the soul and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to any age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males on the cries of the k@@ itt@@ ens
bi@@ ologists have studied in Hannover which effect the fen of cat cell phones has on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also left the males not cold - however , they beha@@ ved in contrast to the females always the same . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of reg@@ ression of k@@ itt@@ ens at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they respond by ten percent faster on bro@@ o@@ ks of k@@ itt@@ ens , which are in great need , as scientists have found out of the Veter@@ inary College and the Hannover Medical School ( M@@ H@@ H ) . &quot;
&quot; males respond even to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however , always the same . &quot;
&quot; evi@@ dently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young animals for the males are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the M@@ H@@ H . &quot;
she is the author of the study published on this Friday in the journal BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Bi@@ ology .
&quot; in a previous investigation , the team of researchers found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens scre@@ ams differ with the ur@@ gency of their depen@@ dency . &quot;
nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the hus@@ band@@ ry of the M@@ H@@ H .
they were played for a lit@@ te of little ones taken from the sau@@ sage box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with cries of more strongly excited k@@ itt@@ ens which were raised additionally . &quot;
&quot; despite the small sample , the researchers keep their results meaningful . &quot;
&quot; all the females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
&quot; they turned faster to the speakers , when this rep@@ ut@@ ations were played by the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens . &quot;
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already investigated the reactions of women and men to baby sounds several times in humans . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women were more sensitive to babies , whether they were mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Dum@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski jumps with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r is a legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , an important football game takes place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the ri@@ vals of Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski &apos;s Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even when the state of emergency after the attempted coup attempt in July , the government was stun@@ ned to not distur@@ b the everyday life of normal citizens . &quot;
but this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len who is responsible for the coup attempt .
but football doesn &apos;t stop at the same time .
the prosecution issued an arrest warrant against the former strong Hak@@ an Sü@@ kis@@ r .
&quot; accordingly , South America living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ kis@@ r is said to be a follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is made responsible for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the state of emergency decre@@ ed for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact this has virtually no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the ni@@ ghtly &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country declared Erdo@@ gan for an end on Wednesday . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split in supporters and opponents Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the club &apos;s club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; what unites the majority of the Turks , however , in the face of dramatic experiences in history , is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; in the case of the cup winner &quot; Gala , &quot; Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski will once again arrive . &quot;
Cologne in the past season proved his sporting value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club .
&quot; in the final match against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce , he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit . &quot;
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured his team the tro@@ phy .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ appo@@ inting season for the record champion was a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round @-@ K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; lions &quot; &quot; also retired early in the Europa League . &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g only sixth place was enough .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; we managed that and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the game year was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the basis for the 14th title with 26 season hits as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ rema@@ enk@@ ö@@ nig . &quot;
this is also the reason that the fans hope to return to the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; on the other hand , the Gom@@ ez contracted by AC Flor@@ ent@@ ine had been declared to be only borrow@@ ed Gom@@ ez after attempted coup attempt , not to return because of the political situation in the country after his European holiday . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he just has to say it , &quot; commented the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club boss Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; to do so , however , the stri@@ ker would have to be ready to renoun@@ ce about one third of its annual salary estimated at 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man clearly stated : &quot; we cannot pay its salary in Florence . &quot;
despite dop@@ ing : these athletes still have med@@ als chance at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already locked twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ ova won &apos;t start in Rio .
other led Ath@@ le@@ tics sinners can only laugh about it - they fight for med@@ als in Rio .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games in Rio .
&quot; the Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who after a dop@@ ing barrier compla@@ ined her starting right just before the games , was whi@@ st@@ led and de@@ bu@@ ed mer@@ cil@@ essly at her start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot;
&quot; it was a bizarre scene : with a s@@ miles of smile , she was still in the hall and had provoked her appearance . &quot;
&quot; when it was fixed that she would not get gold , the audience broke out into a jubil@@ ee storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are still many other sports@@ men , who go to the start despite the D@@ oping past at the Olympic Games in Rio . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was already locked twice due to dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 to 2010 ) .
&quot; since its spell , the Olympic Champion of 2004 and ex @-@ world champion is even faster than before , he is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is considered the biggest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann F@@ ras@@ er @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ relay / Jamaica ) : the two times Olympic Champion and seven times world champion had to sit in 2010 for a six month block@@ age after it was detected using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , she had a strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che and defended the 29 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion , world champion of 2013 and European championships , was tested positively on the forbidden stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ ane from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied know@@ ingly in@@ gest@@ ing and was barri@@ c@@ aded for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est th@@ rows this year go to the account of the great gold favourite .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400@@ m @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and twice world champion more than 400 m , was positively tested in 2010 and had been locked for 21 months . &quot;
a means of penis enlargement has been responsible for eu@@ than@@ asia .
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world for over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan Ti@@ ch@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athlete has been recognized as many med@@ als afterwards . &quot;
thus Ti@@ ch@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing .
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympia @-@ Silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid @-@ dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title because of testosterone ab@@ uses .
he also received the bronze medal at the 2008 Olympic Games due to a verdict of the International Ath@@ le@@ tics Court CA@@ S .
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walk , China ) : the world record holder and gold favourite was tested positive only in May , but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champion , evidence of taking a forbidden dietary supplement was found , the lock of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency WA@@ DA was mil@@ de and expi@@ red on 13 July . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian injured - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian embassy in Thailand is in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she had suffered cuts and had been treated at the hospital , but I have already been able to leave this . &quot;
she planned her home trip for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he are also Austrian citizens , it is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , says Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ a H@@ in , some 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , initially explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , among them the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; Friday morning , two explosive charges went up again , and another human being was killed according to the authorities . &quot;
also from Ph@@ u@@ ket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning .
&quot; during the det@@ on@@ ation near the popular beach of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police instructions . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , another bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territorial police . &quot;
&quot; finally , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g were demanding on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ om@@ p@@ he on the south @-@ east coast several wounded . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same hand@@ writing , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning in front of journalists . &quot;
we assume it is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves about possible motives , but it is probably a matter of the actions of the Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , stated that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist rebellion or international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; instead , one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta have been laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have received secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - though they were not informed about the exact date and places . &quot;
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
&quot; the police force their officials across the country to increase the security of major government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but usually they do not turn against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace used for years by Thai King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; according to the actual bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security ( security level 3 ) was applied to the provinces Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ bro@@ a , as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its environ@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there will not be any necessary trips to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution made by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military a great impact in the coming years .
&quot; said Jun@@ ta chief and prime minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs have been an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , will benefit itself to have brought the Kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military did not manage to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed . &quot;
almost a year ago in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hin@@ du shooting 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists .
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the country &apos;s recent history .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection . &quot;
&quot; after several national offices , the Constitutional Ju@@ dges in the Federal Government have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; , we see evidence of efforts against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; &quot; said the Chief Executive Officer Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ je@@ k of the German Press Agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants from Islamic beliefs or from the Middle East are diff@@ used in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
this is why we are watching the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ W@@ ahn , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional prot@@ ectors in nine states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - are already observing the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ isha said , his authority was closely aligned with the state offices when deciding on the decision . &quot;
&quot; groups like the &apos; identity movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Chief of the Constitution . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with juven@@ ile language , often with pop music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is no concrete advertisement for one &apos;s own cause .
the propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports of contacts of the &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several federal states . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ isha said , I have no knowledge about that . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the party - in this case - the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , will change their direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have control over the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in legal off@@ ences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ je@@ k said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be law @-@ terrorism .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it may well be that further right @-@ wing terrorist groups or small groups form , plan the attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee camps or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of legal terrorism , however , is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
&quot; Ma@@ das expressed concern about the fact that many en@@ cro@@ ach@@ ments went to the account of people , who had not previously appeared in the right scene . &quot;
this is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects of attacks on asylum accommodation were previously not known as criminals , politically motivated off@@ ences or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different , or have chosen CD@@ U , SPD or Left , who , however , radi@@ cal@@ ised themselves through right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
&quot; not always , the Olympic champi@@ ons or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games . &quot;
this shows the courageous appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te at the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; at the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight swi@@ mmer from Ethiopia was so slow that he could no longer be seen in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the neckl@@ ine was selected .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ rat subsequently became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old finished his previous race with a gap of 48 seconds and took the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not exactly sporty character which attracted the attention of the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to promote swimming in sub @-@ represented countries .
&quot; because most athletes run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ asi@@ t just wanted to do something different . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the lap .
some media called him &quot; Ro@@ ckets of W@@ hale . &quot;
&quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; made fun of him in reference to a &quot; &quot; good b@@ ang &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; his time , he only hit with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 metre fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; have also been drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , the run by Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i provided media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the swimming pool from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to start riding alone in a pre @-@ run over 100 meters of Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically , m@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time . &quot;
&quot; the 22 year old , at that time , learned about swimming at least eight months before the Olympic Games and had never completed such a long distance before the competition . &quot;
a seat in the front row for the breath @-@ taking architecture of the Central Library of Los Angeles
&quot; learn more about the history of the Central Library in the city center , as the Society of Archit@@ ec@@ tural Change / Southern California Chapter holds a Salon with Arnold Schwar@@ tz@@ man and Stephen Ge@@ e , the authors of the new book &quot; Los Angeles Central Library : a History of its Art and Architecture . &quot; &quot;
it is planned that Ge@@ e and Schwar@@ t@@ mann pictures of 1926 Ber@@ tram Goo@@ dh@@ ue designs as well as the 1993 Rest@@ oration and addition of Har@@ dy Holz@@ man Pfei@@ ffer Associ@@ ates will discuss and share .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a new store in the New Place has been char@@ ted .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in left their business on Monday at 5.@@ 30@@ pm , forgetting to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when she came back at 8.@@ 15 o &apos;clock the next morning , about 250 euros had disappeared from the cas@@ hier . &quot;
traces of the perpetr@@ ator could not be found .
video surveillance is also not available .
Tr@@ ump does not see the lo@@ oming electoral defeat so close
the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump speaks at a campaign in Florida .
&quot; should there be nothing with the election of the US president , Donald Tr@@ ump has an alternative video . &quot;
he then goes on holiday .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump loses the US presidential election in November , it doesn &apos;t matter to him : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the Repub@@ lican Candi@@ date in a telephone interview with the U.S. TV station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it does not suff@@ ice for him for reasons of political correctness , that is fine , said Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; he described US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance formed . &quot;
post rises in stores with electro @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric delivery vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies on the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oters as well .
&quot; in the near future , the Group intends to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the postal service wants to offer its electric v@@ ans on the free car market as of the coming year .
&quot; we want to get into the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the company has been examining for months whether they will be delivered to their self @-@ developed Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oters , with which letters and pack@@ ets are delivered , also to sell to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post managing director Jürgen Ger@@ da had said that there are always inquiries , for example by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; according to information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group plans to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; in post @-@ production manufacturing , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot;
Ger@@ da announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and build a complete change@@ over to the environmentally friendly vehicles in the long term .
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we can change the entire fleet .
&quot; since 2014 , the Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads . &quot;
G@@ FR@@ P leadership decreases after dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges Matthias Hart@@ mann .
&quot; the back@@ sliding suddenly came , but not quite surprising . &quot;
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K showed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will become even more in@@ secure , the longer the success promised by him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after renewed dis@@ appo@@ inting business figures and the res@@ ignation of corporate management the world &apos;s number five is facing a new start .
G@@ FR@@ P CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , already dischar@@ ged from the Supervisory Board effective September 12 . &quot;
&quot; the management board of the board of directors , Gerhard Haus@@ ru@@ ck@@ inger , took over the management board as early as 1 September , and divided the company . &quot;
&quot; he should officially take over the function of a &quot; &quot; spokesperson &quot; &quot; until a successor is found for Hart@@ mann . &quot;
the company called &quot; different views &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation .
&quot; on Friday , a company spokes@@ man did not want to mention details . &quot;
&quot; in future , those who will be conducting market research firms will remain unclear at present . &quot;
&quot; in investor circles it was stated on Friday , among the shareholders the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced years ago . &quot;
Mr. Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring are not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in view of the recent bad fi@@ ber@@ glass business figures , any shareholder will become rest@@ less at some point . &quot;
&quot; if that were the case with BMW , that would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company would not be able to stop its loss in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; at 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales fell by 6.1 percent below the level of the comparable prior @-@ year quarter . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , sales contracted by 3.4 percent to EUR 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter were chi@@ ef@@ ly affected by the decline in value of the company . &quot;
&quot; the company value depreci@@ ation of 139 million euros , which became necessary in the Consumer Experience business area , gave the Group a loss of € 14@@ 8.2 million . &quot;
&quot; in the second quarter of 2015 , the Gf@@ K still generated a net income of 19.@@ 7 million . &quot;
accidents - bus slides into Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
&quot; in the event of an accident involving 43 senior citizens as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , reported the police . &quot;
&quot; according to her information , the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach had to escape from an opposite truck , which partly drove on the opposite race track . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch , as reported by a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund . &quot;
&quot; due to the location of the bus , people could not leave the bus autonom@@ ously , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ gade liberated the in@@ mates .
six emergency ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the provincial road 2 .
the un@@ hurt travellers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kr@@ um@@ m@@ audi@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , the fees for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ det , 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros for the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ det , will amount to 3.@@ 36 euro ( previously 2,@@ 26 euros ) and 3,@@ 64 Euro for Az@@ endorf ( up to now 2,@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will be increased once again if appropriate measures for improvement are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after a late calculation , the sewage cost in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , in the approval of the household by the County Office Kul@@ mb@@ ach , it was found that for these sewage plants under@@ cover under@@ cover . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the market of Kas@@ endorf is obliged to operate the plants in a cost @-@ covering manner . &quot;
&quot; from 1 October 2016 , citizens and industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to go deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as chairman of the board of directors Herbert Schmidt presented to the Board , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; over the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover caps from the previous calculation period were also to be equ@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt explained that there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water supply , lying between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low de@@ part@@ mental basis . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , due to their age refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses , the previous calculation period in all three plants had fallen to a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is nearly 30 years old , the facilities for Wel@@ sch , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p nearly 20 years old . &quot;
Schmidt indicated that in the wastewater treatment plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to damage .
&quot; after almost 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be excav@@ ated , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be evacu@@ ated , the sewage slu@@ dge had to be installed and an additional vent@@ ing option had to be installed in order to meet the requirements of the water regulations in future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses resulted in the continued assistance and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which are still significantly below the current level in the previous calculation in the years 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the three plants the expenses for the operation and maintenance are &quot; full &quot; in the three plants .
&quot; Schmidt , the market community of major entertainment costs , has been spar@@ ed in the last 20 years with great entertainment costs . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to remain prec@@ arious in the long run , especially as the supply area of the waste water association Fri@@ es@@ en@@ ba@@ cht@@ al is not possible to expand these facilities because they are defic@@ its . &quot;
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria in July was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared with the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 1,@@ 0@@ 1.0 % , i.e. monthly inflation amounted to 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed : food and non @-@ alcoholic beverages ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices stayed as in the previous month in alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect critici@@ zed as Asian carto@@ onist
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say that it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filtering tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders on the absurd . &quot;
&quot; you can transform yourself into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be from Roy Licht@@ enstein &apos;s painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are imm@@ ac@@ ulate , self @-@ rotating tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all false appearances come to the public .
Snap@@ chat filters have been criti@@ ques in the past when they were accused of using the app Black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; when it proposed a filter to some users this week , which gave them sl@@ otted eyes , false teeth and dark@@ ened che@@ eks , some critics called it a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow fac@@ tions . &quot; &quot;
they asked themselves if these repeated controversi@@ es referred to a larger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat announced that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was intended as a tribute to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature from Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who have experienced racism , the filter rec@@ alled inf@@ ring@@ ing c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others decisi@@ vely rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely spread across the photos that the filter was &quot; &quot; hur@@ ting and mild &quot; &quot; unpleasant . &quot;
she added that &quot; it is difficult to argue with the ju@@ x@@ tap@@ osition of a very contradictory asi@@ an car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ si@@ ghted , but that the yellow face has been pulled into the absorbing extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tri@@ pping kite .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more vers@@ er than their older counter@@ parts in terms of race - could expect more likely to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats filters creates an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it &apos;s much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for media and in a telephone interview , she said that she believes racial @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the attitudes of attitudes at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and finished her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that has largely left Snap@@ chat un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a speaker , the company recently hired a HR officer focusing on under@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu , for her part , said she &apos;s closing her Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users than us to say that this is not O.@@ K. . &quot;
&quot; military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence , sets Congress Committee &quot;
military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on site in a report on Thursday .
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of Repub@@ lican members of the Army Com@@ mittees , secret service committees and military budget com@@ ics , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command &apos;s intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence reports , typically inspired by high @-@ level Cent@@ Com com@@ man@@ ders , regularly featured a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism when the actual conditions were allowed on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ Com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; declared Ken Cal@@ vert , Repub@@ lican member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives . &quot;
the leadership mistakes in the Cent@@ Com are reaching the top of the organisation .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence suggest@@ ing that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts have exposed themselves to pressure from their previous laws , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sulph@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigations , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Repub@@ lican Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the heads of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigations will continue .
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ Com reports are underway by the Ministry of Defense &apos;s general inspec@@ tor . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , the democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Repub@@ lican task force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com has created an exc@@ essively restricted trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; said the high @-@ ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this trial , &quot; Mr. Shi@@ p , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; proclaimed the morality under analy@@ st and &quot; gave dispro@@ portion@@ ately little room for differing opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Shi@@ p and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at the Cent@@ Com analysts with regard to a &quot; specific political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Be@@ ast .
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor who , after complaints by Cent@@ Com analysts , was reported . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a Pentagon spokes@@ man , admitted in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress , while the Inves@@ tig@@ ations of the General In@@ spec@@ tor are still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also admitted that &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ gent opinions about the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by an American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of intermedi@@ aries of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ Com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush , contrary to the recommendations of many analysts , fores@@ aw just a small occupation force in Iraq and made little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in revol@@ t against current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker noted that , contrary to the statements of the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , as these temporary refin@@ eries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ al commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his excessive positive app@@ rais@@ al of the situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US gains fourth match in women &apos;s field @-@ hockey , a show@@ down with the United Kingdom &quot;
&quot; one day after shooting three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am made the first two goals for the American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember ever having done that . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind .
&quot; she knows , however : the American women lie at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Brit@@ ons on the first place , which remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first placed will be the strong Dutch slightly longer out of the way that lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the American women have triggered a surprising twist by their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey ra@@ cket in her hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 as she couldn &apos;t qualify for the cad@@ re .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which everything went wrong for her and her team . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , coach of the national team and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
we didn &apos;t have the work@@ around in London that we now have .
we have been able to s@@ nat@@ ch the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the gates in the first half of the game with a back@@ lash from the close range .
&quot; India had gone into play without victory in the tournament , but the team was surprised and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into her hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and le@@ aped the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the U.S. go@@ al@@ keeper , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous matches . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position , &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; amid the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of tramp@@ ol@@ ines &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro have a constant and inevitable appearance , a ra@@ ging season between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod , which is passed from the cross@@ bow to the swi@@ mmer to the tur@@ ner for tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour in the queue in the queue , without listening to Sim@@ one Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ ak@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s flock of dimples , could have been among those known names that are sent to Prime Time based on sponsors and feel @-@ good @-@ TV advertising if he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , tur@@ ner or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized : air@@ gun shooting , ar@@ cher@@ y , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it rule for a long time .
&quot; but if I should be modest arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the tramp@@ ol@@ ines have been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it made its debut in Sydney , the last 16 years have been so spar@@ se that many of those I had asked weren &apos;t aware that it is at all an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the United States had prepared athletes for competition , it has never won a medal in tramp@@ ol@@ ines and until 2012 had an athlete who managed it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London .
&quot; jumping on the trampoline has some out@@ si@@ ders , partly because it sounds more suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ mic than the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has a hum@@ orous potential - the carto@@ on@@ ical trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending impact - but also the Gra@@ zie of gymnas@@ tics and diving , the two sports that essentially unite . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; Tramp@@ oline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; asp@@ iring winner jumps on a giant trampoline , shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to draw a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on the feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympic program , they are rated as level of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio . &quot;
the most common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ sts , in their quest for gold , have to go farther , faster , upward and over , sometimes up to the finish , sometimes back and forth , up and down on the playground . &quot;
&quot; they not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall , but also a further highlight in the broadcast transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; the goal @-@ directed quest is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even beat a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I feel as a bit ti@@ ring when looking at these games .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she ki@@ cks off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then down , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; here too there is competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be .
&quot; the qualification and end @-@ hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in the streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end times as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the terror and the objective of male athletes - according to The Wall Street Journal , the male US gym@@ na@@ sts recently proposed - then Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan base . &quot;
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protest in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government .
witnesses testified that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during the clas@@ hes with the police in gun@@ fire .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
&quot; over the last ten years , it has been one of the most stable countries of Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in the last months , protests against the government sh@@ ook the country and expanded into more and more areas . &quot;
&quot; last week , thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that police were shot and killed in ump@@ teen un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; in circulation , videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year , show how security officers beat young people with sticks , while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights authority now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Cris@@ is Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to combat terror driven beyond the region , especially Somalia . few countries in Africa , if at all , receive so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable rate .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital Ad@@ dis A@@ be@@ ba .
&quot; the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ ses of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; &quot; said Sea you@@ m Tes@@ home , a teacher in Central Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth prot@@ ested .
one generation prot@@ ested .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from the use of land to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding the power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; following a widespread election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , tensions continue along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a struggle for this jag@@ ged , controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den , who have been enforced more or less in recent years , could use the turbul@@ ence and be able to arm themselves . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bitter@@ ness explo@@ de under the surface after years of har@@ dening under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially in protests , many people can still communicate via internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians confess that they gathered in such a way as protests .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons Am@@ per@@ as , who mainly come from Ethiopia , prosp@@ ered in politics and business as they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of which are Muslims and live in flat @-@ land areas . &quot;
but that is also changing .
&quot; we are working under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Mi@@ ech@@ u , a leader of the O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ per@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is un@@ fairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and which are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , until his death in a non @-@ public illness in 2012 for 17 years , Ethiopia &apos;s prime minister . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tactical genius , a man who could think of corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was especially vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to manipul@@ ate opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this fundamental skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiop@@ ian new Prime Minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was selected for relatively obsc@@ ure reasons to take the position of Mr Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; different from Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of Northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time Ethiopia experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after prot@@ esting thousands of elections which , according to the analysts &quot; statements , apparently were fed by the government and subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the following ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even if it was less than in the last months and this time of tur@@ mo@@ il went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but apparently this has not prevented the intensi@@ fication of the internal de@@ mis@@ e of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes on a dangerous ethnic form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ per@@ ical city , of Tig@@ ray conducted business and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring US and other Western allies into an odd position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over neighboring Somalia , although she recently announced that she closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump explains his claim that Obama has established IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tr@@ ump , on Friday , tried to sc@@ atter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by ang@@ ing that his multi @-@ repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton were the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not meant seriously . &quot;
&quot; this clari@@ fication drew new questions about the communications capabilities of the presidential candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ si@@ bly with the American public . &quot;
&quot; it also brings together his fellow campaig@@ ners , who endeav@@ our to take protection during an event@@ ful phase , in the peculiar position of explaining statements that he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tr@@ ump re@@ marked with respect to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest the president and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the tweet was the opposition to the previous day , in which Mr. Tr@@ ump said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tr@@ ump wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate would not want to know anything about it . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism fell down on Mr. Tr@@ ump , while trying to draw the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to declining demand . &quot;
Mr. Tr@@ ump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Mich@@ ig@@ an this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump tried to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring . &quot;
Mr Tr@@ ump has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to chop Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; &quot; Of course I told the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tr@@ ump to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back as needed .
&quot; I think it &apos;s one of his methods to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans as they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; according to what the reaction is . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tr@@ ump has estimated an even more corro@@ sive sound as his survey values declined further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey conducted by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a major lead in the federal states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ in @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tr@@ ump has generally tried not to excuse himself for his pro@@ voc@@ ative remarks , he often critic@@ ises his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while empha@@ sizing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tr@@ ump Scher@@ ze brought his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him , no matter how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements might be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent speakers in the world , had a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani said he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Tr@@ ump@@ back &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama , IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called them back@@ bit@@ ers , completely wrong and that &apos;s why it happened because he pulled out the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tr@@ ump made his attacks on the media , and accused them of being overwhel@@ med and bi@@ ased at each of his words . &quot;
&quot; he mo@@ cked the &quot; poor , miserable &quot; TV experts who tried to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats mo@@ cked Mr. Tr@@ ump &apos;s excuse as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presidential office .
&quot; once driven by market price , Green@@ point is coming back to Café in Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a shame cafe in Willi@@ am@@ sburg where you could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but for 15 years good coffee served . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prizes from his Bed@@ ford Avenue store front were displaced . &quot;
&quot; the business So@@ ap Cher@@ ie , sold in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
&quot; as the last loss , local people kidn@@ apped it in a genetically modified city . &quot;
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , except the Chelsea Hotel , and Ver@@ b is now a soap shop . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is change , then it &apos;s also re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened in Green@@ point last November , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time associate of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new café . &quot;
he started working in Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a client offered to provide funds for a new branch office , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , kept a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; there are sand@@ wiches with bacon and cheese on the menu , and there are gar@@ n@@ ishes such as cap@@ ers and sau@@ te onions . &quot;
there are nature char@@ ters .
&quot; the café serves no beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prices from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , on a Sunday , Rebe@@ cca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg earlier and visited the club regularly . &quot;
&quot; even after she moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she gave up the coffee for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was in the coffee and culture that I liked , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even if she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of her usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long@@ standing and faithful customer since the start of the club in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss torch clock and they cook my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and record new ingredients in the menu .
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still gets his usual ordering , but sometimes he replaces his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bacon , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he did not win a gru@@ dge against the fact that the soap business occupied the old business room .
&quot; in fact , the owners of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered a special soap for mixing with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the café as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we &apos;ll go to their offer yet , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
and the traditional Polish inhabitants of Green@@ point have also accepted the café .
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he has prepared to issue them soon , so that his new neighbors feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice local wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into bottles .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighbouring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is enough to get their old favor@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said he was devast@@ ated by the ground when the café was closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee like a hom@@ ec@@ oming felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his accession to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roos@@ ev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a gourmet , President Roos@@ ev@@ elt had a passion for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue like P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land Tur@@ tle Sou@@ p Sou@@ p . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , potato pu@@ ree and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Bri@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband , Andrew Co@@ e , added , &quot; It was also a message to Americans how to eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; the last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; was from Chinese cuisine in the USA , while brick was told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; their latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will be published on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , fri@@ lls snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; as the re@@ porter appointed min@@ ced meat , this found the couple appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ inn@@ ed .
&quot; it must have put itself in the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an All @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at @-@ Buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women boiled for male fields and it was served freshly baked pastries for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during World War II . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; records the ways with which the country was going to be no longer the land of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when eating for Americans became a central , ten@@ se issue , &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new Bud@@ get@@ own was just as ten@@ sed : mysterious food , such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ole , became a stap@@ le food that could recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues as a &quot; &quot; wonderful way to recy@@ cle food resi@@ dues &quot; , &quot; as the coo@@ ks were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a creamy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the centre of American cuisine for years , became a rare luxury . &quot;
odd mixtures have been tried out as a calorie rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction is given preced@@ ence over taste or even healthy kitchen .
&quot; during their research for the book , which also includes prescri@@ p@@ tions , brick man made a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was no popular additive at noon , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
Ziegel@@ man further explains : &quot; it was sur@@ real .
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the household recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , budget econom@@ ists - among them Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics between 1923 and 1943 - think of the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; &quot; house@@ keepers &quot; &quot; and to turn the challenge of turning P@@ amp@@ e like creamy sp@@ aghetti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; is a feast of historic treats . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ me @-@ Cake @-@ Essen @-@ attitude , are particularly tasty . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa Far@@ mers &apos; kitchen in his kitchen , he was feeding as the million@@ fold man of the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in an almost gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was wonderfully realistic .
President Roos@@ ev@@ elt might have made the same mistake if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or would have called him to cancel an example with his stomach .
&quot; as described in the book , the recru@@ iting of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors through Mrs Roos@@ ev@@ elt said that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
&quot; many of the species from the era of Great Depression , dealing with food , was rejected as soon as the country returned to the legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy is on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of a brick @-@ in @-@ law mother &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law , for example , how they could not throw away food . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of food waste , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
&quot; the brick was rec@@ alled , &quot; &quot; They really made people sick . &quot; &quot; &quot;
there was the wind@@ fall incident .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e brought out a dessert which they had prepared at home : the pl@@ um dessert that President Roos@@ ev@@ elt ate for lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man , adding that it was a trick to miss a fancy name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone showed a little reluct@@ antly a spoon in the t@@ ines , brown gli@@ b@@ bers . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it was not bad .
Co@@ E took three times a supplement .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ ge@@ ti@@ erer he said to his wife , &quot; &quot; A few hack@@ ed wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in bomb attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people in Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything in order to save lives .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old has died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a group of civilians who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60@@ ,000 lives . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game in order to draw people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civilian prot@@ ector showing him during an 11 hour rescu@@ ing of an inf@@ ant from the ruins of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syri@@ ans a shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; as a hero , however , he never saw himself , said according to the picture : &quot; for me this is the real Ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die in saving life , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; just before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he talked about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Alz@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
&quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb so that children do not play with it , &quot; the image rec@@ ites his final words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime was supposed to hit terrorists .
Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ hai : the oldest verteb@@ rate is nearly 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland &apos;s sh@@ arks usually only come to the surface in winter .
&quot; after an investigation , this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea aboard the research ship S@@ anna . &quot;
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie get offspring only at 150 years of age .
&quot; lei@@ surely , the Gr@@ ön@@ land shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the bottom of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is on average at an average of just 1,@@ 220 metres . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a rich 2.6 km / h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterised by slow@@ ness , seems to be a patent for a high age . &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal Science at least 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock , comments on this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland hair will become stone age .
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland h@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland @-@ sh@@ arks .
her slow motion measured her when she with@@ ered six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitz@@ bergen .
&quot; nevertheless , this sh@@ arks thri@@ ve : in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
they may hunt dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol on the bottom of the ice sea and look for cad@@ aver who tor@@ wards from higher water layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland hooks that fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re was measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins it contains will not be renewed later . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; therefore , its birth was supposed to lie after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons research hur@@ led large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers length , the lens core , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons . &quot;
&quot; in their l@@ enti@@ l core , however , all larger Greenland h@@ arks had normal carbon @-@ 14 @-@ amounts formed by cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock showed an age of 3@@ 35 years for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter long , while the record shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ res was even 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known .
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
&quot; as one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood on the threshold to maturity and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with multip@@ lication is obviously at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
it is no coincidence that such methane @-@ caus@@ tic areas live mainly in icy waters .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , in which bacon at the neck was a 120 year old har@@ poon tip , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame @-@ flame . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are also often very big . &quot;
the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the loss of heat of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than in one gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very big animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources in a long life . &quot;
building ground in double @-@ pack
&quot; in the recent meeting , the municipal council has focuss@@ ed heavily on topics relating to building . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the Board accepted the release of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; finally the marketing of recently reported residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the development , par@@ ting and closing questions were clari@@ fied and the requests for survey could be made , the sale of the plots in residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schö@@ nau @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( section 1 ) is nothing more in the way of interested parties . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community of Schö@@ nau attract young families and senior citizens alike .
&quot; as it was said , building volunteers can now announce themselves in the Town Hall , discussing the allocation of the plots , the municipal council is expected to advise in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; the municipal council decided to change the land use plan , which was newly created in the spring of this year , in order to also en@@ qu@@ ire further businesses related to job creation . &quot;
&quot; for example , the trade area that has already been declared there will be extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; therefore , the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London by competing with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it vote , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses may continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; so far , approval in the United Kingdom is enough for the so @-@ called EU passport . &quot;
that is why big US banks are taking advantage of this .
several banks have already announced that they will shift jobs .
the lobby association &quot; Frankfurt am Main Finance &quot; reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs on the Main within five years .
&quot; for Frankfurt , according to the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , which combines responsibility for monetary policy and over@@ sight of the largest banks in the euro zone , as well as other important authorities such as the European Insurance Super@@ vision E@@ IO@@ PA and ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) is headquartered in Paris , but this is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; while Luxembourg has a large fund industry , it also cuts out less than Dublin for infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the large airport , Frankfurt is much easier to reach . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the city with readily available commercial properties . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not so easy to find free high quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , the rent for first @-@ class commercial properties is 50 percent higher than on the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good health care and infrastructure , as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the company consultants Mer@@ cer , the city is at number seven , Luxembourg in place 19 , Dublin at number 33 and Paris at 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference : &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; concludes the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but despite Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial center in Europe , the economic researchers think . &quot;
&quot; in London , according to the figures of the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba , around 14@@ 4,000 people worked in the banking industry at the end of 2015 , in Frankfurt it was 6@@ 2500 . &quot;
Gilead acqu@@ ires legal costs from the hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
a U.S. office judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc claimed to be entitled to a refund of the legal costs incurred from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C dispute with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc .
&quot; in June Gilead was freed from a compensation payment amoun@@ ting to $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge exposed a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including per@@ jury and other un@@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; when the complaint was collected on Thursday , U.S. official Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the expense incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to align with Gilead , which controls the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can heal more than 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck acc@@ use each other and claim ownership of laboratory work involving Sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the US say they have re@@ conquered full control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; troops backed by the United States have re@@ conquered full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j , near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city have left them , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the demo@@ cra@@ cies of Syria ( D@@ KS ) stem from the movement of the remaining group of fighters , who have buried themselves within the city , currently the city . &quot;
&quot; they delivered more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , and shared Shar@@ p Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j military council of Reu@@ ters , al@@ lied with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we are currently conducting clearing up , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Clinton receives 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pays 3@@ 4,@@ 2 % federal taxes &quot;
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday their tax return for 2015 , which resulted in US presidential candidates and their husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Hill donated USD 1 million to char@@ itable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former President Bill Clinton had almost USD 5.@@ 3 million in Rede@@ mption ; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million from the publishing house Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster for its office in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candid@@ at for the vice @-@ presi@@ dency , Senator Tim ka@@ ine from Virginia , together with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton , published his tax declarations for the last ten years . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; stated Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tr@@ ump hides behind false exc@@ uses and re@@ vis@@ ers in relation to his previous promises to publish his tax returns . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax returns , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax audit by tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign assistant to Ian S@@ ham on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tr@@ ump Special Ad@@ visor , told CN@@ N that he would not allow Tr@@ ump to release something before tax reviews were not completed . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Tr@@ ump Cri@@ tics , including the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate of the year 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already proclaimed that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , donations for char@@ itable organizations , its business relationships and various other links , in particular with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already over@@ thrown the issue and released a video on the Internet on Friday , asking high @-@ ranking Repub@@ lican Tr@@ ump to release his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she also addressed the subject during a speech to the Economy in Mich@@ ig@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done during the last decades and publish his tax returns . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reported that Tr@@ ump has paid no or only very little taxes during the 1990s , and an economic journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax advis@@ ers on Friday , stating that this could still be the case . &quot;
&quot; in the election campaign , federal taxes have become an issue . &quot;
&quot; Clinton supports a scheme named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett , which would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million pay a tax rate of at least 30 % . &quot;
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away Industrial Con@@ glomer@@ ate here has his seat , Tr@@ ump to discuss their tax declarations . &quot;
Buff@@ ett said he had also been subjected to an I@@ RS tax check and Tr@@ ump was afraid of the voters and not before the tax authorities .
Clinton &apos;s Camp@@ a@@ ign has published tax return by 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , now living in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , aver@@ aged an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of about 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the 2015 Clinton &apos;s tax return showed that it was only USD 100 of its income as a salary , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment position was a cost @-@ effective Inde@@ x@@ fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

&quot; con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders , fire@@ works support Tanz@@ anian eleph@@ ants protection &quot;
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going back to inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them that are filled with ch@@ ili@@ es .
&quot; the method proved effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , who had the idea for years ago , intensified its promotion together with the US natural protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , using a non @-@ violent four @-@ step method to protect their homes and crops without inj@@ uring animals . &quot;
&quot; previously , many sp@@ ears used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is the Wel@@ fare Convention dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitudes within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can keep the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the eleph@@ ants , &quot; said the Managing Director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell . &quot;
the first two steps include the lighting of the elephant with a torch and the bli@@ ster into a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; chim@@ e cloud &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
mixed with earth is packed together with a fire@@ work body into a con@@ dom that ends up to the ignition threshold .
&quot; when lit , the con@@ dom rup@@ ts with a b@@ ang and spra@@ ys fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders into the air . &quot;
a hint is usually already sufficient to chase the elephant .
&quot; one last option is a laun@@ cher who shoots a Golden fire@@ works engine into the air , causing a loud , bright explosion . &quot;
town council unanim@@ ously decides : no new building at St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er investment projects of commercial operators with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and are assuming the retail trade in the core town as clearly expan@@ sive . &quot;
&quot; however , the application for the new construction of a sales sco@@ oter on the Rhine bank in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balconies in the building was now unanim@@ ously rejected by the city council . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of principle , we welcome new businesses , but at this location in an exposed position on the Rhine bank , this ki@@ osk doesn &apos;t fit , &quot; said Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot;
&quot; Jewish director breaks Berlin hotel , because Israeli pre@@ fix was removed after &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; prompt - RT News &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots captured a media clock after betra@@ ying that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin did not list Israel &apos;s pre @-@ election , as it would have requested Arab guests according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
during his last stay Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country code list of the hotel .
&quot; the country was not listed between the countries , which can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and extingu@@ ished ? &quot;
wrote to Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel from its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; &quot; sho@@ wered him &quot; &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel employee said that the measure was a &quot; deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management . &quot;
the reason behind it spark@@ ed even more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the preliminary selection be cleared , &quot; the cler@@ k was quoted by Lanz@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; big dis@@ grace &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were app@@ alled and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very sham@@ eful .
the fact that this happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even greater shame .
this requires no explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to &quot; draw the right conclusions , &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather big response on the Internet , in which people called the whole a scandal . &quot;
some subordin@@ ated to the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that there would have been the alleged &quot; demands of Arab guests . &quot;
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; said it in another article in which it was pointed out that the hotel , which is located on the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm , is close to a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all accus@@ ations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , Der Spiegel reported . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct assignment &quot; to not include Israel in the quick selection list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code has been added now .
police set up tear gas &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sa@@ o Paulo together with the police when they assembled to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police used tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to diver@@ t the students , which led to the police regi@@ stering rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations in order to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the governor of Sa@@ o Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are converted to save money . &quot;
some of the protest participants were seeing gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been removed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an increased by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year @-@ on @-@ year comparison . &quot;
&quot; since international sanctions have been lifted against Iran , interest in the sides of Russian companies has increased sharply in the country , the ambassador stated . &quot;
Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran while new companies are ready to gain access to the market .
&quot; of course , further expansion is one of the major priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
&quot; he noted that in the first five months of the year 2016 , the trade turnover between Russia and Iran grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million . &quot;
&quot; in particular , Russian imports increased by 9@@ 1.5 percent in Iran and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade boom has been achieved by deliveries of machinery , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan goes from a record number of Iranian tourists to Russia this year .
&quot; last year , the Russian foreign agency issued some 35@@ ,000 vis@@ as , primarily travel visa , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year are broken , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , relatively few Russians visit Iran , something from which the ambassador hopes it will change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d , who have received monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
looking for witnesses : drop drink market in forest oil
a rob@@ ber@@ y raid was carried out on Thursday evening to the beverage market of Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the backing of a gun , three dark @-@ dressed people who had framed their faces demanded cash from the employee of the beverage market and then fled first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been exploited , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 metres , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly visible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; after the attack , the perpetr@@ ators have to run towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and flee from the gravel parking garage located opposite the car park entrance to the silver @-@ colored car , possibly towards the B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who made observations at the time of the crime ( against 19.@@ 45 h ) , which are related to the rob@@ ber@@ y affair , should urgently report to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : fun and fun during summer@@ time
&quot; eight beautiful and joyful days spent the children and young people of the social pedago@@ gical day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their car@@ ers during their summer break in Nuss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet , lying Lei@@ theim neighbourhood , the joyful group was lod@@ ged during the first week of school holidays . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
&quot; on the one hand , we went to B@@ rescue with the visit of the pet@@ ting zoo . &quot;
&quot; on the other side to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guidance in the world @-@ famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about everyday life and the food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days , the group am@@ used in the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swimming and plan@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; culinary delights were given to children and car@@ ers with their own prepared meals like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ger Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in workshops , beautiful pieces of jewelry made of pearls and stones were made or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te E@@ ven@@ ing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of the journey home , the sun and the children and young people were happy . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the altar boys from the Ey@@ acht@@ al Eye Hospital St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were completed . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time until the next Rom@@ ance trip of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the round of mini@@ stries St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgri@@ ma@@ ges were tested and one finally decided for the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al City of Freiburg , where this year , on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy with the opened gate of mercy at the Freiburg Min@@ ster , a special pilgrimage destination was offered . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is from B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gru@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch and Hei@@ ligen@@ zimmern made his way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Father Stor@@ my sent pilgrims to St. Anna in a small celebration , blessed the pilgrimage and told the pilgri@@ m &apos;s blessing . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b there was a train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where there was also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er Lieben Frau Frau . &quot;
&quot; the individual tours were framed by a short impulse with different prayers , songs and written texts in the morning and evening . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the min@@ is of field crosses , chap@@ els or churches always made a r@@ ast to sing together a song from a specially assembled pilgri@@ m @-@ song . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the par@@ ishes of the local parish stood at their disposal . &quot;
&quot; at the stage , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller provided a tasty and strengthening dinner and breakfast . &quot;
on the second day Fur@@ tw@@ angen follow Gü@@ ten@@ bach on the second day .
&quot; after that , the trip to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , had to be climbed up to about 500 metres altitude and then climbed again afterwards . &quot;
the earned reward was a common barbecue at the bath@@ house in the evening .
after the morning pulse on the fourth day of the pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter it went to the final stage to Freiburg .
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gates of mercy . &quot;
with a little impulse God was given thanks .
&quot; in the evening mass in Münster , Min@@ is received by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t , who arrived at the destination , were welcomed . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the city of B@@ reis@@ gau .
in the afternoon we went by train back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong communal experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last night in the men &apos;s team spr@@ int in Vel@@ od@@ rom in Rio to fame when the British team announced the London 2012 title .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glas@@ gow took the anchor , which his comp@@ atri@@ ot Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made his own . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , England claimed a sho@@ cking victory while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic med@@ als . &quot;
they repeated the trick after they picked up only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of the appearance of Ho@@ ys .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff .
they did this in time as a hin@@ dran@@ ce .
Ho@@ ys retirement produced a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y winning - and Sk@@ inner used the qualifying rounds as an olymp@@ ic record , but in the standard rounds , the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it .
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hin@@ du went in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and , above all , Sk@@ inner to keep the pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ der when they got on the podium . &quot;
&quot; 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glas@@ gow said , &quot; It &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
&quot; in the final round , we set up an Olympic sailing ch@@ ord and defeated the world champi@@ ons . &quot;
it was just incredible .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the victory in 2012 at the Kenn@@ ys and Ho@@ ys page , Hin@@ der admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track . &quot;
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
&quot; said Mr Hin@@ der : &quot; &quot; it feels like the whole GB of flags on the tri@@ bun@@ e like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team in the last three months .
we came so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which has won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress in the last five months we expect successful five days in the bicycle flash .
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible to repeat Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold med@@ als in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23rd ( a seemingly holy date for British sport ; on that day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold med@@ als and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be equal to that of Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y is now taking part in the spr@@ int that starts today and will go for three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always the best .
you can win it with your colleagues .
it feels a little lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold med@@ als , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 at the finish .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on safety .
&quot; yesterday , he had argued with representatives before the qualification , when function@@ aries called him to measure his body size . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women &apos;s competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand@@ , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ ga@@ vie in world record time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to take a host of med@@ als .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , expectations for Rio have been shut down . &quot;
&quot; Dra@@ mas took place in the background , with the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April in the midst of sex@@ ism and mo@@ bbing demonstrations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks like the now legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated . &quot;
future of the melt @-@ sm@@ el@@ ting of Port@@ land due to the suspension of energy yield question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium melt from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers &quot; work@@ stations - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby canc@@ els all delivery contracts , such as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the government &apos;s decision at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
&quot; up to 2,000 jobs in the Al@@ coa plant in Port@@ land are at stake . &quot;
not less than 2000 work@@ stations - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered in case of closure .
&quot; in addition , there could be dom@@ ino effects since the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa concluded Point Henry Mel@@ ting , leading to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the sm@@ el@@ ting of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , supplying the large aluminium melting facility with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ robe Valley , announced that three other owners will termin@@ ate their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through sm@@ el@@ ting , &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were so @-@ called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging business &quot; , &quot; which should come into force from November 2016 . &quot;
the contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017 .
&quot; consequently , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17 , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impact on the revenue on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 is currently limited by the forecast of strong retail prices for wholesale electricity prices .
&quot; AG@@ L announced that it had already depreci@@ ated the value of the contracts in its annual subsi@@ dy amoun@@ ting to $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; &quot; Termin@@ ation of Termin@@ ation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the tre@@ aties , the &quot; Al@@ co@@ as &quot; ability ... to operate the melt or to guarantee the electricity supply to the melt &quot; does not compromise . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , which would have come into force from November this year even if it is still an explanation why it has withdrawn from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the industry before closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; referring to the analysts &quot; statements at the beginning of the week , Head of Operations said Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen , that Port@@ land use some 600 MW of Mega@@ watt and Tom@@ ago to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts each year . &quot;
&quot; if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generator , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner C@@ lans Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the US vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on their Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover brought me to tears , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or just Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like that ? ) , a craw@@ ling reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) as well as in the presence of the universally popular Show@@ bi@@ z @-@ uncle and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ rest : they all have planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é plot almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ rem@@ nant took the phrase , &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , certainly a new era of das@@ her@@ eh has begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as far as Vo@@ gue covers were concerned ( they and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were on it in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold issue of the year for vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a volume that resembles more an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the output draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the un@@ v@@ eiling of his cover stars is eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine went through even before the official announcement .
&quot; women who have already been on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years there have been clearly more &quot; celeb@@ ri@@ ties , mod@@ eling &quot; as &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar winner and brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , a year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the little chance that Ms. Jen@@ ner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation , falls under the earlier category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to celeb@@ ri@@ ties or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video ( even if everything is true to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success is not pleasing to everyone . &quot;
&quot; with her reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ er &apos;s position in the world of fashion has always been somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critic@@ ised them and called them &quot; the mist@@ let@@ oes of the moment . &quot;
these feelings were once again high when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but going around on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
she runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
you and all your sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells photographs of Cin@@ dy Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine &quot; LOVE . &quot;
and in her free time she is to be seen in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; community centers run 160@@ ,000 people every year &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s aid needs are annually rejected by the municipal services centres , while the industry is preparing for the effects of other short@@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ o@@ gi@@ ations and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already at full capacity , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , it is planned that these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
&quot; the director of the Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ r@@ ell Municip@@ ality Centre , said that the last survey of the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been rejected every year . &quot;
Far@@ r@@ ell said that the situation without repe@@ aling the decision of the federal government would only be worse .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s city centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means thousands of people from major services that you need are rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with un@@ man@@ a@@ geable and oppres@@ sive debt , families that go through separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ ju@@ stly - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the federal government will cut funds by 30 percent in June 2017 , meaning that thousands of vulnerable people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General Alban@@ ian At@@ tor@@ ney and Justice Minister and Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately lift up these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government met its commitment to raise funds for legal assistance to the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their customers , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government inv@@ ests in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump Ele@@ ction Camp@@ a@@ ign accused after collabor@@ ating on alleged weapon
&quot; new York : Donald Tr@@ ump@@ backs Camp@@ a@@ ign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after you have been told that her campaign manager for North Carolina put a gun on a staff in February , while in February they were travelling in a je@@ ep . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , filed on Wednesday at the State Court of Charlotte by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software programmer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
ordin@@ i admitted for months to have been waiting for the matter to be resolved internally before he realized that &quot; that would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign director , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and ra@@ mm@@ ed the course in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; gave B@@ ordin@@ i in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after compla@@ ining to the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ord@@ i found that at least four more people had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he stated in the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; said B@@ ordin@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the accus@@ ation came only two days after the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate ev@@ oked a tur@@ mo@@ il when he told a crowd in North Carolina that &quot; &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; &quot; should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge should appoint . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump &apos;s campaign clearly stated that the media would have torn away its words from the context , and that it would not inc@@ ite to violence . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Co@@ ordin@@ is &apos;s complaint demands compensation from the campaign for breach of duty of care and of Philip , for bodily injury and lasting psychological damage . &quot;
s@@ ling@@ backs press spokesperson Hope Hi@@ cks was not able to achieve a statement .
attempts to contact Philip were just as bad .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; not responding to calls from his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Repub@@ lican presidential candidate Donald Tr@@ ump has conducted a controversial campaign . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : poll@@ s before elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Western Pom@@ er@@ ania ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling parties are notable . &quot;
this resulted in representative surveys from the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could reign in the north , this is not possible according to the survey figures in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have a good chance of continuing to head the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent in five years to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Parliament &apos;s day . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens hesitate to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses of 6 percent ( previously 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented at least 3 percent in the Parliament &apos;s day .
&quot; according to the poll@@ s in Berlin , the vote for the SPD is only 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U only reached 23.@@ 4 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; they are still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the House of Repres@@ ent@@ atives .
&quot; with 5 per cent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return , while the pirates would not miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; email and internet in slow motion : twenty years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator launched the market . &quot;
the success@@ ors dominated the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed nearly half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thi@@ cker and bigger , therefore it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite cl@@ unk@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory initially amounted to eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would now suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; just 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , the &quot; Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator &quot; entered the shops - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few Euros , fans can buy the devices on the internet , but they somehow come from the Internet age &apos;s Stone Age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the C@@ eb@@ it trade fair in Hanover as an office in the west pocket format .
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for those standards : SMS and emails could be sent and received , also by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even accessing websites was possible by HTML browsers , albeit slow . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 Euro in 2015 .
&quot; in August of 1996 , no one could suspect that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smart phone era . &quot;
everything has changed ever since .
smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia .
the Finn@@ s mobile phone business experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold and handled at Microsoft .
&quot; today , vendors are domin@@ ating the market that came much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; to be online anytime and anywhere , this is everyday life for a lot of people . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion units sold were sold , and Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
worldwide sales are around 400 billion euros .
&quot; to this end , the well @-@ running business of countless app providers and telecommunications companies is coming . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has emerged around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the key breakthrough to the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , at that time Apple CEO Steve Jobs posted on the Mac @-@ World the introduction of the iPhone . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a telephone and an Internet communic@@ ator to easily operate everything by touch screen . &quot;
Apple &apos;s triumph@@ al procession began even today the iPhone is the most important product of the company .
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who ruled the market , had the look . &quot;
&quot; they eventually disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the Sa@@ gen now have Apple and Asian vendors like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after his invention .
&quot; on average , every German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to put the smartphone away , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in the Siemens executive board . &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ ath@@ row
He@@ ath@@ row will not only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and throughout London .
&quot; for me it was the biggest attraction of He@@ ath@@ row , just like in 2012 in London , when we made a great effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics had great benefits for Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ ath@@ row .
&quot; for our local communities alone , we will create 10,000 new jobs alone , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of He@@ ath@@ row &apos;s expansion is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ am@@ ant on the world stage .
&quot; the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 , and they will also be wrong with He@@ ath@@ row . &quot;
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ ath@@ row answers any question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ ath@@ row is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in economic growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both to the airport and the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team in He@@ ath@@ row , who implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - which was built for five years as a result of the world &apos;s best airport terminal , until the T2 , which was built in the midst of the two bu@@ si@@ est cat@@ walks in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of He@@ ath@@ row will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and to bro@@ aden He@@ ath@@ row as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies earning money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass the ad blocking , a &quot; cat and mouse game . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , just two days after Facebook announced that it would block ad block@@ ings on its desktop site , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it said users could update their filters in the program to re @-@ block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the encoding with respect to his adver@@ ts to make it more difficult to detect which part of the page advertisement is . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it had found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams &quot; spokes@@ man wrote that &quot; this kind of hate @-@ and @-@ forth struggle between the time @-@ cur@@ ving open source community and the hang@@ ers has been underway since the invention of display block@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying trend indicators have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study published last year by Pa@@ ge@@ air and Adobe , around 200 million people worldwide use display blo@@ wers ; almost four times as much 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of advertising revenues Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company has reported it on desktop PCs because mobile ad block@@ ers do not have an effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
advertising on desktop PCs makes a large proportion of revenues so Facebook can make the investment of such a step as worthwhile .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook shared that it would update its &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; to give people more control over their targeted advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be new filters wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot;
ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt tool which is why we have instead concentrated on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences to put more control into the hands of people .
woman in suspected su@@ ici@@ dal suicide on Swiss motorway
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed on to a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway .
the incident occurred shortly after midnight on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police officer said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , who was over@@ powered by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have still not been identified , the police told them , as well as every witness of the incident , to report himself . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative process was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared with the Le Tri@@ bun@@ e de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held ac@@ coun@@ table .
&quot; in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway , as stated in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a police officer was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing , after passing over and killing a man who was laying on the A1 near Pay@@ erne in August 2014 . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and was unconscious on the street , took the court . &quot;
&quot; the court found that the polic@@ ew@@ oman , who had responded to an emergency call -- drove to a justified way and that the presence of a man on the street was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday in the vicinity of Morges should contact the police at number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus once inhab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably once inhabited . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere could once have re@@ treated similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to shelter life and protect against rapid evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the g@@ ISS model simulation , the slow turning of Venus highlights its daylight @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained Keller scientist Anthony D@@ el Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously thought by planet researchers .
&quot; although it was supposedly inhabited , Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light in the course of several billions years . &quot;
their oceans evapor@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burned away from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; when her Hydro@@ gen escaped , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy joins the A@@ val@@ an@@ che as Trainer
Patrick Roy res@@ igned on Thursday as a coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che and led to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association will immediately search for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of Colorado A@@ val@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination , &quot; said the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; during the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give it more depth , needed it and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the vision of the trainer and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly att@@ un@@ ed to that of the organization . &quot;
he must also have a right to co @-@ determination in decisions affecting the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; today Patrick has informed me about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organisation and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy has been awarded the Best Coach of the League during his debut season at the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he took the club to 112 points and the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the Pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed the season in each of the two last years . &quot;
the A@@ val@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 brand in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the game for a second Wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference for five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with the Montreal Canadi@@ ans and the A@@ val@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; gre@@ y@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , strike off strike &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the labour struggles regarding the remuneration for the North Sea workers are suspended while all the parties involved in a new round of talks will sit at the table , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group have been spor@@ adi@@ cally conducted on platforms in the North Sea operated by Royal Dutch Shell .
&quot; the Wood Group , as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT Uni@@ ons , can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of the current dispute , &quot; &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot;
&quot; we will hold some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks , which will start at the beginning of next year to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , Wood Group has shortened the rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 per cent as a result of negative market pressures . &quot;
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 % decline for on@@ shore customers in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to come through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; shell has dismissed thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its operations as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure because of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which had reinforced the European Union &apos;s decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the Scottish parliament , Dave Anderson , met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes ever taking place in the North Sea for a generation . &quot;
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country we need an economy that functions for many and not just for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion in spending on new projects in the North Sea is expected to be around $ 7 billion in the last five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures rot@@ ational rate of stars in the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the newest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to gather the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates under the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
&quot; the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars rotate in star cluster to different rates , as well as in what context the rot@@ ational periods are associated with planet creation . &quot;
&quot; we hope that through comparing our results with other stars , more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is 4@@ 45 light@@ years distant from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , are now reaching adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning the fastest .
&quot; at peak rot@@ ations , these mature stars rep@@ el large amounts of star@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; since these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aging , its rot@@ ational rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by real@@ ising the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the most recent catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars are slower than less solid stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with bigger stars turning slower than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be more massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; as the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal Cos@@ mic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities like rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of the stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to know more about how , how , when and why stars slow@@ ed down their rot@@ ational rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the rates of rotation of the P@@ lei@@ ades , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball game ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez than the US bas@@ eball Star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotional withdrawal , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys one last time on August 12 , Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
&quot; I love this game , and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say goodbye to &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; , the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game competi@@ tor of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) said . &quot;
&quot; three times Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has awarded him $ 27 million annually since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on December 31 , 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach - with full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er , 3@@ 114 Hits and 2021 Points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marin@@ ers ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 he has created the Yan@@ ke@@ es some mil@@ estones . &quot;
the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys show only two other bas@@ eball players in the most important statistics .
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old should not be admitted to the Hall of Gl@@ ory of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
&quot; because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was on the field , so controversial is his appearance outside the square . &quot;
&quot; already in 2009 , the super@@ star admitted to &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 banned ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked up for 2@@ 11 games due to an involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ gen@@ esis scandal by the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered the main suspect to have received performance @-@ promoting funds for years through an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a legal dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 encounters . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done a favour to me for 2014 , because I have played through 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , at the time , sweet . &quot;
even his farewell @-@ days don &apos;t run no@@ is@@ elessly .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends play the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job includes the attempt to win every game , &quot; &quot; et@@ ched Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to actor Cameron Di@@ az and the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy for the fans of the Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ arch@@ rival Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sang the followers with the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez @-@ Team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : little X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ail@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing test , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland may not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
a wi@@ ped ath@@ let would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing attacks have become known to the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; Chinese swi@@ mmer@@ ers Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter steep@@ le in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ail@@ ova from Bulgaria and Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately prior to the start of the critically reviewed athle@@ tics competitions this news came to an end . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was detected last Sunday , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
the International Sports Court CA@@ S confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games on Friday afternoon .
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old took fourth place in the fin@@ als over 100 m of butter@@ flies , but only 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en would have taken over 50 m of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ Trial and a hearing were requested at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; &quot; very seriously and demands full co @-@ operation with the investigations &quot; , &quot; quoted X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sport Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , it is no longer the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also at the night of Rio the news came across the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on the offensive himself . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV channel B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; she was innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; said the Ath@@ le@@ tics Ath@@ le@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it is believed to be the dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O in the banned substance . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ail@@ ova was suspended for the time being , according to B@@ NT the B @-@ sample should have already been positive . &quot;
Bulgarian Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately responded with criticism of the bul@@ letin .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t pull the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ contaminated nation must not take part in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case was also known as &quot; Adrian Dest@@ in@@ sky , &quot; the London Olympic Champion in the class up to 85@@ kg has been tested positive for the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot;
&quot; both deny the intake , but both are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of athletes , the case of Dan@@ ail@@ ova is another serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Association IA@@ AF has banned the entire Russian squ@@ ad except for systematic dop@@ ing , including the L@@ äu@@ er Nation Kenya in Rio many bad news . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the swimming sport , the earlier transgres@@ sions in China also ensured fierce disputes between the athletes . &quot;
so Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic Champion Sun Y@@ ang .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ ly purple . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium above 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to pass it over , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t on the French radio . &quot;
sun was also the focus of a debate with Australian M@@ ack Hor@@ ton .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing sc@@ amm@@ ers , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; sun was positively tested by the Chinese nationals in 2014 on the stimul@@ ant Tri@@ met@@ azi@@ dine , but only had to shut down a three month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de black@@ ers black@@ ers their ran@@ som
program@@ mers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful .
&quot; according to a recent survey by the malware anti @-@ defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes ( among 540 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany ) , 40 percent of the companies sur@@ vey@@ ed in the past twelve months have been at least once , partially victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
forty per cent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som demanded by the perpetr@@ ators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data .
&quot; according to Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes &apos;s observations , the perpetr@@ ators are speci@@ alizing in attacks on corporate networks . &quot;
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to black@@ out ran@@ som is much higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently observing a start@@ ling rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Executive Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ tur@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the software programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks was sc@@ ary over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once active on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
the software then presents the demands of the black@@ mail press .
&quot; to get the final code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ currencies Bit@@ coin - . &quot;
&quot; but where private users are interested in the personal photo database at stake , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production stand@@ still . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage occurs when a ran@@ som@@ ware hits . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of the German companies affected reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely break the business activity , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of records .
&quot; we always say to the victims : don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; says K@@ lec@@ tur@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will get their data back . &quot;
&quot; in view of a stand@@ still in operation , it is difficult for managers to reject the demands of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
the hack@@ ers in turn know that and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure tested the user interfaces and the contact with the black@@ mail users and came to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims per chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set free accessible support sites , or de@@ code for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies have to negotiate hard and pay 5 @-@ digit amounts to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; in view of the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail , hack@@ ers become more and more professional and share their work , explains security expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider Sop@@ ho@@ s : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware around within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that they are three or four persons . &quot;
the program@@ mers sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the former malware test kits have been created by the fact that the malware , consulting and additional tools have been purchased for a unique fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included is a adjustment tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail@@ ers are looking for additional hack@@ ers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service industry .
&quot; so one logs in one of the forums on the ground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and asks another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
payment is per infected calcul@@ ator .
&quot; the criminals usually deleg@@ ate sp@@ amm@@ ers to dis@@ sem@@ ination , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known among many companies that better secure their data .
over 50 per cent of the companies &quot; IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey put their trust in ran@@ som@@ ware by file @-@ back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful assessment , the offen@@ ders threaten to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or price escal@@ ations instead , &quot; says Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Executive Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ tur@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the damage potential , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the perpetr@@ ators could in future take completely new targets on the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the Hack@@ er@@ konferenz Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the release of such a blocked radiator could be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also be a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V , Honda wants to pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é , and the versatility of a mini van . &quot;
&quot; sounds fairly over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz , actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the HR @-@ V only affects only 1.@@ 60 m , the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the rear . &quot;
&quot; the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the upper side of the cockpit is falling apart . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l at high @-@ placed and 10@@ 26 l with folded back rests , but there is the Magic Se@@ ats . &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the back@@ rest can be folded up like the seats , offering storage space that is 1,@@ 24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the boot is well loaded , but the height of the cargo is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR @-@ V very power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; however , he should do his job sof@@ tly . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is pleasing .
there is another engine : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
an all @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be somewhat more direct .
&quot; the equipment in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security systems include the city emergency braking system ( working up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane assist assistant . &quot;
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; when manoeu@@ v@@ ring .
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic sign detection and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed when needed .
&quot; but the full connectivity is only available for top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation system , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI jack are located under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some to achieve .
&quot; the roughly 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will get the petrol engine starting from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel of 23@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger bridge
an airline shall not be liable for the fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that liability is only conceivable in case of dangers that are typical of aviation .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a kne@@ ec@@ ap in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation to the man .
case of illness : when does the organis@@ er get paid ?
&quot; after their trip , ill vac@@ ation@@ ers will only get money back when the cause of the disease can be found in the hotel without any doubt . &quot;
but this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have shown the same symptoms .
&quot; in the case of a trial , a family was severely ill with diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their tur@@ k@@ il holiday . &quot;
she spent almost all the vacation in the room .
&quot; their disease caused the vac@@ ation@@ ers to return to a defective wastewater treatment plant , which allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water . &quot;
the family believed that the trip was so poor - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs did not succeed in court proceedings .
&quot; in fact , the wastewater treatment plant was defective . &quot;
but the organizer received notice only shortly before the departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ff .
until then he had to assume that the sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not viol@@ ate his duty of information , thus the judgment . &quot;
especially since no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion - belonged to the general risk of living .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère said , after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined to react to acts of terror at the same time .
&quot; for sure , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and sch@@ ism . &quot;
we will not grant this triumph to terrorists .
&quot; if criminals would have to leave the country more quickly , however , the security and strength would also increase the approval of the people for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère aims to implement the proposals up to the Bundestag election in 2017 .
&quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; in a medium four @-@ digit order over several years . &quot; &quot;
sympathy for terrorism needs to be punished again .
video surveillance aims to improve ce@@ ase@@ fire so that it is especially difficult to buy weapons on the Internet .
&quot; the last , much discussed sec@@ rec@@ y of sec@@ rec@@ y for physicians is to be maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères words . &quot;
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession he wants to look for solutions on how to reduce the danger of citizens , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the ra@@ dic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers better social care necessary . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for cop@@ ing with trau@@ mati@@ zed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of cover@@ t investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the SPD chief Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
it is important that the interior minister spoke clearly against action .
&quot; that was a sla@@ p for the sni@@ pers in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union following a ban and the abolition of the double nationality .
&quot; a general prohibition of full veil , it considers problematic to be constitu@@ tionally problematic . &quot;
&quot; one cannot ban everything that is borrow@@ ed , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
it is possible to talk about rules in road traffic or for witnesses to court .
green editor Sim@@ one Peter proposed to the minister he wanted to simulate with ever @-@ new anti @-@ terrorist act and ability to act .
&quot; left @-@ wing leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet of pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people no more security in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow on the motorway
it st@@ akes regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the legal remedy is to be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all drivers who are in traffic on the ambient road every evening in traffic jams , when driving over the highway to Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
road construction will be extended next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer Street and the Wes@@ eler Straße in the right turn signal lane by 700 meters .
drivers can then thread directly from the Hammer Street on the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic is divided in a timely manner , thus improving the overall feel of the cycle on the busy section of the Bundes@@ straße 51 . &quot;
the idea with the extended exit was the CD@@ U faction in the district of Mu@@ en@@ ster @-@ West .
&quot; the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder makes drivers nervous , especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stage reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ gh@@ her way and sometimes beyond . &quot;
the reason is the needle eye on the B 51 just before the exit Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , the traffic is guided only one lane on the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built back in a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer possesses the required load @-@ bearing capacity , in order to record the heavy @-@ load traffic two @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bott@@ len@@ eck and the related week@@ long traffic will last , the competent regional company will not be able to say . &quot;
&quot; however , it has to be reck@@ oned with years : the bridge has an official remaining service life up to the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal abor@@ tion period , the state @-@ owned company deliberately chose the bu@@ oy@@ ant time during the school holidays , because it is to be expected with disabilities . &quot;
traffic will be tra@@ cked on the construction site on Tuesday and Wednesday .
intercultural Travel : cultural Activities for Schools
the international class of Wald@@ schule visited the play &quot; The invisible house . &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Young Theatre are now planning a music project .
the N@@ ima &apos;s Association enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule children &apos;s house has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; &quot; of the Youth Theatre of Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; 19 students from eleven to fifteen years visited the staging in the Small House . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims at the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , offers schools with welcome classes the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster through this project . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people in the class came to Mu@@ en@@ ster between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action , according to the press release of the Youth Theater in Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tan@@ na@@ z West@@ er@@ berg from spra@@ kel , and the Young Theatre will work together in the coming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , young people with and without escape and migration background will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
activities for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning phase .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Travel &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association counts with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has made the shooting stars in the south @-@ west of Germany on the night for Friday a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the shooting stars are Per@@ sei@@ ds , which with 2@@ 16@@ 000 km per hour belong to the fastest shooting stars . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , you roll around forever , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning you can no longer think of sleep well before the alarm bells . &quot;
this is all but relaxing .
&quot; after all , one is in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as non @-@ restor@@ ative . &quot;
how do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many causes for them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for S@@ leep Therapy and Sle@@ eping Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one understands pro@@ vision@@ ally , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , an in- and sleep disorder . &quot;
&quot; the sleeping feels many people as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German Medical Association , with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony . &quot;
what &apos;s behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; behind this , organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medication . &quot;
&quot; in@@ frequently , sleep disorder is an expression of another disease . &quot;
&quot; very early awakening is most common in a depression , &quot; she says . &quot;
and it can be that different factors require one another .
&quot; for example , who has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and worries , there is an example . &quot;
this leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible .
when should sleep problems become a doctor ?
anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor .
&quot; the impairment can look quite different : you are beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or headache . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep problems , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include , among other things , behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy , or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any lowered sleep medicine in Germany , emphasizes Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary S@@ leep Medicine Centre of the Char@@ ité University Medicine Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of sleep problems one should first turn to the family doctor , advised We@@ eß . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied by examining whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what will happen ? &quot;
&quot; for example , in the sleep laboratory , doctors recommend snor@@ ing with breathing agents , in case of fatigue , for sleep@@ wal@@ kers , or if you don &apos;t find the cause of a sleeping disorder , &quot; explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
you don &apos;t have to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only do not make a nap , &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
after dressing you go to bed at his normal time .
&quot; in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera at the ceiling shows the sleeping person . &quot;
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a number of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep .
&quot; we@@ aving counts on : regular sleep and stop times , do not lie too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , don &apos;t watch TV for falling asleep , avoid alcoholic drinks and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that &apos;s not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp has to do with missing med@@ als in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ assem@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for dis@@ appo@@ inting results from the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he first picked gold at the short @-@ track world championships in Doh@@ a , while at the same time set up his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now the former DS@@ V athlete , Markus Dei@@ nier , has put himself in front of his ex @-@ team @-@ mates standing in front of his critics . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion receives 20,000 € and a jungle king 150@@ ,000 € , nobody should be surprised about missing med@@ als , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; the conveyor system in swimming sport is bad , whereas dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
this means that we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not look so closely at the topic of dop@@ ing or even operate it .
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , he would have to be reported nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; those who cannot be controlled for a certain time before the World Cup / OS by independent controllers of the WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not participate , &quot; says the election ham@@ burger , who now operates an ice cream . &quot;
airport : prisoner gang arrested
professional thi@@ eves at the airport Düsseldorf
&quot; on Thursday , the police pursued the arrest of two women and two men aged 50 to 61 . &quot;
the suspect also had several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and baggage @-@ ste@@ els .
&quot; at 9.@@ 30@@ pm , civil servants in the area of Düsseldorf recognized a band that was known to polic@@ emen from past theft off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; since mid @-@ July this year , the two women and two men had committed multiple crimes and were involved in a joint , working and especially professional manner . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Criminal Com@@ miss@@ ariat 34 can demonstrate four acts for the thi@@ eves , which had been specifically travelled to Germany to commit crimes . &quot;
&quot; they captured a total of more than 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , a couple of lime bro@@ o@@ ks , in between still a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stones : the Riga Street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not affect the first sight , but the police force them to the &quot; dangerous places &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a freshly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
someone &quot; ugly ! &quot; spra@@ yed on the facade of a grey house .
&quot; in front of a Li@@ dl , which will soon be demol@@ ished , it is already being built : until 2017 , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here . &quot;
&quot; article about this &quot; &quot; trendy neighbourhood &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is , however , preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have rented contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin interior sen@@ ator Henkel has repeatedly called for a hard action by the police against the project , the area known as the &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; after three weeks of official statements ti@@ died on the ground floor , the Kad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , the police pat@@ ro@@ bed official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team wag@@ ons on site , locked sections of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners , the building workers were renov@@ ating the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal and a day later police and construction workers retired under the che@@ ering of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others are talking about late night . &quot;
there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the immediate vicinity of the house projects .
&quot; left violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and J@@ ana * , who is attracting three children , are especially anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z who wanted mostly police protection from the v@@ and@@ alizing left .
&quot; the Gra@@ ben , the Berlin sen@@ ator and the police between the occup@@ iers and their neighbors , apparently does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in , East of Berlin , was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which today has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , among them almost the entire Main@@ zer Straße close to the Rig@@ a@@ er . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under large police orders in a real street battle , many of the projects in the Rig@@ a@@ er were leg@@ alized and partly inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and bal@@ u@@ stra@@ des from all over the world : residents from East Germany and former home occup@@ iers are now sharing their neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; this is also noticeable in the r@@ ents , which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in new lease companies . &quot;
&quot; many of the new buildings in the Rig@@ a@@ er are attacked as symbols for this development : they can be seen on win@@ ed pan@@ es or freshly painted faç@@ ades , which were dis@@ car@@ ded with paint bags . &quot;
no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; lef@@ tist violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime : crimes such as body damage are , according to statistics , almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the criminal off@@ ences are made of material damages , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer who has lived in a rented house for 17 years next to the controversial 94 , there can be no question of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for acts of violence , it is appe@@ asing : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they were certainly not . &quot;
even the famous burning cars no longer give it to the Rig@@ a@@ er anymore .
&quot; for the studied architecture , her street is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here , one helps each other , lives along the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer was consciously drawn to the Rig@@ a@@ er Straße - and stayed .
&quot; that &apos;s why it was so important for her that the residents get their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly claimed the significance of the district . &quot;
&quot; but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the street will continue to be taken away from them : through fac@@ eless new buildings in former building spaces that the old inhabitants supp@@ ress . &quot;
&quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well drunk here live here , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I am absolutely not able to endor@@ se violence and destruction . &quot;
but what should we do if someone never stops ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , even with the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who are angry about color bombs : the house projects and the left @-@ hand scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; those who draw , should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub , can complain badly about noise . &quot;
all persons presented with first names have asked not to be called by their correct name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is new refugee
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on the spot .
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been refugee officer for Ur@@ bach since July .
the social pedago@@ gue supports the team of the administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact for all actors : refugees , working group Refu@@ gee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else involved . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there ; the ice @-@ reli@@ eving pleasure mil@@ k@@ sau that has above all a problem .
&quot; in this way , some - less ridi@@ cul@@ ously as much more targeted than the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job . &quot;
&quot; an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people was sought , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , just an ice @-@ reli@@ ant wool @-@ mil@@ k@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not their central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has a 50 percent position for three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and minor problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
&quot; soon , new containers are standing in the washing street &quot;
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized .
the local authorities are responsible for the connection provision .
you will have to accommodate the refugees in your own or rented living rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the coun@@ cill@@ or to the municipality and the job center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every owner wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it doesn &apos;t work , you need to rely on private apartments , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common dwell@@ ings must be reinforced as it is called so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but it is not only with apartments .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a fixed stay , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and assistance to refugees and migrants who need to be har@@ med or furnished . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer reports . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home@@ owners , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will result in a positive external action .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and above all language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , here too , administration and honorary official jump . &quot;
it is essential that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the proceedings is a problem .
&quot; they must explain the refugees that it just takes and they can make sense of time , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point develop the feeling that he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , can &apos;t work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be able to integrate himself . &quot;
the clear majority was motivated .
&quot; but there are also problems , says the customer honestly , &quot; people with whom nothing goes . &quot; therefore , the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer is always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
&quot; all this is already a &quot; &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : after the recent occur@@ ren@@ ces , do the two have fear of ra@@ dic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer says quite clearly &quot; what a certain nai@@ ve might call . &quot; a residual risk could and would not exclude it . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would be afraid that the assass@@ ins will complete them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; Reg@@ ine says . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region .
they have always been in the background that soon a new impetus for refugees and migrants could come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics ab@@ h@@ ors itself . &quot;
&quot; actually , it is unfair to put them on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach we haven &apos;t arrived where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot;
Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer also makes it clear that the Ur@@ bach has already been utilized to sensi@@ bly integrate the previous people .
&quot; currently , these are about 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : search for bur@@ gl@@ ars with helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew off different areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
&quot; on Friday morning , two unknown men were forci@@ bly penet@@ rated into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house in the Lin@@ den@@ weg . &quot;
&quot; the residents surprised the two , and struck the garbage in the flight . &quot;
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , well mas@@ ked , both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies wore . &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
&quot; as a reminder , the police deployed several stripes and a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag was without success .
&quot; eventually , the unknow@@ ns fell in close proximity to the apartment or on their escape . &quot;
