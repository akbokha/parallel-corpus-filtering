<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues looked for a bit of variety with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden World Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted home in the fast gallop home to feed comfort."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," "says Langer."</seg>
<seg id="9">"and with that, the equestrian career ended up again."</seg>
<seg id="10">On Saturday Germany's best golfer of all time - 101 tournament victories - again near horses.</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let his family run through the complex of the ALRV, on a horse he did not even swear to photographic purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"long was the first time in Aachen, and thus also at the CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German Sports Aid was handed over to the man from Anhausen in the frame of a small gala the Golden Age pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of honours for the sympathetic athlete.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silberner laurel leaf, Champions-Tour-Player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the Queen of England has already rebuked him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first prize winner Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," Langer says, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting young talents."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US-Masterswinner was shot at the" Hall of Fame of German Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the founder of Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Rudder Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumping rider Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sports legends came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company immigrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza-price was running."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trumpets Economic Policy Compared: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - both Clinton and Trump.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are at odds with the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are underlying a fundamental, rather philosophical difference."</seg>
<seg id="5">On the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"Trump wants to keep those in doubt rather small, and warns against how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively retire from regulations, and he is making himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says:" the state has certain tasks to fulfil, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why taxes for the rich would increase, they say."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic of infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"to be invested in the future, Trump and Clinton say almost word-like."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic politics and are strictly opposed by the Republican Party's Teachy wing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"so, on Trump there could still be party discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power stations and drive up coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in areas protected so far, and intends to cancel the Parisian Climate Protection Agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to explicitly expand the renewable energies with its investment programme and demands:" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">But not only in infrastructure - even in international trade agreements the two competitors are not too far apart from each other.</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the Transspazied trade agreement, do not want to sign both."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, the US does not want to isolate the US from international trade but simply to better protect American jobs."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they are to be paid better, too, calls for Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The present minimum wage of $7.25 is a wage of hunger.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage must rise, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months would probably be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics keep him ahead, so the budget deficit would only be greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, who wants at least from the rich, wants to pay more taxes and whose critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experiences with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">Sexual violence is almost a part of everyday life for women who are fleeing themselves alone.</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">There are four women sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each of them has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has laid her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looks curiously in the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares on the table-top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is observed.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles briefly and kisses the little one.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the Executive Director of Condrobs, a sponsor for social welfare services in Bavaria, and is concerned among other things with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are fowl.</seg>
<seg id="16">"they live in the north of Munich, one of the few decentralised dwellings for single-winged women and their children in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs opened up the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich women's assistant."</seg>
<seg id="18">It has recently been officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - even not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight," Bahr states. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them as hope carriers to Europe," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"women outweigh other reasons for the run:" many steal away secretly, because they see no other way out. "</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have had experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honours, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">"on the run, this goes on."</seg>
<seg id="28">"for example, tugs for a bottle of water challenge a sexual act is not a rarity," Bahr states. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"whoever believes that as soon as they arrive in Germany, Bahr relates."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and abused in the worst case."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this results in the fact that about 90 percent of women living in the accommodation in the Munich north are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are accustomed to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about what has been experienced, because shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as she often doesn't know how to help, more accommodations only need for her, requires Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">In Bavaria the seven district governments are responsible for the accommodation of refugees.</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich, some say with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in the housing of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabia, fleeing women are not accommodated separately," says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government. "</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia, there are stories in some community shelters or own homes for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, where there are two central lodgings exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">Also the committee "Women's Rights and Gender Equality" in the European Parliament calls for women to be accommodated separately from men.</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important for men and women to be accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is lacking or will men and women live together, there can be - perpetuating - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need for protection can be read on the rush, which there is on the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been around for us, we have a long waiting list," Bahr states. "</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily open a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant physicians have called on their union to approve new work combat measures in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) demanded more work combat measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC testified that ministers had failed to respond to the concerns of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance specialists and medical students voted on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members who voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who was published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government had" persistently calm "problems, leading to the rejection of the Treaty."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "In consideration of this, the JDC Executive Board has agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and call for official re-negotiations to all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC Executive Board today submitted a formal request to a special meeting of the BMA Council in order to approve a running programme of escalating work combat measures which commenced at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in addition, the dispute led that resident doctors strike six times this year, the first total failures in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">"the head of the BMA Registrar, Dr. Johann Malawana, resigned after the election to reject the agreed terms and conditions recommended by the BMA."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to surrender their hands, announcing an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin is receiving his Turkish opponent in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg Palace, I can't deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation the most."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed narrower, and he had little warmth, even for his restrained circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, spoke about his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report a whole five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to its old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper reported that Erdogan had behaved as if nothing bad had happened."</seg>
<seg id="11">"to me, his enthusiasm seemed to be rather the opposite."</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiating, sustainable coolness showed that Russia's head of state had not forgotten anything."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to that time was blasted.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin denounced and blamed Ankara to fall back on Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The decline was even greater as it was done by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the cousins will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state-controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">Suddenly it seemed as if the Turks would bear the blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">The accusations from senior officials were the most serious that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trading in the areas of Syria controlled by the so-called Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St.Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forwards."</seg>
<seg id="24">"after all, this meeting took place only because Putin had received the excuse from President Erdogan to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">Erdogan primarily needs all the friends he can get after he was relieved of almost his office during a failed coup d'etat.</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorism attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the ban on charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast every year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late-season onslaught on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television forecast cheaper fruits and vegetables as soon as Turkish agricultural imports are allowed to be restored."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vechtsti put it as follows:" tourists there long, tomatoes here long. "</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">Ankara is furious to the West because its reaction to the attempted takeover of power is considered a weak answer.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the persistent resentment on the snail's pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is keen to benefit from the cool atmosphere and reduce Turkey's relationship with the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">The Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara that he demanded support for the elected state organs after the attempted coup d "état.</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course that has a deep fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea made it possible for Russia and Turkey to present an" "alliance of outsiders" "as an analyst once described: two countries that are violating the West and feeling ill treated and are now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played a role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of first talks both presidents met at the press conference, that they didn't even grasp the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the president of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question of their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a complete disaster - when NATO member Turkey fired up the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two Heads of State, at least, talk to each other again."</seg>

<seg id="16">"now I say that we do not pursue global goals, but local objectives."</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work among these brands with the customers.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already said that it will not continue its Six Nations Sponsoring and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in his sports sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it is time for us to develop to the Bank of the brands, for how do we concentrate on the inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for clients?" "said the head of the board."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in 1972 in Tallinn's Estonian capital, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow International Relations Institute (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it is said (in Russian) that he later was the Chief of Staff and Chief of Staff of the government."</seg>
<seg id="10">He said to Putin about his appointment: "thank you for your trust."</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state regarding bills of bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin told the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince you?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow more mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov, for a long time, was one of the closest familiar Vladimir Putin and works as he for the Soviet secret service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin broadcast on television, both men asserted that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the result of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official assertion that a man who once was praised as a potential president, once again wanted to lead Russian environmental policy, met with great skepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks on Putin, which are quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said:" "it is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, to trust me this very complicated post - one could almost say - complaining posts for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"previously, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was the president of the Federal Security Service (FSB) who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted the most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it was once believed that after Putin's second term, Ivanov could become President of Russia, as a third term of Putin would have violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>
<seg id="31">Putin became prime minister before he became president three and a half years later.</seg>

<seg id="2">"the £1,35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017"</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers connected the north deck of the Queensland crossings with the viaduct - meaning that the bridge is now connected to Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "cover blowers", "approaching each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 oblique ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project is scheduled to be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister of Economy Keith Brown paid a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," This is a historic and symbolic moment when building the Queensland crossings. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all the witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a delicate activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for the fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"overall, almost 79% of the bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck is now available in Rosyth for the deck, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" "the first shutter is a significant milestone in every bridge project."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in this fantastic project, the closure is a trend-setting high and deep construction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the North Tower, we had to close the existing gap on the north or the side of the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive, because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6,000 tons and has to be pulled upwards at an incline of approx. 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"because the tolerances, on which the team works, were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds affordable housing in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">"the SPD and the Greens mean: in the future, investors should be taken much more seriously."</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 affordable housing in the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the next meeting of the council, the SPD is proposing a" "Home for Action". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"said S & D Group president Christoph Bratmann:" "we agree with the Greens: those who want to build on urban areas must pay 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the cheap apartments can, however, also arise in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big issue in the town hall is, says Bratmann:" how do you deal with investors looking to build on private surfaces? "</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such sites, but as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">A new urban housing development programme that costs millions of costs and is still to be funded should provide incentives.</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, so Bratmann:" there is currently no agreement between the factions. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few rules as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"regardless of what Bratwurst is concerned, there is a sharpening of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the action plan is implemented, this will ensure additional tasks in the building management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the program is still not entirely up-to-date: the 1260 new apartments, which were to be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you compensate for the loss of further about 1300 low-priced apartments, whose promotion will expire in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in order to prevent this, according to the spokesperson Nicole Palm, planning policy should now be purchased from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, we would have to think about bringing apartments back into the price bandaging."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at one stroke, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the end of the year, Friend dates back to the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="28">"around 1800 apartments, one could get there back into the price binding for cheap apartments."</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing associations."</seg>
<seg id="30">"as the number of social housing in the West City is dramatically increased again, the aim of the so-called" "pass-through" "is to be removed."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should not be a concentration of socially disadvantaged in just a few districts.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens are counting on the fact that there will still be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"s & D Group president, Holger Herlitschke, believes:" "for a broad majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world is changing.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenagers and children no longer go outside to play, but rather spend their free time staring on screens, was complained by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">"at Pokemon Go, it's about getting people from the sofa and getting more active."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was on TV initially, then limited to video games and recently on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities are not mutually exclusive."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the release of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand fell slightly in the beginning of July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon which can be tracked with a GPS and once they have been found" photographed "(via a screenshot on the mobile) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game, when she was younger, joined the tram and jumped for the search from the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the United States, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person returns every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, tracking 35.000 users, notified the Washington Post recently that within two days after the launch of the game, the number of followed people who exercise every day 30 minutes, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns on the health that people want to take" "30 minutes of time", "" "coming from the sofa" "and" "active every day" "met deaf ears because many public messages are boring for health and coming from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"however, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">"those who regularly exercise sports, reduce their chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to lead them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonderful thing about Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something in the open that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"three pillars of health are thus covered - movement, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are gruesome game perks that have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What's it like?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough is happening.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps like Fitbit were able to track our activity earlier, they didn't give us any reason to do sports as this game does."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be diminished with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to poker success, there will be more games that will combine apps and virtual reality with activism in the real world, helping many people on the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="10">"on Thursday, the 19-year-old American gymnast stepped on to the competition title and extended the gap between himself and the rest of the world under the spotlight of the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="11">Their overall result of 62.198 was clearly before the silver medalists and "Final Five" team mate Aly Raisman and the Russian bronze medal winner Aliya Mustafina.</seg>
<seg id="12">"the American women Simone Biles turnes on the suspended beam during the single-multi-campaign women in gymnastics at the Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro 2016, Brazil, Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American who wins a multi-competition title and, in total, the fifth, while she consolidates her reputation to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears when her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">This success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps who brought their sports to new heights:</seg>
<seg id="16">"Biles has dominated the sports art of the last three years, 15 World Cup medals - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic Champion of 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said she's" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"she expected a final exam in Brazil, a competition not so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>
<seg id="18">Not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring Texas would be considered a disappointment.</seg>

<seg id="22">Part of their ground exercises - which contain their typical Tumbling Pass - is attuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio.</seg>
<seg id="23">This is no coincidence.</seg>

<seg id="25">"since the summer of 2013, it has not lost a competition competition, a series of victories that will continue as long as it wishes."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even if Mustafina led easily through two turns, the picture was murmured."</seg>
<seg id="27">Floating beams and soil-urns - in which Biles holds the world title - lauded.</seg>
<seg id="28">"she recovered again with 15,433 on the suspended beam - and sat on the ground with a 15,933 on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="29">"Raisman hugged her gently as she expected her dervying - a mere formality - and tears streamed on Biles brilliantly red, white and blue eyeliner, as the vision she once described in her book-book became reality."</seg>
<seg id="30">"the performance of Raismans was a revenge for the last time four years ago, when she fought for the third place, but the bronze medal in a Tiebrake went to Mustafina."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this time, the 22-year-old team captain, who is called" "Oma" "by the Americans, had a lead."</seg>
<seg id="32">"after her practice, she cast down kisses to the audience, overwhelmed by a comeback, which sometimes seemed doubtful."</seg>

<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>
<seg id="4">The perpetrator fired eight shots from a handfirearm while standing on the passenger side of the car and subsequently escaped with another vehicle to read in the report.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the police said that the triple murder didn't seem to have been the result of a robbery, because the aggressor did not take the handbags or the $2,900, which were owned by one of the adult victims."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the police spokesperson, Phoenix Sgt. Jonathan Howard, said that the shooting was tempting investigators to take a closer look at whether they were connected to four previous attacks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in total, seven people were killed in nine attacks in Hispanic dwellings within four months and two more were injured."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it is happening in a residential area in front of a house," said Howard the KHPO, a subsidiary of CBS, at the beginning of the month. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"it is assumed that the suspects used several vehicles, including a brown Nissans from the late 1990s, a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadillac or Lincoln."</seg>
<seg id="10">Investigators refused to expose the evidence they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and were committed by the same murderer.</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the Women's Olympics in the Turns and that is for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been with every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and secondly: this team has three turner, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who had inspired many young girls of other skin colors."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jewess is and Madison Kocian, which is catholic, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team is finally echoing the US.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among the female gymnast was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year were Simone and Gabby # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">That shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a startling Olympic winner and America rejoiced."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible achievement of the triple world championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterful gyms routinely."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday Simone became the fourth, heterosexual American woman who won gold at an individual competition event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we are experiencing the peak of this sport, but so do classes in the whole country do not look like."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie fought all the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five" "because the next Olympic team will only have four gymnasts in the team. besides, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"however, the reality is that gymnastics are an expensive sport and turner primarily in private gymnasiums that can be maintained by parents who pay for training, training, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these clubs are located in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts get their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment for families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, trained both of her athletes since they started gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the municipalities aun countless young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy-to-access sports training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnastics foundation for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we offered free and affordable gymnastic in Harlem for over 15,000 urban youngsters (especially black and hispanic) and trains national and international winners."</seg>

<seg id="1">Political Correctness Culture Affects election fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">Former Mayor of Tower Hamlets Luton Rahman was removed last year for the release of a government report for corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to widespread ignored electoral fraud in Muslim communities as a devastating government report today.</seg>
<seg id="4">"former Cabinet member Sir Eric Pickles interferes with the police, election observers and Rathauts for ignoring evidence of electoral abuse due to" "hypersensitivity concerning ethnicity and religion". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former minister of integration and local government, who is now an antagonist king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barrier tapes outside electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">He recommends that voters should take an identification with themselves in order to prove their identity in elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter must only name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's finger, if they release their votes in order to prevent someone from choosing twice."</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblower should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to church documents and decisions from non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this is not only for election fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the broader corruption and financial fraud culture that goes along with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's electoral scandals in the east of London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special selection tribunal decided that the incumbent mayor of Luton Rahman should be relieved after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his office."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court found that Rahman would have" "perverted" "the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "in a cynical manner" "and that he would silence his critics with racism and Islamophobia."</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led "his campaign on the basis that it is the religious duty of Muslims to choose.</seg>
<seg id="16">"up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation, in which one person was chosen as someone else."</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there would be evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he voiced alarm on the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had put pressure on people to choose a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, mapped, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the leading of evidence to prove identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report, it says:" as proof has been indicated that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities was exercised, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the Elders, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi. "</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions had knowingly ignored such behaviour as a result of "politically correct" hypersensitivity in regard to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the prohibition of political activists to process letterbox documents in order to stop" picking. ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is being contemplated by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks in order to prevent the polling and social labelling system being used."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voter prior to choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Use non-removable ink on a person's finger once it has left its voice to prevent someone from choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">To carry out systematic reviews on the nationality of a person in order to ensure that they are eligible.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation on applications for an automatic choice of letters.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists are editing full letterings and envelopes of selections.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police have the authority to set up barriers to set up electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change in the law that facilitates an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the 1983 Representation of the People Act 1983.</seg>
<seg id="31">Prohibition of photography in electoral stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English may be used in the elective stations (with the exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go alone in the election cabin.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it" "amazing" "that after the Tower Hamlets case there was no criminal complaint."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the electoral commission has declared Lutsk Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty on a number of reasons - according to the high requirements in the criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "checkpoints" of the election registration departments of the Town Hall.</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Eric said:" "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal."</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud legacy as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the shoppers did not know where to look, when a woman pulled off her clothes in the middle of a Primark to try underpants."</seg>
<seg id="3">"to make the situation worse, she looked like she looked at it, pulled her off and put her back on the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="4">You continued to browse and tried four pairs of underpants in a shop at the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone.</seg>
<seg id="5">The Primark Business in the Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone where the woman tried the underpants before she put her back into the shelf</seg>
<seg id="6">"a mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who was in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried underwear she went back and left the shop without buying anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">"she said," "People could not believe what they saw."</seg>
<seg id="8">"standing in the middle of the sales area, she took a pair of underpants from the lining, pulled out her own pants and trousers and tried her."</seg>
<seg id="9">"she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"everyone stared when she pulled out the underpants that you obviously did not like, as she put them back on the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="11">"she repeated the same with three further underpants before she finally decided that she liked nothing, and went out and went out."</seg>
<seg id="12">"she did not seem to disturb that she was watching someone - or thinking about the person who, under certain circumstances, would buy the underpants that she had tried."</seg>

<seg id="14">The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Mrs. Davidson added:" "as I have received, the employees have tried to pull clothes out of sale after they went - which is just as good."</seg>
<seg id="16">I would hate to go home with a new pair of underpants and find out that another woman had her and pulled out and did not wash her.</seg>

<seg id="3">"we talked to Rhon Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you're approaching you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn the spear around for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you get closer to you from behind, then you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and get out of the gun line," Mizrachi says. "</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forelegs and shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then hit him with the knee in the bar and twist while the attacker bends before pain, the weapon in his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while holding the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"at attackers who approach the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the gun line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and beat the aggressor to the chest, then twist the gun out of his grip before moving backwards and directing the gun towards him."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright schabt for a guide his tongue at the dirtiest places of Europe</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveler undermined his immune system and worms in a serious test by leaking some of the dirtiest and disgusting places of Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk switched his train to a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing knob of a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before finishing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to get in."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to daylight."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of leaking the rinsing knob of a train toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey across Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and their own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad aftertaste in his mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright became known to test the resistance of his bowels by traveling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public money to train stations to flush lavatories of toilets, the task was definitely put to test by the immune system"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said:" already as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I put all sorts of things into my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he rejected was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His test line showed a luminometer count of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminometer rate of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet, which he refused to lick after their luminometer numbering over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands are of less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">Mr. Wright and Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film "The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" which shows the number of bacteria in different places as the bathroom</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film, he says:" "that comes close to the worst thing I've heard in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I will not lick here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We conducted crazy brainstorming that ended up saying "Let's Ian call us."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking only about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">Growing interest in intestinal health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" "let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian, if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him to lick, like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film."</seg>
<seg id="31">Of course there were things that made it easier for Ian to lick it and others where it was quite difficult.</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad that we recorded some of these dirty tricks on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all interviewed lactic acid bacteria associated with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 per cent said that they occasionally use products containing lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left their social home after a delogiation with a loss of £50,000 because they terrorized their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trechecock were thrown after a long list of complaints from her estate in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, the housing cooperative was shocked to find the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls showed gaping holes, wooden planks were torn, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that she is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house administration at Cornwall Housing, said that she was afraid that the apartment could no longer be repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think people don't have to live this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">"there are many things to consider, as this property is presumed to be considered not as beautiful as part of Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also known.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had joined, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking, and excessive screaming, strife and cursing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, got an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the property, where drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were torn"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbors said they saw them fighting on the streets and calling on the police regularly</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing shared her with her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended deadline of 11 weeks to voluntarily withdraw.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delegates were cheered by lightened neighbours who said their life was made hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They didn't care about anybody. "</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years alongside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to that!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now that they are gone, it will become beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager of Cornwall Housing, testified that it would have given the family to cooperate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, to which the police was called at regular intervals, 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the lessee agreed to accept any responsibility for their behavior and family, as delosion is always the last step to consider Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case as the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be terribly involved.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information we have provided."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and the message conveyed that antisocial behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left behind in one of the bedrooms of the house after the delogiation on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">House administration workers will now have to sweep away garbage mountains surrounding the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found more than 70g cannabis as well as balances, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">"skeldon received a fine, after she had pleaded guilty to the possession of a class B drug in commercial view."</seg>
<seg id="36">"she claimed that the money was for a gravestone of her son Lee Skeldon, who died in a car accident in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="37">"after they were homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the house walls of the house were graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">Police says that they will navigate renters who don't stick to the rules of the house</seg>
<seg id="40">"Angela Crow from the police of Devon and Cornwall said that the delosion is a clear warning to the other tenants, who do not stick to the house rules."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can act without self-reproach, and those who have been harmed by such a behaviour," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="4">"after a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic Village, Kenya has sent a coach home."</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee promptly agreed to establish a disciplinary commission to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">"a Kenyan functionary told that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, gave a urine sample in the Olympic Village under the name of the 800-meter-runner Ferguson Rotich."</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the Team Director Kenias of the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the IAAF world association has requested the IOC for information on the case in order to make their own investigations, an IAAF spokesman announced."</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the study and the following measures of the IOC, the IAAF will evaluate the assessment," stated the IAAF statement. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the Doping control station and released himself as Ferguson Rotich, sent and signed the test," explained Kenias's Head de Mission Stephan Arap Soi. "</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for training controls of the World Anti-Doping Agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Rotich had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="13">"four days earlier, the Kenyan Athletics Heads of Heads Michael Rotich had been deducted from the Rio Games."</seg>

<seg id="17">"at the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls laid out by the IOC in front of the Rio Games, it was unusual to point out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia will be targeted."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the World Anti-Doping Agency had exerted a great deal of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil, to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system."</seg>

<seg id="3">A surprising Cecilia Bartoli.</seg>
<seg id="4">"a musical conquers Salzburg: the West Side Story, Leornard Bernstein's masterpiece."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the artistic director, Cecilia Bartoli, wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and fulfilled herself with the role of Mary a youth dream."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the orchestra pit, the Simón Bolívar Orchester directed by the Venezuelan conductor Gustavo Dudamel:" "this music is full of rhythm," "he enthuses."</seg>
<seg id="7">We always say that it is very Latin American.</seg>
<seg id="8">There are many Latin American ingredients at their tempo and melody.</seg>
<seg id="9">"it's a wonderful mixture, the perfect recipe for our orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="10">I would say that we really have Bernstein's music in our blood!</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this production, Bartoli plays an older Maria."</seg>
<seg id="12">She remembers her love with Tony while the younger Mary plays and dances.</seg>
<seg id="13">The role of Mary has always fascinated me.</seg>
<seg id="14">"first, because it is musically exceptional!"</seg>
<seg id="15">And then there would be Mary's personality.</seg>
<seg id="16">"she says in her song:" "I feel pretty, oh so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright."</seg>
<seg id="17">"so it is smart, of course also naïve, and very passionate."</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is very similar to me, my Italian character, which I have as a Roman," laughs Bartoli. "</seg>
<seg id="19">Dudamel is full of praise for the opera singer: "Cecilia is a wonderful artist.</seg>
<seg id="20">It is such an honour to work with her.</seg>
<seg id="21">It is a tremendously generous person.</seg>
<seg id="22">And Bartoli adds the compliment: "Dudamel is such an exceptional artist and very passionate!"</seg>
<seg id="23">Conducting is a necessity for him.</seg>
<seg id="24">"you see it in each of his movements, in his looks, it's his life!"</seg>
<seg id="25">It is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we both have a rather southern temperament, a fire, a passion and a joyous approach to life, which is very important at all!"</seg>
<seg id="27">For American director Philip Wm. McKinley is the "West Side Story" up-to-date: "this piece deals with prejudice and fanaticism.</seg>
<seg id="28">"today we have the refugees, then the Puertories went to New York, and the New Yorkers did not want them."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kadiza Sultana, one of three British schoolgirls who left London last year to join the IS, reported reports in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that a few weeks ago, her family found out about her death in Raqqa, Syria."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it was suspected that she was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the Bollywood group in the country, ITV news reported on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Sultana was seventeen years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she had planned to leave the war-torn country and return to England."</seg>
<seg id="6">"one can only hope that the only good is in it - as warning and warning to others that these are the risks associated with it, to go to a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," "said Akunjee."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in February 2015, Sultana and two other school maids from the east of London entered a plane in direction to Turkey and then entered a bus to the Syrian border."</seg>

<seg id="2">"who doesn't fit and Erdogan praises, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-close Stiftung Dialog and Welt, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">The Kurdish community of Germany anticipates at short notice with tens of thousands of protection-seekers who flee from Turkey to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, there could even be" some hundred thousand "," believed the chairman of the federation Ali Toprak. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"following the coup attempt by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurdish community Germany is expecting a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with several hundred thousand refugees from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the president of the Union Ali Toprak of the "World" of Friday. "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had already outsourced Kurd strongholds before months, 500,000 Kurds were fleeing inside Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the frozen putsch, secular and oppositionist ethnic Turks were added."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to start anew in Europe if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that receives refugees, produces refugees in their own country," said Toprak. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the commander-in-chief complained about the targeted resettlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, Erdogan wants to increase the pressure on the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last big minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or expelled in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The Comintern called for the Federal Government to be "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany too, there is a witch-hunt against Erdogan critics."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in recent months, I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">"more Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionists."</seg>
<seg id="19">The branding of Gülen fans will annihilate the professional existence of teachers and other academics.</seg>
<seg id="20">"anyone who doesn't fit and Erdogan praises, sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and seculars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-close Stiftung Dialog and Education, the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as the paper is referred to by calling on numbers from the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Turks set out before the coup the largest group of asylum entitled asylum in Germany, recognised because of political persecution."</seg>
<seg id="22">"at the reporting date June 30, this would have been 11.386 people and thus almost 29 per cent of all recognised as the right-wing certifications (39.625)."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the natives do not get anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to vote for the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for more stupid than up to now it's not possible: summer holidays, heat and day-to-day elections - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">The locals that are to be convinced by the campaigners are on holiday.</seg>
<seg id="7">"most travelers who are travelling in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not a local, so you may not vote for the holiday."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: helpers who hang out posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers, and count out voices at the end, only laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the electoral and last day of the holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern once again has to pass an election campaign over the people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in polls."</seg>
<seg id="13">It is exciting to see how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and head of government since 2008, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, distributes roses and impedes a little with the people, just as his legendary precarious predecessor Harald Ringstorff did."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, seafering has got cold feet and gives chancellor Merkel blame on the flowering of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"her refugee policy, her" "We created this," "accelerated the rise of the right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful office."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is, if at the wrong time, at the right place, election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited German chancellor Angela Merkel to major documents; Merkel parliamentary election district is in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority from other federal states," "accused Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, recently in NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad for anyone from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">"apart from that, the north-east CDU largely waives the usual election booths on market places and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"this, coking, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union also noted that in the country, you have to crumble the base, that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it's like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any available in the expanses of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the advice of the CDU campaigner Kokert to his fellow campaigners is also self-revealing:" "they must go where it hurts, namely where people are: village festivals, golden weddings, any birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because there is much on the game, Sellering has called his SPD to a very committed election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in polls, the Socialists and Democrats last with 22 percent behind partners CDU (25) and just ahead of the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in the election of 2011, the SPD was still able to win 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, the small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the Parliament day."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of the holiday-need and largely lay out their election campaign on the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," calls the president of the country Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"apart from that, green elective fighters embark on a search for traces of local vocal cords among holidaymakers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top candidate, curved straight with a houseboat through the lakes of Mecklenburg."</seg>
<seg id="36">Your impression: "electoral holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment."</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 restoration: inns suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 in the morning and end only at about 8pm, there are all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they made everything quite shaky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no default.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site could be moved to the south at half-time at the beginning of the week, and everything will be ready by the end of October."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the award is also vowed to those responsible for the construction work, for instance when it comes to setting up residence trips."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site was moved to the south on Monday and the closure of the asphalt road in Ofterdingen has been lifted and therefore the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the site is relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">Passing through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in some cases, there were considerable complaints," says the deputy head office manager Florian King responsible for the traffic management of the refurbishment. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachlerstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many creeping paths were looking for and more familiar to their Navi than the signs."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to some trucks being franchised in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not adhered to, the municipality also called for Mössingen vehicle."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were significant overrides," "says King, who made himself informed about the situation himself."</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been heated.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the road at 77 km / h in the Tempo-30-zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has been extended, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the street is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, the fact that the B 27 renovation has led to burglary revenues, allows everyone to look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the" end customer "are produced for other companies, for which the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"also at the dealership Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "most slight decline", "but also admits that of course" the drive is missing. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the locals along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly a crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential threat.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants have" hit hard. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil were missing."</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be glad about every Euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the revenue losses were" "far more than 50 percent." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">Street restoration took place "two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to release half of his employees.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half had been dismissed, the policy would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, with the hint that the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation on the B 27. now it must also bear the disadvantages resulting from the rehabilitation."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows about other land circles where so much more funding was handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is sure his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, pointing to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">It can be understood that other regulars are now less frequently passing by because of the complicated traffic management.</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive, it's also somewhere else beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="42">"after the restoration work has ended, Göhner has no doubts."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner sees the impact of the B 27 construction work on its clientele for the largest crisis that has experienced its restaurant in its long-standing history."</seg>
<seg id="44">"six months of construction work, it's brutal."</seg>

<seg id="1">Laws are constantly being screwed on in the name of the fight against terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="2">"according to recent attacks, Interior Minister de Maizière is now presenting a thick security package."</seg>
<seg id="3">But what does a tolerance status have to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the verse.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals are politically unacceptable to the coalition partner," said the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package. "</seg>
<seg id="7">They do not overwhelm anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">Other further points would initially be discussed within the parties.</seg>
<seg id="9">I also took part in this.</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, as Minister of the Interior, he was well-positioned and at a" "realisable consensus" "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière took a little time before presenting his conclusions on safety in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But they are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"some of them have already been announced, announced, filed: a new security authority to deal with the crack of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">Nor is it the fact that Germany has to implement several EU directives on air passenger data and weapons law.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière entered a second trial for proposals that had not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to raise sympathies for terrorist groups and knock jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this will be difficult points for the SPD," says the CDU man. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, he considers this to be reasonable and also requires nothing, which in the case of coalitionpartner does not have any chance anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas are presented by de Maizière as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">"they have, in part, in themselves: he plans fast procedures for deportations and more possibilities for the incarceration of people before deportation."</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted in the country are to check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a security check.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the case of Dulces for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than until now - such as those who commit crimes or deliberately throw away their documents in order to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of it is politically and legally justifiable.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them are still unexploded and leave questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">And in some points - in the case of imunequal treatment of patient - for example - the question arises: what does it actually have to do with security and terror?</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the issues refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the attacks of Ansbach and Würzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people worried about security in the face of high refugee figures."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that deeply dealt with the people, did not allow themselves to be clinging up in election battle times."</seg>
<seg id="30">The focus is on inner security.</seg>
<seg id="31">"first stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are political fights."</seg>
<seg id="35">"for this reason, the Union and the SPD are increasingly taking a stand on the issue of internal security."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, there was a high level between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a secret dispute over the equipment of the Federal Police, then a security policy idea collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the departments also demand a Burka ban and a return from the dual citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also struggling here for conciliatory sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">"from a return from the double pass, he keeps nothing."</seg>
<seg id="40">We have satisfied the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To replenish it is not reasonable.</seg>
<seg id="42">"and in case of a Burka ban, he has constitutional concerns."</seg>
<seg id="43">"whether its own package is constitutionally stable at all corners and whether it is actually" reasonable "for the coalitionpartner, has yet to be demonstrated."</seg>
<seg id="44">There's a lot of things in it that could cause strife.</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also trying to gain a foothold in the issue of internal security.</seg>

<seg id="6">"despite its many brands and some well-running markets, Europe's largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus in the course of the year due to its many brands and some well-running markets."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in July, VW's core brand weakens mainly in Western Europe and thereby again burdened the overall sales, as the company listed in the Dax."</seg>

<seg id="9">"sales in Western Europe alone, the second most important market in China, accounted for 14 percent below the previous year's quarter."</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the home market of Germany, deliveries dropped by almost one sixth."</seg>
<seg id="11">Sales of sales Jürgen Stackmann led the weaker figures from July especially to two sales days less in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, there was a purchase restraint in some core markets due to" changed economic conditions. ""</seg>

<seg id="14">"in the US, where the exhaust-gas atmosphere first escalated, there is also a minus for beech."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Chinese market is a great support for VW.</seg>
<seg id="16">"all in all, the primarily affected domestic brand of the Lower Saxony is already worse due to the diesel scandal: after the first seven months, only a distribution minus of 0.9 percent to 3.37 million vehicles is reported."</seg>
<seg id="17">Group sales manager Fred Kappler was able to proceed from January to July onwards.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles at this time, 5.904 million worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="19">Volkswagen had been manipulated with a software exhaust system.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in Germany alone, VW is calling some 2.5 million cars to refit into the workshops."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the course of retrofitting, VW confirmed that the conversion of the cars has no negative effects."</seg>
<seg id="22">"after retrofitting the vehicles, there is no deterioration in fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the car manufacturer claims a" guaranteed "certificate for the customer after the retrofitting, but I do not speak of a" guarantee "as stated on Friday in company circles."</seg>
<seg id="24">The reasons are legal refinements.</seg>
<seg id="25">The "Focus" had reported that Volkswagen now guarantees its German customers a guarantee of upgraded diesel models.</seg>
<seg id="26">"last Monday, this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport."</seg>
<seg id="27">The Ministry of Transport has confirmed that there was a meeting.</seg>
<seg id="28">"VW is fully compliant with the requirements of my Commission of Inquiry, and KBA."</seg>
<seg id="29">"divergences are not accepted," said Minister of Transport Alexander Dobrindt (CSU) according to the ministry. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"VW has taken over the guarantee that in terms of fuel consumption, CO2 emissions or engine performance after retrofitting, there are no deterioration and all vehicle-approved vehicle values remain unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="31">"Volkswagen himself does not use the term" "guarantee" "but not as it was said in company circles."</seg>
<seg id="32">"for example, the wide term" guarantee "gives Volkswagen the opportunity for customers to come into a workshop half a year after the changeover, for example - and this could result in the new software, even if the damage doesn't have anything to do with it."</seg>
<seg id="33">"also in the interest of customers, it is important to avoid any other damage that has nothing to do with the waste market, to ensure uncertainty about possible warranty regulations, as stated."</seg>
<seg id="34">Therefore VW does not use the term "warranty."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-old love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to the comment section, to hand it under the pseudonym non-Allegrássmen's middle-age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the much discussed revival of records does not result in a boom in millennials that want to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">There is also no hordes by hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older turntables rather retain their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But do the results of YouGov agree?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog is a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy street in Soho, wearing a modest grey suit and game wild before I stop, hold my hands and take a bit of anti-mood like:" well, let's take a closer look at it. "</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even though the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which once independent sellers were located - is still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to appreciate their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into the Reckless Records (Number of data: eight middle-aged men, a woman, probably around the 20), is a day long due to a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">Is he a collector I ask?</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I didn't follow him home), revet the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records, which he could not afford, when she appeared and again buying items he sold, when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70's, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things that I was probably a little too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records tend to be more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot. "</seg>
<seg id="21">That is my truck.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works with Sister Ray, also believes that many customers he meets can apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pub, people who have heard about the comeback and are forced to buy their old records again."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations I have led, people usually have gotten rid of their collection so much about 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to supporters of a certain age record revision.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the supposed emotional significance of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes just a few seconds in a shop like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a soothing community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers accepted the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from items that watch happy memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"we are like their social workers!" a staff of a record pile is fluttering.</seg>
<seg id="35">An ICM survey in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month had not yet listened to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player who they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record have no record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I make a smoother through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle-aged men) has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone came in just recently and said," I don't own a record player, but I would like to buy a Radiohead disc so I can put them on the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less music-quality."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," I don't have a record player. "</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones, who come in slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated almost a whole floor to the records, has a lower audience than I was going to."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around 70, tourists who take photos, teenage boys and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even though the atmosphere is slightly less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer and sextpacker pop instead of experimental jazz blends from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks odd, but serious psychological trauma is hard to imagine when you stand next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around for a number of minutes and looks at the variety of plates that are available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-shopping easier than a big shopping bag.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in another way, but the beauty of records is"... "it drives away with a dearded sigh."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I'm pretending to have the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teen girls group together for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter think about buying a crosstrainer turntable."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of panels by Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mix of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one looks at them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "plate art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items could mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as records."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even if my research showed that the results of YouGov agree, they, at least in record stores in Soho, let the large number of female collectors exist in reality, record stores and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people probably work hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bumblebees through plate shops of Berwick Street and the sheets by plates, while they avoid the starry view of an uncanny, 30-year-old wrong moderator who rises above the shoulders of middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court has rejected an offer by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary shops and restaurants in the Calais section in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be competent to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods, cigarettes, drinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">The prefecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down because they would represent a parallel economy out of which no taxes would be paid and which could hold a fire and sanity risk.</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported union and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary stores and restaurants would often provide accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses, but acknowledged that the concerns of the Calais prefecture are" absolutely comprehensible. ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much larger role than simply feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the low price was the Jungle Book Kids' Café at the camp, which is operated in a community and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as a consultation on asylum cases for hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people signed the petition to maintain the Kids' Café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that the closure was" for these children a catastrophe, of which the youngest eight years are old. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated on Friday that the number of people living in the jungle has risen to more than 9,000 people - the highest number up to now - after a steep increase in new arrivals in the course of the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Britain's impressive performance at the 7-year rugby came to an abrupt halt on Thursday evening at the last hurdle in the form of the Fijis, when they were struck by a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium in Rio."</seg>

<seg id="3">"from the first strokes to the last 220 hard Hieve that go into history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even if there were only those who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the coach Robin Williams, was present when they rowed for the second olympagold in a row without a helmswoman, the first women in the history of British sport who made such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolute, after all, their 39.1 unfired operation, which is also unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant athletes, who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the type of triumph to goose."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind each gold in the row is a battalion of willing helpers who make a difference to incremental advances that make the difference, and no one was more instrumental than the coach who didn't know whether he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he risky."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did that."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do so, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been quite a bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a little the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he was able to start treatment at the beginning of 2014, out of season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if this is the correct term in such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was in hospital and walked around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">Rowing in itself is already a challenge but that makes it even bigger.</seg>

<seg id="26">Helena Bell and Heather Stanning have not lost a race in the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not compete.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to close, Stanning and Glover had too much reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very trapped at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">Helen called "pale in the process; stay in the process."</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to get carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not looking forward to doing something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want fireworks today, we just wanted to achieve a good result, go out and win the race, what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - Lichtblick for the German Steel Industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">Financial burdens that threatened the sector from green electricity production are from the table.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the German steel industry, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the West German Allgemeine Zeitung, said that it remains at the release of the renewable energies situation in the German steel industry, said Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" West German Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really glad that we could finally arrive after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to this, the European Commission had initially planned to ask the steel producers to use gases from the blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel told the WAZ that there was now an agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissar Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">"only if the generators are replaced in the steel units, an EEG levy fall of 20 percent."</seg>
<seg id="10">But this too will not be raised in the steel industry either.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcome Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the previous regulation is largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">Gabriel's successful endeavor for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our 'steel' campaign, this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"also in the reform of emissions trading trade, climate and employment targets are to be weighed down," "explained IG Metall CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry in Europe suffers from overcapacity and substantial price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation continued to aggravate when the world's largest producer country China threw massive steel onto the world market in view of the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers throw in Chinese steel companies price dumping.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel have effects, on the other hand, economic prospects in China have accumulated."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainably the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, prices would have been rather stagnating."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at the same time, ThyssenKrupp decided not to exclude closure of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"around 86,000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers are cautious in spite of rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year, just as the German Steel Association announced on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the produced quantity went back to the second month in a row."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has risen by two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: sing good seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Ursel Kipp has accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, she took music in the school choir, and today the 78 year old sings in a seniors choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall more alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good with her health and mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors from several perspectives, says Erhard Hackler from the German Senior League."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of the music, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">"through regular gatherings, seniors can socialize and maintain social contacts."</seg>
<seg id="9">"often social and family structures dissolve in age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">Singing can be exhausting in the positive sense. Hackler says.</seg>
<seg id="12">"for this purpose, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"if you regularly require your lungs, you will not be able to get out of your everyday life as quickly as possible."</seg>
<seg id="14">Singing is an optimal hobby even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice in old age.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Working Group of the Seniors-Organisations."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, common singing had a much higher priority, it belonged to everyday life, both at school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people raises many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"due to song texts and especially melodies, even dementia sufferers learn about long-term events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head also requires a special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focusing on one's voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers - that's a big cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">Especially elderly people who live alone practice to concentrate not only on themselves.</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition, which one experiences through singing in the choir, Hackler says."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem is also growing by singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I practise for something long, I get better and grow beyond me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, so there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try a new hobby, don't hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - in 50 singing people, who will hear when there's a sound next to it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"looking for the right offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of friends in a senior choir, you can simply join them."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many towns also offer overviews over the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or the church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you do not have access to the Internet, please ask the family, friends or neighbors for help with the internet research."</seg>
<seg id="35">"those who desire to sing should necessarily join a choir, Hackler says."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does good for the soul and has something liberating - that applies to any age.</seg>

<seg id="4">She planned her home trip for the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">"whether from the further explosions on the holiday island Phuket as well as in the southern cities of Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chomphe are also Austrian citizens, it is still unclear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, says Schnöll."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Hua Hin, some 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, initially exploded two bombs on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to the police, a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured, among them the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Friday morning, two explosive charges went up again, and another human being was killed according to the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="10">Also from Phuket a bomb explosion was reported in the morning.</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the detonation near the popular beach of Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police instructions."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in Surat Thani, on the south-eastern coast of the country, another bomb exploded, killing an urban employee."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the authorities, the explosives had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the territorial police."</seg>
<seg id="14">"finally, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang were demanding on the south-west coast as well as in Chomphe on the south-east coast several wounded."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same handwriting," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning in front of journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume it is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express themselves about possible motives, but it is probably a matter of the actions of the Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to recognize a pattern that is typical for the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, stated that the attacks were not related to the Islamist rebellion or international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," "said a spokesman in Bangkok."</seg>
<seg id="22">"instead, one assumes that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta have been laid."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities would have received secret notes on upcoming attacks in the south of the country - though they were not informed about the exact date and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the police force their officials across the country to increase the security of major government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are always smaller bombings, but usually they do not turn against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace used for years by Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"according to the actual bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommended its homepage to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security (security level 3) was applied to the provinces Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhbroa, as well as Preah Vihear and its environs."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there will not be any necessary trips to these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution made by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military a great impact in the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"said Junta chief and prime minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs have been an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military unta, which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, will benefit itself to have brought the Kingdom back to stability and order."</seg>
<seg id="36">"however, the military did not manage to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in the conflict, more than 6500 people have already been killed."</seg>

<seg id="7">"it turns against" Multikulti-Wahn, "" uncontrolled mass immigration "and the" loss of one's identity by alienation. ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"constitutional protectors in nine states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - are already observing the" identities. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"Maisha said, his authority was closely aligned with the state offices when deciding on the decision."</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups like the 'identity movement' try to pick up their target group where it stands," "said the Chief of the Constitution."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in general, extremists try to address them with juvenile language, often with pop music."</seg>
<seg id="12">The faculties of Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is no concrete advertisement for one's own cause.</seg>
<seg id="14">The propaganda is meant to appeal to people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"last but not least, there have been reports of contacts of the" Identity "to AfD politicians from several federal states."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Maisha said, I have no knowledge about that."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for the constitutional protection, possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the party - in this case - the AfD - by certain individuals who are extremist, will change their direction and become so extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisive factor is whether such persons have control over the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"with a view to the significant increase in legal offences and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Majek said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this context."</seg>
<seg id="24">But in recent years we have found that there can be law-terrorism.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital Group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may well be that further right-wing terrorist groups or small groups form, plan the attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee camps or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">"a nationwide or pan-European control of legal terrorism, however, is not recognizable."</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Madas expressed concern about the fact that many encroachments went to the account of people, who had not previously appeared in the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the suspects of attacks on asylum accommodation were previously not known as criminals, politically motivated offences or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right-wing extremists, who might have been politically indifferent, or have chosen CDU, SPD or Left, who, however, radicalised themselves through right-wing extremist sentiments."</seg>

<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start from the international swimming association.</seg>

<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will be increased once again if appropriate measures for improvement are necessary."</seg>

<seg id="9">"over the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover caps from the previous calculation period were also to be equated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Schmidt explained that there were relatively small facilities with a very low waste water supply, lying between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low departmental basis."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the waste water volume in all three systems is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, due to their age refurbishment and repair expenses, the previous calculation period in all three plants had fallen to a considerable extent."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat says that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say that it is insensitive to races."</seg>
<seg id="3">"with its filtering tool, Snapchat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identities in such a way that borders on the absurd."</seg>
<seg id="4">"you can transform yourself into a pineapple, a dog or a figure that could be from Roy Lichtenstein's painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are immaculate, self-rotating tools that generate more than 30 million selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All false appearances come to the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">Snapchat filters have been critiques in the past when they were accused of using the app Blackface promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal.</seg>
<seg id="8">"when it proposed a filter to some users this week, which gave them slotted eyes, false teeth and darkened cheeks, some critics called it a racist caricature of Asians -" yellow factions. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves if these repeated controversies referred to a larger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"the news and indignation were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat announced that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was intended as a tribute to anime characters and not as caricature from Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders who have experienced racism, the filter recalled infringing clichés."</seg>
<seg id="13">Others decisively rejected the anime comparison.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in an e-mail, Grace Sparapani, a Korean-American art student whose tweets were widely spread across the photos that the filter was" "hurting and mild" "unpleasant."</seg>
<seg id="15">She added that "it is difficult to argue with the juxtaposition of a very contradictory asian caricature and the filter effects.</seg>
<seg id="16">"it shows that the filter is not yellow-sighted, but that the yellow face has been pulled into the absorbing extreme."</seg>
<seg id="17">Snapchat is not the only company that crosses this cultural tripping kite.</seg>
<seg id="18">"American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration, from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices we all hold in hand."</seg>
<seg id="19">And Snapchats great audience of young people - who are more verser than their older counterparts in terms of race - could expect more likely to expect sensitivity.</seg>
<seg id="20">"when one of Snapchats filters creates an image that is insulting for a user," it's much more difficult that such things remain unnoticed than it was before, "said the 25-year-old Katie Zhu in an interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as Product Manager and Engineer for Medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account and asked others to do the same."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in an essay for media and in a telephone interview, she said that she believes racial-related controversies reflect a lack of diversity in the attitudes of attitudes at Snapchat."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Zhu criticized the largely white, only male leadership and finished her essay with a hashtag: # DeleteSnapchat."</seg>
<seg id="24">"either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their staff so they can make such decisions," "said the Chinese Zhu," "or they have people with other skin colors that work there, but are not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it."</seg>
<seg id="25">"others share their opinion, a complaint that has largely left Snapchat unanswered."</seg>
<seg id="26">The company does not publish figures on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company.</seg>

<seg id="1">"military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence, sets Congress Committee"</seg>
<seg id="2">Military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence information to draw up an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria when the actual conditions were allowed on site in a report on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Army Committees, secret service committees and military budget comics, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command's intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence reports, typically inspired by high-level CentCom commanders, regularly featured a more positive picture of American efforts against terrorism when the actual conditions were allowed on site and were consistently positive as analyses of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at CentCom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "declared Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The leadership mistakes in the CentCom are reaching the top of the organisation.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed persistent problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in the training of the Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence suggesting that government tips under Obama have given instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts have exposed themselves to pressure from their previous laws, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were much more positive than the facts." "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossulphs could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigations, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the heads of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force into life after they were admitted that analysts worried about the manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed information while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the CentCom reports are underway by the Ministry of Defense's general inspector."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, the democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican task force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, CentCom has created an excessively restricted trial for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and Iraqi security services," "said the high-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this trial," Mr. Ship, "delayed the publication of intelligence reports," proclaimed the morality under analyst and "gave disproportionately little room for differing opinions."</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Ship and the Democrats gave no indication of the intervention of the White House at the CentCom analysts with regard to a "specific political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector who, after complaints by CentCom analysts, was reported."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a Pentagon spokesman, admitted in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on the Congress, while the Investigations of the General Inspector are still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admitted that" experts sometimes have quite divergent opinions about the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defence welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign led by an American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, the accusations of last year have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State reminds of intermediaries of more than ten years ago, when a CentCom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush, contrary to the recommendations of many analysts, foresaw just a small occupation force in Iraq and made little time to think about the consequences of the 2003 invasion."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in revolt against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker noted that, contrary to the statements of the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State had no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, as these temporary refineries would have put into operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>

<seg id="1">"the US gains fourth match in women's field-hockey, a showdown with the United Kingdom"</seg>
<seg id="2">"one day after shooting three goals during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam made the first two goals for the American field hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the American women won 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember ever having done that."</seg>
<seg id="4">"" "I have no idea." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their doors in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"she knows, however: the American women lie at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are also in their group with the Britons on the first place, which remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the last game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will be the strong Dutch slightly longer out of the way that lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the American women have triggered a surprising twist by their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games on the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey racket in her hands (her two older sisters played the sport at Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 as she couldn't qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which everything went wrong for her and her team."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, coach of the national team and thus began to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, mental change and a physical change," Bam said. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We didn't have the workaround in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to snatch the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the gates in the first half of the game with a backlash from the close range.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone into play without victory in the tournament, but the team was surprised and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into her hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and leaped the ball into the gate to get the American female a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the U.S. goalkeeper, Jackie Briggs, who had previously had to book a gate in each of the previous matches."</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position," said Parnham, but how good will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"amid the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of trampolines"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro have a constant and inevitable appearance, a raging season between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning rod, which is passed from the crossbow to the swimmer to the turner for triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to your neighbour in the queue in the queue, without listening to Simone Biles, Katie Leaky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a women's flock of dimples, could have been among those known names that are sent to Prime Time based on sponsors and feel-good-TV advertising if he was a swimmers, turner or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shade are the sports that are not generally recognized: airgun shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should be modest arguments for my particular darling, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampolines have been an Olympic event since 2000, when it made its debut in Sydney, the last 16 years have been so sparse that many of those I had asked weren't aware that it is at all an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the United States had prepared athletes for competition, it has never won a medal in trampolines and until 2012 had an athlete who managed it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to divide the prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year from London.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on the trampoline has some outsiders, partly because it sounds more suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownsmic than the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has a humorous potential - the cartoonical trembling of his never-ending impact - but also the Grazie of gymnastics and diving, the two sports that essentially unite."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "Trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"aspiring winner jumps on a giant trampoline, shoot up to 30 feet in the air and have to draw a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on the feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympic program, they are rated as level of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women will compete in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The most common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallists, in their quest for gold, have to go farther, faster, upward and over, sometimes up to the finish, sometimes back and forth, up and down on the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they not only hunt the finish line or the initial wall, but also a further highlight in the broadcast transmission: the world or the Olympiad."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal-directed quest is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even beat a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I feel as a bit tiring when looking at these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she kicks off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then down, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"here too there is competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympics can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and end-hours of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in the streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end times as part of a afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the terror and the objective of male athletes - according to The Wall Street Journal, the male US gymnasts recently proposed - then Mr. Dooley expects his new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protest in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met with violent resistance from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses testified that tens of protesters were killed during the clashes with the police in gunfire.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"over the last ten years, it has been one of the most stable countries of Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in the last months, protests against the government shook the country and expanded into more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">"last week, thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police were shot and killed in umpteen unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"in circulation, videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or the beginning of this year, show how security officers beat young people with sticks, while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights authority now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to combat terror driven beyond the region, especially Somalia. few countries in Africa, if at all, receive so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable rate.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital Addis Abeba.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continually led repression by the government - the opposition in the country has been reduced, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanses of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," "said Sea youm Teshome, a teacher in Central Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protested.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation protested.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from the use of land to stranglehold regarding the power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"following a widespread election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time, tensions continue along the border to Eritrea; a struggle for this jagged, controversial line demanded hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden, who have been enforced more or less in recent years, could use the turbulence and be able to arm themselves."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness explode under the surface after years of hardening under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, as cheaper smartphones were becoming more and more frequent and internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially in protests, many people can still communicate via internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians confess that they gathered in such a way as protests.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons Amperas, who mainly come from Ethiopia, prospered in politics and business as they exploited the Oromos, many of which are Muslims and live in flat-land areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But that is also changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are working under a screen," said Mulatu Miechu, a leader of the Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amperas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is unfairly dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which accounts for about 6 per cent of the population and which are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr Meles, a former rebel leader, until his death in a non-public illness in 2012 for 17 years, Ethiopia's prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think of corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to manipulate opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this fundamental skill," "said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopian new Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was selected for relatively obscure reasons to take the position of Mr Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"different from Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of Northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time Ethiopia experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after protesting thousands of elections which, according to the analysts" statements, apparently were fed by the government and subsequently stolen. "</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the following raids many protesters were killed, even if it was less than in the last months and this time of turmoil went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But apparently this has not prevented the intensification of the internal demise of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes on a dangerous ethnic form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters in Gondar, an amperical city, of Tigray conducted business and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring US and other Western allies into an odd position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as a basis for Dronenflights over neighboring Somalia, although she recently announced that she closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile area."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," "said Mr Abdi," "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim that Obama has established ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump, on Friday, tried to scatter the last controversy surrounding his campaign by anging that his multi-repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton were the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not meant seriously."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this clarification drew new questions about the communications capabilities of the presidential candidate of the Republicans, whether he was able to communicate clearly and comprehensibly with the American public."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings together his fellow campaigners, who endeavour to take protection during an eventful phase, in the peculiar position of explaining statements that he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"after having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump remarked with respect to the claim on Thursday and insisted that he really did not intend to suggest the president and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning weet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was the opposition to the previous day, in which Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate would not want to know anything about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism fell down on Mr. Trump, while trying to draw the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to declining demand."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton held speeches on the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again."</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestions would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he drew strong criticism when he said that the Russians were supposed to chop Mrs. Clinton's emails, but later he explained" "Of course I told the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then call back as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it's one of his methods to test how certain messages will be recorded by his fans as they arrive, and then" clarify "according to what the reaction is." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who monitors the language of both candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I also believe he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has estimated an even more corrosive sound as his survey values declined further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey conducted by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a major lead in the federal states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-in-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump has generally tried not to excuse himself for his provocative remarks, he often criticises his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while emphasizing the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze brought his loyal companions in the uncomfortable situation to stand up to him, no matter how provocative his statements might be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of the most prominent speakers in the world, had a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani said he was asked about the correctness of Mr. Trumpback's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama, ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called them backbiters, completely wrong and that's why it happened because he pulled out the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election campaign in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump made his attacks on the media, and accused them of being overwhelmed and biased at each of his words."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he mocked the" poor, miserable "TV experts who tried to understand him and said," You can't!. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats mocked Mr. Trump's excuse as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidential office.</seg>

<seg id="8">"a revived Verb Cafe opened in Greenpoint last November, less than a mile north of its original location."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the new verb has Wi-Fi and accepts credit cards, but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="10">The coffee is still good.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodriguez, a long-time associate of the old café, the owner and managing director of the new café."</seg>
<seg id="12">He started working in Verb in 2001 and stayed there until the end.</seg>
<seg id="13">"when a client offered to provide funds for a new branch office, he was excited to do it, he said."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Rodriguez, 36, kept a lot."</seg>
<seg id="15">Verb uses the same distributor for bagels bought the same espresso machine model.</seg>
<seg id="16">It even uses the same lamps from the old verb.</seg>
<seg id="17">But Rodriguez said he wanted to experiment.</seg>

<seg id="19">"there are sandwiches with bacon and cheese on the menu, and there are garnishes such as capers and saute onions."</seg>
<seg id="20">There are nature charters.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the café serves no beer, but there are fresh juices."</seg>
<seg id="22">"after nine months, Rodriguez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers."</seg>
<seg id="23">"many old customers were also displaced by prices from Williamsburg," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"recently, on a Sunday, Rebecca Oliveira was such a customer."</seg>
<seg id="25">"Oliveira, 34, lived in Williamsburg earlier and visited the club regularly."</seg>
<seg id="26">"even after she moved to Greenpoint, she would take the road."</seg>
<seg id="27">"after the verb had closed, she gave up the coffee for a while, she said."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was clear to me that it was in the coffee and culture that I liked," "she said."</seg>

<seg id="30">Tom Rosenthal has been another longstanding and faithful customer since the start of the club in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="31">He went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same.</seg>

<seg id="35">Rodriguez said he did not win a grudge against the fact that the soap business occupied the old business room.</seg>
<seg id="36">"in fact, the owners of the Soap Cherie offered a special soap for mixing with the cold-brewed coffee of the café as an ingredient."</seg>
<seg id="37">"I think we'll go to their offer yet," "said Rodriguez."</seg>
<seg id="38">And the traditional Polish inhabitants of Greenpoint have also accepted the café.</seg>
<seg id="39">"a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodriguez said he has prepared to issue them soon, so that his new neighbors feel welcome."</seg>
<seg id="40">The location also has other advantages.</seg>

<seg id="2">"in March 1933, shortly after his accession to the president, Franklin Delano Roosevelt took his lunch at the Oval Office."</seg>
<seg id="3">"as a gourmet, President Roosevelt had a passion for refined delicacies of Fifth Avenue like Pâte de foie gras and Maryland Turtle Soup Soup."</seg>
<seg id="4">"his menu on that day was a bit more modest: stuffed eggs in tomato sauce, potato puree and dessert a plum pudding."</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Briman. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband, Andrew Coe, added," It was also a message to Americans how to eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the last book" "Chop Suey" "was from Chinese cuisine in the USA, while brick was told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential building on the Lower East Side of the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"their latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will be published on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity when they met with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, frills snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate."</seg>
<seg id="12">"as the reporter appointed minced meat, this found the couple appropriate for a discussion about food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," said Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheaper that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts that they serve as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grinned.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have put itself in the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an All-You-Can-Eat-Buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women boiled for male fields and it was served freshly baked pastries for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during World War II." "a Square Meal" "records the ways with which the country was going to be no longer the land of land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when eating for Americans became a central, tense issue," Coe begged, why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new Budgetown was just as tensed: mysterious food, such as bread and casserole, became a staple food that could recycle food residues as a" "wonderful way to recycle food residues", "as the cooks were able to hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit has been replaced with cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the centre of American cuisine for years, became a rare luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">Odd mixtures have been tried out as a calorie rich and nutritious satisfaction is given precedence over taste or even healthy kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="27">"during their research for the book, which also includes prescriptions, brick man made a dish from this period, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was no popular additive at noon," says Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="29">Ziegelman further explains: "it was surreal.</seg>

<seg id="1">Grönlandhai: the oldest vertebrate is nearly 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland's sharks usually only come to the surface in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after an investigation, this shark was allowed to go back to the sea aboard the research ship Sanna."</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with a good 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland-haie get offspring only at 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely, the Grönland shark floats along the bottom of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is on average at an average of just 1,220 metres."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a rich 2.6 km / h - and at this top speed is half as fast as a seal."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterised by slowness, seems to be a patent for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal Science at least 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock, comments on this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates."</seg>
<seg id="12">The evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland hair will become stone age.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland harks are difficult to observe, after all they live mainly in the polar sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of the Greenland-sharks.</seg>
<seg id="17">Her slow motion measured her when she withered six animals with a transmitter in front of Spitzbergen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, this sharks thrive: in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">They may hunt dormant animals or patrol on the bottom of the ice sea and look for cadaver who torwards from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues examined 28 Greenland hooks that fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimetre was measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is created before the birth of the sharks, the proteins it contains will not be renewed later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"therefore, its birth was supposed to lie after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons research hurled large amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third smallest animal with 220 centimeters length, the lens core, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in their lentil core, however, all larger Greenland harks had normal carbon-14-amounts formed by cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock showed an age of 335 years for a 493 centimeter long, while the record shark with 502 centimetres was even 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">That Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters was known.</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">"as one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood on the threshold to maturity and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-haie with multiplication is obviously at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is no coincidence that such methane-caustic areas live mainly in icy waters.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in which bacon at the neck was a 120 year old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on a flame-flame."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are also often very big."</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The loss of heat of one gram of mouse is therefore much greater than in one gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very big animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"therefore, the city on the Main has the best opportunities to attract jobs and companies from London by competing with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg."</seg>

<seg id="2">The altar boys from the Eyachtal Eye Hospital St. Anna were on the way to Freiburg on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>

<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time until the next Romance trip of all the registrants in two years, the round of ministries St. Anna decided to prepare and carry out a multi-day pilgrimage."</seg>

<seg id="6">"16 Minis from Bittelbronn, and Gruol, and Haigerloch and Heiligenzimmern made his way."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last night in the men's team sprint in Velodrom in Rio to fame when the British team announced the London 2012 title.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor, which his compatriot Sir Chris Hoy had made his own."</seg>
<seg id="4">"four years ago, England claimed a shocking victory while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals."</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they picked up only a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships in spite of the appearance of Hoys.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as a hindrance.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement produced a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the Scots that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy winning - and Skinner used the qualifying rounds as an olympic record, but in the standard rounds, the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">But Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it.</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation in which Hindu went in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and, above all, Skinner to keep the pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked from his position as a BBC expert and fell on Skinner, Kenny and Hinder when they got on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said," It's a flattering comparison. "</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the final round, we set up an Olympic sailing chord and defeated the world champions."</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just incredible.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the victory in 2012 at the Kennys and Hoys page, Hinder admitted that after a weak start he intentionally fell on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">"said Mr Hinder:" "it feels like the whole GB of flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We came so badly with so many world titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which has won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">If this is a barometer of our progress in the last five months we expect successful five days in the bicycle flash.</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it is possible to repeat Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (a seemingly holy date for British sport; on that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be equal to that of Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny is now taking part in the sprint that starts today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said:" "I only enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always the best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with your colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a little lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at 3: 51.942 at the finish.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51.659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on safety.</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday, he had argued with representatives before the qualification, when functionaries called him to measure his body size."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women's competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shand, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in world record time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to take a host of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, expectations for Rio have been shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Dramas took place in the background, with the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April in the midst of sexism and mobbing demonstrations as well as the retirement of sizes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks like the now legendary reputation GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melt-smelting of Portland due to the suspension of energy yield questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melt from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workers" workstations - are at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby cancels all delivery contracts, such as the supplying energy company. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the government's decision at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">"up to 2,000 jobs in the Alcoa plant in Portland are at stake."</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 workstations - direct as well as indirect - could be endangered in case of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, there could be domino effects since the melt is consumed around 10 percent of the total power generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa concluded Point Henry Melting, leading to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The smelting of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation about the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and finally due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, supplying the large aluminium melting facility with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will terminate their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is in the majority ownership of a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through smelting," "said the company."</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were so-called" "hedging business", "which should come into force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">The contracts have a 12 month notice period so that they will end in 2017.</seg>
<seg id="16">"consequently, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenues in the financial year 17," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impact on the revenue on AGL from the GJ 18 is currently limited by the forecast of strong retail prices for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">"AGL announced that it had already depreciated the value of the contracts in its annual subsidy amounting to $187 million in" "Termination of Termination". ""</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the treaties, the" Alcoas "ability... to operate the melt or to guarantee the electricity supply to the melt" does not compromise. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that in 2010 it concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, which would have come into force from November this year even if it is still an explanation why it has withdrawn from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the poor economic conditions in the industry before closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"referring to the analysts" statements at the beginning of the week, Head of Operations said Stephen Mikkelsen, that Portland use some 600 MW of Megawatt and Tomago to consume around 900 megawatts each year. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and it wouldn't be good for us as a generator," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner Clans Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on their Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover brought me to tears," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or just Keeping Up with the Kardashians like that?), a crawling reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn) as well as in the presence of the universally popular Showbiz-uncle and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacrest: they all have planned a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the cliché plot almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacremnant took the phrase," You thought we had forgotten you?, "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls participate somehow in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, certainly a new era of dashereh has begun."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her, as far as Vogue covers were concerned (they and her husband Kanye West were on it in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for itself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold issue of the year for vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a volume that resembles more an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the output draws a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The unveiling of his cover stars is eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine went through even before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who have already been on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years there have been clearly more" celebrities, modeling "as" models that are celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar winner and brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, a year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the little chance that Ms. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation, falls under the earlier category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to celebrities or reality stars or young people of today who know how to turn a good snapshot video (even if everything is true to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are truly talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners's success is not pleasing to everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with her reality TV story, Jenner's position in the world of fashion has always been somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticised them and called them "the mistletoes of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were once again high when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But going around on the displeasure seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September issue of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">She runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">You and all your sisters sell you pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells photographs of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine "LOVE."</seg>
<seg id="30">And in her free time she is to be seen in reality TV. probably just to see her sister Kourtney and her children.</seg>

<seg id="2">"email and internet in slow motion: twenty years ago, the Nokia Communicator launched the market."</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors dominated the world today - his manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed nearly half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, therefore it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite clunky."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which would now suffice for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"just 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, the" Nokia 9000 communicator "entered the shops - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few Euros, fans can buy the devices on the internet, but they somehow come from the Internet age's Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the Cebit trade fair in Hanover as an office in the west pocket format.</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for those standards: SMS and emails could be sent and received, also by fax was the communicator."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even accessing websites was possible by HTML browsers, albeit slow."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average selling price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 Euro in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in August of 1996, no one could suspect that the communicator would be the beginning of the smart phone era."</seg>
<seg id="21">Everything has changed ever since.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story even if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">The Finns mobile phone business experienced an unprecedented disaster and was eventually sold and handled at Microsoft.</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, vendors are dominating the market that came much later than Nokia."</seg>
<seg id="25">"to be online anytime and anywhere, this is everyday life for a lot of people."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide."</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity to our local communities and throughout London.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me it was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just like in 2012 in London, when we made a great effort to make sure all of our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics had great benefits for Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new jobs alone, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of Heathrow's expansion is too great."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be blamant on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the doubters were wrong in 2012, and they will also be wrong with Heathrow."</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcoming, but Heathrow answers any question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in economic growth and to leave a legacy of skills and jobs both to the airport and the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team in Heathrow, who implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment programme in time and budget, from the T5 - which was built for five years as a result of the world's best airport terminal, until the T2, which was built in the midst of the two busiest catwalks in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to deliver a third catwalk, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">The London games of 2012 were a great success for UK and I am confident that the expansion of Heathrow will also be one.</seg>
<seg id="16">It is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and to broaden Heathrow as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of.</seg>

<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook shared that his desktop page would change the encoding with respect to his adverts to make it more difficult to detect which part of the page advertisement is."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it had found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post, Adblock Ben Williams" spokesman wrote that "this kind of hate-and-forth struggle between the time-curving open source community and the hangers has been underway since the invention of display blockers," and that it is possible that Facebook soon comes with a new solution.

<seg id="2">The victim was in the middle of the night on the highway.</seg>
<seg id="3">The police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday passed on to a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a motorway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred shortly after midnight on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman lay in the dark" in an act of despair "on the street and were hit by several cars, the police officer said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, who was overpowered by several vehicles, including a truck, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have still not been identified, the police told them, as well as every witness of the incident, to report himself."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigative process was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter shared with the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"this is something the prosecutor has to decide," "said Hofstetter."</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases - in which a person ran in the dark on the highway - it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian is running in the middle of the night on the highway, as stated in the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year, a police officer was acquitted of the negligent killing, after passing over and killing a man who was laying on the A1 near Payerne in August 2014."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the 22-year-old victim had drunk and was unconscious on the street, took the court."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably once inhabited."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies at NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus using tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate researchers.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere could once have retreated similar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by their dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and nevertheless slowly turned on."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to shelter life and protect against rapid evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the gISS model simulation, the slow turning of Venus highlights its daylight-side of the sun for almost two months," explained Keller scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously thought by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was supposedly inhabited, Venus was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light in the course of several billions years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burned away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"when her Hydrogen escaped, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, as we know it today."</seg>

<seg id="3">"the new data help astronomers understand why stars rotate in star cluster to different rates, as well as in what context the rotational periods are associated with planet creation."</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that through comparing our results with other stars, more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," "said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release."</seg>

<seg id="6">"many stars in this cluster, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, are now reaching adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at peak rotations, these mature stars repel large amounts of starches."</seg>

<seg id="1">Datenklau: so perfide blackers blackers their ransom</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by the malware anti-defense specialists Malwarebytes (among 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany), 40 percent of the companies surveyed in the past twelve months have been at least once, partially victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already the target of a ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">Forty per cent of the victims willingly paid the ransom demanded by the perpetrators in order to be able to use the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">"according to Malwarebytes's observations, the perpetrators are specializing in attacks on corporate networks."</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to blackout ransom is much higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently observing a startling rapid evolution of the malware," says Malwarebytes Executive Marcin Klecturski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the software programs were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks was scary over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once active on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">The software then presents the demands of the blackmail press.</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the final code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptocurrencies Bitcoin -."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users are interested in the personal photo database at stake, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production standstill."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage occurs when a ransomware hits."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of the German companies affected reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely break the business activity, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">Several hospitals in Germany have already been victims of attacks whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of records.</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims: don't pay, you only support the problem," says Klecturski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies who pay will get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in view of a standstill in operation, it is difficult for managers to reject the demands of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know that and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure tested the user interfaces and the contact with the blackmail users and came to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims per chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set free accessible support sites, or decode for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private people are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies have to negotiate hard and pay 5-digit amounts to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in view of the potentially high and relatively risky gains from ransomware blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share their work, explains security expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider Sophos:" a single person can write a ransomware around within a week.

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the small HR-V, Honda wants to pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé, and the versatility of a mini van."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds fairly overloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform like the new jazz, actually proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the HR-V only affects only 1.60 m, the passengers have plenty of space in the first row as well as in the rear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the interior materials are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the upper side of the cockpit is falling apart."</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles.</seg>
<seg id="8">"there is not only a luggage compartment of 453 l at high-placed and 1026 l with folded back rests, but there is the Magic Seats."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the backrest can be folded up like the seats, offering storage space that is 1,24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the boot is well loaded, but the height of the cargo is 650 mm higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp speeds up the HR-V very powerfully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>
<seg id="12">"however, he should do his job softly."</seg>
<seg id="13">The daily consumption of 4.7 l / 100 km is pleasing.</seg>
<seg id="14">There is another engine: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">An all-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort."</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be somewhat more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the equipment in the tested top variant" "Executive" "leaves nothing to be desired."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the security systems include the city emergency braking system (working up to speed 32), the collision warning system and the lane assist assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects" when manoeuvring.</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent speed controller responds to traffic sign detection and throttles the speed when needed.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but the full connectivity is only available for top equipment: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation system, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI jack are located under the armrest and are therefore somewhat cumbersome to achieve.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the roughly 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesel are fine."</seg>
<seg id="26">"those who don't want to invest so much will get the petrol engine starting from 20000 Euro, the diesel of 23,000 euros."</seg>

<seg id="1">Relaxing night: tips for sleeping disorders</seg>
<seg id="2">"in the evening, you roll around forever, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep well before the alarm bells."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is all but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, one is in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as non-restorative."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep problems manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many causes for them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Sleep Therapy and Sleeping Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one understands provisionally, however, is the insomnia, that is, an in- and sleep disorder."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the sleeping feels many people as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German Medical Association, with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony."</seg>
<seg id="9">What's behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"behind this, organic, psychological or behavioural factors, but also medication."</seg>
<seg id="12">"infrequently, sleep disorder is an expression of another disease."</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is most common in a depression," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"for example, who has a herniated disc, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts pondering about everyday problems and worries, there is an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">This leads to tension and sleep is no longer possible.</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep problems become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">Anyone who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week should go to the doctor.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look quite different: you are beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headache."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep problems, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include, among other things, behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy, or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any lowered sleep medicine in Germany, emphasizes Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary Sleep Medicine Centre of the Charité University Medicine Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, in case of sleep problems one should first turn to the family doctor, advised Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by examining whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what will happen?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, in the sleep laboratory, doctors recommend snoring with breathing agents, in case of fatigue, for sleepwalkers, or if you don't find the cause of a sleeping disorder," explains Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="27">You don't have to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only do not make a nap," says Fietze. "</seg>
<seg id="30">After dressing you go to bed at his normal time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a feeler at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera at the ceiling shows the sleeping person."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a number of adjusting screws that can be used for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"weaving counts on: regular sleep and stop times, do not lie too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, don't watch TV for falling asleep, avoid alcoholic drinks and do not look at the watch at night - then you start to reckon immediately, and that's not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, a couple of lime brooks, in between still a rest of cobblestones: the Riga Street in Berlin-Friedrichshain does not affect the first sight, but the police force them to the" dangerous places "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"along the road from east to west, one passes by playgrounds, a freshly painted kindergarten and a bioladen."</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" sprayed on the facade of a grey house.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in front of a Lidl, which will soon be demolished, it is already being built: until 2017, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here."</seg>
<seg id="5">"article about this" "trendy neighbourhood", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is, however, preferred over the last few weeks with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have rented contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin interior senator Henkel has repeatedly called for a hard action by the police against the project, the area known as the" no-go zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after three weeks of official statements tidied on the ground floor, the Kadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, the police patrobed official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three team wagons on site, locked sections of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, on behalf of the unknown homeowners, the building workers were renovating the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court ruled that the clearing had been illegal and a day later police and construction workers retired under the cheering of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the road works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others are talking about late night."</seg>
<seg id="12">There is a primary school and kindergartens in the immediate vicinity of the house projects.</seg>
<seg id="13">"left violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who is attracting three children, are especially annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the residents of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez who wanted mostly police protection from the vandalizing left.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the Graben, the Berlin senator and the police between the occupiers and their neighbors, apparently does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain, East of Berlin, was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which today has a low average income and a high risk of poverty compared to the rest of the city."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, among them almost the entire Mainzer Straße close to the Rigaer."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under large police orders in a real street battle, many of the projects in the Rigaer were legalized and partly inhabited by the people who had occupied it 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years the district has become increasingly becoming a magnet for tourists and balustrades from all over the world: residents from East Germany and former home occupiers are now sharing their neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also noticeable in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 in new lease companies."</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the new buildings in the Rigaer are attacked as symbols for this development: they can be seen on wined panes or freshly painted façades, which were discarded with paint bags."</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words "leftist violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason for not all neighbours to view this as a problem could be that they are not necessarily affected by the crime: crimes such as body damage are, according to statistics, almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the criminal offences are made of material damages, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer who has lived in a rented house for 17 years next to the controversial 94, there can be no question of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for acts of violence, it is appeasing: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they were certainly not."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer give it to the Rigaer anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architecture, her street is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here, one helps each other, lives along the road and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer was consciously drawn to the Rigaer Straße - and stayed.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that's why it was so important for her that the residents get their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly claimed the significance of the district."</seg>
<seg id="32">"but in the eyes of inhabitants such as Neugebauer, the street will continue to be taken away from them: through faceless new buildings in former building spaces that the old inhabitants suppress."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well drunk here live here," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"I am absolutely not able to endorse violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should we do if someone never stops?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, even with the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are angry about color bombs: the house projects and the left-hand scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>
<seg id="38">"those who draw, should be aware of it - just like someone who moves into a pub, can complain badly about noise."</seg>

<seg id="6">"she sees herself as a contact for all actors: refugees, working group Refugee aid, administration, authorities and anyone else involved."</seg>
<seg id="7">Regine customer from the working group indicates that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is there; the ice-relieving pleasure milksau that has above all a problem.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less ridiculously as much more targeted than the multitude of desired tasks - meant that the administration wanted to write the job."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an administrative professional with a talent for languages and people was sought, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an ice-reliant wool-milksau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not their central area, Annika Deuschle writes."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50 percent position for three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," Regine customer says that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and minor problems, organizational, human and communication problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">"soon, new containers are standing in the washing street"</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The local authorities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">You will have to accommodate the refugees in your own or rented living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the councillor to the municipality and the job center.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every owner wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it doesn't work, you need to rely on private apartments, such as Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common dwellings must be reinforced as it is called so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But it is not only with apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a fixed stay, there are internships, training centres, school grounds, one-euro jobs and assistance to refugees and migrants who need to be harmed or furnished."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," Regine customer reports. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help homeowners, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will result in a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and above all language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, here too, administration and honorary official jump."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is essential that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the proceedings is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain the refugees that it just takes and they can make sense of time, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who at some point develop the feeling that he can't help anyone in Urbach, can't work and be unprofitable, he will never be able to integrate himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority was motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"but there are also problems, says the customer honestly," people with whom nothing goes. "therefore, the work of Deuschle and customer is always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">"all this is already a" "mammoth task." ""</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: after the recent occurrences, do the two have fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no, Regine's customer says quite clearly" what a certain naive might call. "a residual risk could and would not exclude it."</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would be afraid that the assassins will complete them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," Regine says. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials have to look for activities locally and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They have always been in the background that soon a new impetus for refugees and migrants could come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics abhors itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"actually, it is unfair to put them on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach we haven't arrived where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine's customer also makes it clear that the Urbach has already been utilized to sensibly integrate the previous people.</seg>
<seg id="63">"currently, these are about 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
