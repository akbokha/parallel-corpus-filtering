Obama receiving Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal struck by Obama around Iran &apos;s nuclear program has further worsen@@ ed the relationship of the two .
&quot; in March , at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , Net@@ any@@ ahu has held a controversial speech rated as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election with reference to the election in Israel at that time . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , professor asks his girlfriend to have shot &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told the police that he had shot his girlfriend and that the officials would have to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably upset , and he said that the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand written note that was scri@@ b@@ bled on a white block : &quot; &quot; I &apos;m so sorry I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who taught two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , already had 300 miles to the school premises , where he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb made the fatal distress call at some point .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; one day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and teachers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and employees who knew him , helped to draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty includes 17 members , and many students visited courses of both . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , there were a number of tendencies to problematic behavi@@ ours . &quot;
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said that he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; previously , Lamb had asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said he had any health problem . &quot;
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; the latest changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the doc@@ torate , which had worked so hard for the Lamb , would be no guarantee for an automatic path to an employment as Assistant professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
these are questions which Lamb can no longer answer .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 Cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner methane Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said that she believed that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants , teaching ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he completed his doc@@ torate in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charis@@ matic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met through common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar playing . &quot;
&quot; at that time , he was the s@@ warm of women . &quot;
&quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in Jackson &apos;s subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
they had a dog named Light@@ ning who lived with them in the brick house adjoining Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier .
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; &quot; said O &apos;@@ St@@ een about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said he never met Lamb , but through his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail spent three years ago both on a summer carnival market . &quot;
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ St@@ een said his daughter writes and sings its own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bark@@ e@@ eper and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a dim@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September for the last time after Lamb finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play ended before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no indication that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were in the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first @-@ semester program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three small children .
&quot; he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was President of his br@@ otherhood and student committee . &quot;
&quot; at the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and on Tuesday evening about 900 people , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the congregation joined a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght memorial service . &quot;
Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the M@@ ahn@@ rig and sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back , &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press authors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebe@@ cca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that Lamb is now saying that Lamb made the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb in his distress call was Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for the Christmas season
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that it won &apos;t be so many Christmas seasonal employees like last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the staff and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it would plan to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said that it will start in this month with interviews and the number of employees from October to December is increasing .
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equi@@ p shops with employees that sell , send and deliver products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox v@@ j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als , and I realise that the seat next to me is empty and it gradually becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I am a simulated y@@ aw@@ n and a length of arm away from being with the Princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , a documentary about &quot; Back to the Future , &quot; presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; Spiel@@ berg said , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time @-@ travel film ever shot . &quot;
&quot; back in Time will be shown on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected theaters in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon , said his answer to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; there is no military solution &quot; of the almost five @-@ year conflict , and more weapons will ag@@ grav@@ ate violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support integr@@ ative negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the br@@ ink of the Minist@@ erial Meeting of the General Assembly this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers &quot; &quot; make this situation un@@ sol@@ vable . &quot; &quot; &quot;
ban urged the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria that they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 Survey results show that Donald Tr@@ ump is serious .
some have tried to brand it as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some re@@ public@@ ans try to pull Donald Tr@@ ump from the top ranks in surveys , it has ( yet ) not worked . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Tr@@ ump in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating the real estate mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
no one claims that Tr@@ ump is likely to win the Repub@@ lican nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time , in 2011 Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the asc@@ ending Her@@ man Cain , of whom no one also won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bus@@ hs Super PAC@@ C and the conservative business group Club for Growth now recognise Tr@@ ump &apos;s staying power and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values indicating that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
s@@ ling@@ backs have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tr@@ ump announced his candid@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey by Mon@@ mouth University showed that only two of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of August , it was 52 percent . &quot;
&quot; now , six out of ten re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tr@@ ump . &quot;
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa reported last week that 60 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tr@@ ump .
two thirds of the GO@@ P @-@ voters GO@@ P would be happy with Tr@@ ump as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l last week , 67 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; enthusiastic &quot; or &quot; satisfied &quot; when Tr@@ ump was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of them say that they &quot; &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tr@@ ump ( 43 percent say they would be &quot; enthusiastic &quot; vs. 40 percent , which say the same about Tr@@ ump ) . &quot;
the next in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 percent of Repub@@ lican voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; anno@@ yed &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the Est@@ abl@@ ishment &apos;s favorite , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans does not see b@@ umps temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tr@@ ump is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive comments , 52 percent of Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is valid in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively perform his office , and almost six out of ten independ@@ ents say that his tem@@ per does not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters become accustomed to the idea .
&quot; when they put up their hon@@ our@@ able hats , repub@@ lican vot@@ er Tr@@ ump consider real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who is most likely to win the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a CN@@ N / OR@@ C pol@@ l from last week , four out of ten say that Tr@@ ump is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July set their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
&quot; at that time in the last cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; nonetheless , it shows that a variety of GO@@ P vot@@ er Tr@@ ump@@ ets campaign can be viewed as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans gathered around another candidate , Tr@@ ump ki@@ cks almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts point out that the fragmented field is likely to contribute to b@@ umps lead , whereas the anti @-@ Tr@@ ump Support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tr@@ ump and most other Repub@@ lican candidates , Tr@@ ump has picked up the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points ahead , before Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it is a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate that beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a scar@@ ce majority of Donald Tr@@ ump fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new C@@ BS / NY@@ T survey on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of voters supporting Tr@@ ump , say they have forgiven their votes . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; however , Tr@@ ump is strongest competition at the moment the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tr@@ ump . &quot;
six out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump on the subject of immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tr@@ ump , in his election campaign two months ago , called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; the immigration and fishing point in the public discourse was in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tr@@ ump will keep pi@@ vot@@ al His@@ pan@@ o Americans away from the Repub@@ lican Party and will damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but according to the new ABC / post survey of Monday , six out of ten re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tr@@ ump in questions of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration into the lim@@ eli@@ ght remains , Donald Tr@@ ump will appear to be doing too . &quot;
the fru@@ stration of the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tr@@ ump and Ben Car@@ son account for about half of the support of repub@@ lican voters , above all due to their out@@ si@@ ders status . &quot;
&quot; six out of ten Repub@@ lic@@ ans say in the new Monday survey of ABC / Post , they prefer to have a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also mad at Washington .
&quot; a survey by Des Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa , two weeks ago , shows that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are fru@@ strated by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress , with 54 per cent &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; pol@@ ite anno@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
the most expensive residential complex is located here in the Hob@@ o@@ ken@@ weg - with a view over the North Sea resort .
&quot; in the street , a square meter of a roof @-@ roof house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations a square meter most costs .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top residential areas , the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ el has published a ranking of the most exclusive German resi@@ dences - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro nix - per square meter , well marked . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way : here , Munich is not at the top . &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bavaria @-@ dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
two pi@@ es in Pi@@ ra@@ eus : Bayern @-@ star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a happy hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a well deserved 3 : 0 at Olympic Games Pi@@ ra@@ eus - then ran it .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; world champi@@ ons Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave a dream start to FC Bayern in the &quot; &quot; Mission Milan &quot; &quot; hex@@ enk@@ armchair by Pi@@ ra@@ eus . &quot;
the team of trainers P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their wake @-@ up play in the Champions League in the Greek record champion of Olympic champi@@ ons in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ th + 2 ) and id@@ ol@@ aters ( 8@@ 9th ) deserves at 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth starting success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28th , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; on his 28th result in the Champions League , Müller won the gra@@ cious support of Olympic Champion Roberto , who had a f@@ lange @-@ thought shot of the World Champion to pass . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; Bavaria @-@ captain Philipp Lah@@ m promised before the game in the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich kept word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and dedicated imagination without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ ra@@ eus had won his most recent six home matches in the world class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled here in 2011 .
&quot; but the Bav@@ arians , defeated in seven Europ@@ ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they gra@@ c@@ efully walked , but often in@@ oper@@ atively with their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were too often initiated by a shift on the left @-@ wing Douglas Costa , which was rarely heard against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k struck from the right half @-@ field in the left upper right @-@ hand corner .
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the world champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best opportunities in half one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; at first , when Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ storms Ide@@ ye Brown hit the pole of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ted with his knee ( 35 . ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians had their usual dominant play , Pi@@ ra@@ eus could set con@@ i@@ fers . &quot;
&quot; however , on ago@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er was reli@@ eved . &quot;
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot of ideas about the Lat@@ te ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before Neu@@ er , Guardi@@ ola was able to defend a four @-@ chain with David Al@@ aba in the center of Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , which made it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cabin , sat outside first . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after final training , said sports steering Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; anyone who wants to make something different is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the killed Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Göt@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , with a penalty of eleven meters . &quot;
&quot; in front of the game , it had come to Kra@@ w@@ allen in the stadium . &quot;
&quot; after a smaller group of war@@ med Bavarian fans in their spect@@ ator block obviously provoked parti@@ sans of hosts Pir@@ äus with words and gestures , the security forces interven@@ ed and attacked the Munich supporters . &quot;
at least one Bayern fan was injured in the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam @-@ long @-@ term study . &quot;
good news : aband@@ on@@ ment decreases the risk quickly .
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several employees of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 @-@ times higher . &quot;
the scientists had observed more than 23.@@ 300 participants .
&quot; main causes of tooth decay are tooth decay and inflammation of the gum , highlighted by the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , stress the authors . &quot;
the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore related to more frequent gin@@ gi@@ vi@@ tis in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of c@@ aries .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ment sin@@ ks again to the level of non @-@ smokers , explained author Thomas Dietrich of the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must persu@@ ade people to be non @-@ smokers , stated director H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
not smoking is good for lungs and blood vessels and results in good dental health until the age of old .
&quot; in Germany , over 20 per cent of the population aged 65 to 74 years was affected by tooth@@ lessness , the DI@@ f@@ E divided . &quot;
previous studies have already indicated that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ scores the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet lef@@ to@@ vers from the late Anti@@ quity on the shores of Cologne
&quot; for the ump@@ teenth time , archaeological finds have been made at the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; in the vicinity of the construction site for the new Rhine bou@@ lev@@ ard , arch@@ e@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , &quot; said Museum Director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always added to the Department of Arch@@ ae@@ ological Land@@ gra@@ vation . &quot;
&quot; in the third section of the Rhein@@ bou@@ lev@@ ard , archae@@ ologists have now found it . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it was already known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the remains of the fortress and the church tower , there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves that belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman of freight cap@@ tures
&quot; after a young woman at the railway station in Bad Gei@@ ber@@ ir@@ chen @-@ Lin@@ dern is un@@ fortunate , the Federal Police kindly asks the population for assistance . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning , at 1.@@ 40@@ am , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; by capturing the train , she bore the he@@ avi@@ est injuries from the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated as a doctor on the spot and taken to a hospital by ambul@@ ance services .
&quot; on the basis of the noc@@ tur@@ nal equ@@ ation of the young woman , there is no evidence of the medi@@ ating function@@ aries . &quot;
the incident could possibly be witnessed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; local people or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Rail , Ziegel@@ ker@@ cker@@ weg , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ straße and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) are in@@ quired . &quot;

EU Commission propos@@ ing new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; to intensi@@ fy the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement TTIP , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration equipment for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way of functioning properly corresponds to more traditional courts . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in charge of the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de prefers to bring the proposal as a European negotiating position in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced its support .
&quot; by TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is to rise with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceeding fores@@ ee that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new investment court .
&quot; they are to come from equal parts of the EU , the United States and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is planned . &quot;
it would allow obj@@ ections to be raised against Ur@@ prejudi@@ ce .
&quot; until now , the Trial Chamber agreed with each other on arbitr@@ ators , there was no objection to their jud@@ gements . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in the debate over the past few months it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice failed to trust , Malm@@ ström commented . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all from large corporations are considered to be one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against the TTIP .
&quot; the traditional arbit@@ ration courts are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , through which companies can claim damages to the tax@@ pa@@ yers , lev@@ ard national laws or enforce a reduction of consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act described the European Commission &apos;s proposals as insufficient . &quot;
&quot; above all , it was critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the German State Secretary Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) described the plans as great progress . &quot;
&quot; in the spring , the Commission took into account essential points that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , worked with other EU trade ministers in the spring . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European Business Federation business Europe warned that it would limit the economics of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , particularly small and medium @-@ sized companies could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
it remains unclear when the negotiations on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded .
negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the issue of investor protection has not been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should already be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered un@@ sustainable .
delicate Folk by Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
eleven years ago Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is sitting on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) .
next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart showing the shy acting fol@@ ks@@ ler to the picturesque US state of Mich@@ ig@@ an with felt pen .
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost taken by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of various places , which he repeatedly records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ ci@@ ous and delic@@ ately arranged songs . &quot;
where they were created and how it looks like in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderfully creative Ir@@ ren . &quot;
with the 2003 published and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ ig@@ an : the Great Lake State &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs that blend harmon@@ i@@ ously with American folk in the late six@@ ties but can always drift into great opul@@ ent tones at any time .
&quot; rum@@ or , &quot; Mich@@ ig@@ an &quot; would be the first part of a bold series : each of the 50 states should be held in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; &quot; has already appeared and breaks positively certain expectations . &quot;
reduces St@@ ev@@ ens here .
guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
&quot; one year later , the musician who lives in New York returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) is a celebrated masterpiece in 2005 .
bri@@ mming with ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the American Bill@@ board charts and lacks in any annual list of influential music media .
&quot; after very productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then relies on &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive of electronic pro@@ positions . &quot;
&quot; this sixth full studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , yet played by sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effects and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; from the smaller clubs , the stage shows are turned into a colourful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and big fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the glo@@ om@@ ily kept Hamburger More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although almost 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the much more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and you can actually throw away the &quot; &quot; sla@@ b &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only to an en@@ core thanks St@@ ev@@ ens mo@@ dest@@ ly , acousti@@ cally plays few older songs and finally tends to fall under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ mes
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns made his debut at the prime minister &apos;s questionna@@ ires &quot;
&quot; the new Labour leader , Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , will make his debut at the prime minister &apos;s cargo and set up for the first time with David Cameron . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to address the first of his six given questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MPs from the vicinity . &quot;
he called for &quot; fewer theatres and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave them to colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary scrut@@ iny for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the shadow cabinet and after his speech at the TU@@ C annual meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Labour leader &apos;s decision to remain silent during a commem@@ oration ceremony on Tuesday during a commem@@ oration ceremony on the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , critic@@ ising a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs , is the focus of several Tit@@ le @-@ stories in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man for Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he acknowledged the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s shadow cabinet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow ministers refused to serve Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they appe@@ aled to differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the Par@@ liam@@ entary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
the political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences also within Labour &quot; stack &quot; according to Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s remarks on the position of the European Union and the limitation of women .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes are in place to remove the whole idea of a constra@@ int altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow worker and pensions minister said that the party was &quot; very clear &quot; that it was only against the government plans to cut the limit of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron since he is T@@ ory CEO over the Dis@@ patch Box in the Parliament over the last decade .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised a different policy set , says he has &quot; &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s questionna@@ ires are too confron@@ t@@ ational , and that he is subjected to both &quot; &quot; skill &quot; &quot; and the dispute with re@@ tain@@ ers and instead of focusing on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle the shadow of the economic minister is represented when he doesn &apos;t take part - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad .
&quot; he has also discussed the idea that other colleagues may occasionally speak the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the house , in order to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; Ju@@ dy @-@ Ju@@ dy @-@ Theater , &quot; often associated with the prime minister &apos;s frame . but a few years later he admitted that he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the questionnaire was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the judgment of a leader and its leadership in the House of Parliament and its position among its parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that they have become a car@@ ic@@ ature and need far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

Po@@ und increases by acceler@@ ating wage growth in the UK
&quot; the pound rose sharply according to data , which indicate an increase in the UK wage growth . parallel to this , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the goal SA@@ B@@ Miller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without bonuses in the UK grew by 2.@@ 9 % compared to the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and most advanced estim@@ ations at the time of an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and was up to 0.@@ 84 % compared with the euro to € 1,@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1.@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share on the market and made a leap of 20 % after tak@@ eover offer of rival AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; one transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher following encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Ri@@ chem@@ ont .
the latest sales figures hit all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth again .
Gl@@ en@@ core shares rose 5 % after the mining giant said that he had earned $ 2.5 billion through stock sales as part of its debt reduction strategy .
&quot; the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper group were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had put his app@@ rais@@ al for the company R@@ ating on &quot; Sale . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sports management company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the boss of J@@ D Sports says higher wages are endanger@@ ing the expansion .
the Managing Director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ gil@@ l says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs in his company , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could affect the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are fewer additional jobs . &quot;

like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .

who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even Bi@@ eber himself doesn &apos;t .
he has already taken care of it anyway .
&quot; for the advertisement in the promotional blu@@ epr@@ int of the super@@ visor he c@@ ashed out three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ imp@@ le company washed many , many dollars to the Bi@@ eber account . &quot;
&quot; and every doll , which looks like he and goes over the counter , also collects Bi@@ eber . &quot;
&quot; when J@@ ustin Bi@@ eber drinks a coffee , one mar@@ vels at the window pane . &quot;
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e would go too far .
&quot; others stress that Bi@@ eber is in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in 1st place . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ eber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os first . &quot;
&quot; at least , he does so . &quot;
Pe@@ gi@@ da poster brings Lebanese to the idea of Pot@@ ato Tre@@ es
potatoes or twe@@ eters ?
&quot; both - and in the potato dy@@ nasty , developed by the Ol@@ den@@ burger snack owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay Pot@@ el and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster with a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen random@@ ly on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , a gri@@ lling dish , which is sto@@ cked with meat and potatoes , has been in his store . &quot;
&quot; this is mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the idea has submitted to the Lebanese patent office at the patent office in Munich . &quot;
&quot; there , according to the authorities , it has recently been protected as a utility patent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Al@@ hay does not want to reveal how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer has . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; even with its customers , the international understanding of international understanding is good . &quot;
met@@ a launches Pri@@ ority Camp@@ a@@ ign to combat Al@@ di@@ - In@@ cre@@ ase
met@@ a is trying to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a Con@@ stance Camp@@ a@@ ign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; during Al@@ di &apos;s opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ a and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the brand I@@ GA through mainstream marketing and marketing through the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de Show . &quot;
&quot; I@@ GA dealers and suppliers jump on board , with brands like ice maker S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , who distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and store shop@@ keepers who sell approved tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ a is expected to publish further details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment passes through its annual Invest@@ ors &quot; Day . &quot;
&quot; there is much at stake , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in eastern states . &quot;
analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will take twelve months after opening his first markets around five percent of the food market in these two countries and take away all existing players but mainly independent retail@@ er sales .
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retail stores could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and met@@ a 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will start 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA next year , generating sales of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market . &quot;
&quot; the loss in food and food business and amounts to Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost base could cost around 13 million dollars in earnings before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ a gains market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan discovered that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley assumes that Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will decline in the food and food business by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 , and will reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told Melbourne that Met@@ a will probably disappear within a decade . &quot;
he refused to publicly respond to the comment by Mr Dou@@ glass .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ a has made contact with Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ G@@ AS market share has fallen from 18 percent to 14 percent , and income from Met@@ a &apos;s food and food trade , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt with simultaneous pressure on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; the wholes@@ aler , however , resist@@ s and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million in order to align selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products every week and to provide I@@ GA retailers in improving their stores through faster growing fresh foods and to deliver a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging refurb@@ ishment programs to El@@ an will grow and hopes that the wholes@@ aler will return to a profit growth for the first time in four years in 2017 .
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism of his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ gy@@ lis and , according to the president of the Australian tennis association , Steve He@@ aly deserves praise rather than criticism of his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , always referred to as &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the lim@@ eli@@ ght with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka &apos;s not@@ orious confrontation with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati soon after that , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent , R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee . Har@@ rison exc@@ laimed : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have had to beat Kyr@@ gy@@ z , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was finally seen how to beat a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp lifted a potential US Open victory by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glas@@ gow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth in the second place behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi@@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I &apos;m rather en@@ vious about is the fact that in my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the dispute , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi good enough to know he &apos;s not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I believe he was treated a little too severely . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits in the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not take into account Kyr@@ gy@@ z@@ stan &apos;s important preliminary decision , which begins on Friday , and he describes the &quot; joint decision &quot; as the right one for everyone , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term firm component to the team . &quot;
&quot; first , we wish the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ gy@@ z &#93; , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to make him understand the consequences of his actions . some time out of the lim@@ eli@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I consider it appropriate and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees &quot;
Hungary explains the emergency and regulated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos was followed by the border when hundreds of migrants arrested in a No Man &apos;s land , and Ser@@ b officials re@@ acted with indignation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence hid for an unknown time in a strip of land on the road between the two control points of the countries , built tents and settled there . &quot;
but fru@@ strations rose .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; opened the border ! &quot; &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian pro@@ clamation . &quot;
some suffered from protest food and water .
&quot; &quot; &quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it was &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece were arriving . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border came one day after the 28 @-@ year @-@ old bloc with a stringent meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be agreed .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people who were seeking refuge in the crowded Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would eventually receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; Hungary , however , did not put its hopes on a swift action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
the emergency situation in two southern regions on Tuesday gave authorities greater powers to deal with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed asylum procedures .
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire camp along its border to Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants through the country , having ended a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed in the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bott@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and the entry point into the European Union . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban insisted that most of the incoming economic refugees are seeking a better life and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damaging of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 foot ) high fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia is a crime . these laws also establish higher sentences for convic@@ ted human traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government explains the state of emergency , &quot; said spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree to the deployment of the military that is expected next week , but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs already for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security consultant for Or@@ ban , said that authorities 45 people were trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated deeper into the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of the off@@ ence of off@@ ences under the new laws . &quot;
authorities are in the process of quickly re@@ pairing the fence .
Hungarian civil servants also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia on Tuesday morning after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders .
&quot; chaos surrounding the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when the Hung@@ arians opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and pressed a crowd to squee@@ ze themselves there . &quot;
&quot; some 20 managed to get involved , but thousands stayed outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead before Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national pol@@ l hal@@ ved
&quot; former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit advantage in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at a national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent earlier ) while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( increase by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice President Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he candid@@ ates for the presidential office , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the beginning of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determining which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders earned some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a big advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections have decreased . &quot;
&quot; their support among men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders will only be back with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage for democratic voters under 50 years has evapor@@ ated , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a big advantage with older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was in front of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit advantage in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters of the local elections states that they would support Clinton &apos;s enthusiasm when she was nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would support it only because it is the candidate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps it &apos;s not surprising that Clin@@ tons &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about it .
the views are more bl@@ ended with those who currently don &apos;t support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the primary elections say they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Repub@@ lican voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tr@@ ump ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate is the most frequent answer that she has the correct experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; from Clinton &apos;s supporters , her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) is also mentioned . &quot;
consent to deal with the problems and the avail@@ abil@@ ty are also quoted .
&quot; since the vice @-@ president raises a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third thinks he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic voters will be asked for elections , who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the top . &quot;
&quot; of Clinton &apos;s followers , more than half say that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far before S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den does not decide to run for the Democrats &apos; nom@@ ination , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead increases ahead of S@@ anders , from 20 points with bi@@ ds in the race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure decreased by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important in a candidate , the Democratic voters call questions about the elec@@ torate . &quot;
&quot; similarly as in the last month , not a single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ torate elections stands out as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic Can@@ did@@ ates or potential candidates deliver good results in some important features among elec@@ tors of the pre @-@ election of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and equipped with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; with the three candidates , Bi@@ den is best cut off with hon@@ esty , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the leadership . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent have no opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in the prim@@ aries generally see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ideological in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , about a quarter of democratic voters have no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; since questioning H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal email address and a server during the term of office as Minister of Foreign Affairs , most Democratic voters are happy with their statement of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether . &quot;
but it is another story in the American public altogether .
&quot; half of Americans are dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion had worsen@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; it is basically Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered to be honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them among registered voters : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 % of the eligible voters do not hold them to an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of the eligible voters look nationwide Tr@@ ump as not honest and un@@ trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tr@@ ump , however , receive good leadership notes . &quot;
&quot; of the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honest , but as with Car@@ son , many have no opinion of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 demo@@ cra@@ cies in the elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son approaches Donald Tr@@ ump in nationwide surveys
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tr@@ ump on the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times Survey
&quot; the two candidates have meanwhile eliminated half of the voters &quot; support in the new survey , and others lose dramatically . &quot;
Repub@@ lican voters continue to support Tr@@ ump in large numbers across the country . support grows from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey conducted in front of Fox News debate last month to 27 % in the Tuesday survey .
but Car@@ son was in the same period from 6 % to 23 % .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tr@@ ump among repub@@ lican elec@@ tors with higher education .
&quot; with exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio @-@ Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , the rest of the field , with exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is defeated with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 persons of Repub@@ lican elec@@ tors in this latest survey was Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is growing in the poll@@ s - with 19 % support among the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind Tr@@ ump with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tr@@ ump clearly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; looking at a car@@ son rising last week , Tr@@ ump found some side @-@ hang@@ ers for the former neuro@@ surgeon himself , even after Car@@ son made exc@@ uses to ask Tr@@ ump believing . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; Tr@@ ump said last Saturday during a campaign performance in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is presently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are only measured in the distance , there is already a trip to the Mediterranean for bathing holiday@@ makers to find hot water . &quot;
a bath in the North Sea or Baltic Sea should be a rather short amusement at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people don &apos;t go into the sea anymore : at a maximum of 18 degrees , the water in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , bathing temperatures continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east , it can even reach up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic , it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt reaches 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood charged with the death of a Bar@@ uch College no@@ vices
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a regi@@ ous ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were filed against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si br@@ otherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ritual in September 2013 , and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death . &quot;
officials said he had been loaded with blin@@ d@@ folded eyes laden with a 30 pound bag full of sand and repeatedly attacked while trying to go over a frozen field to a goal .
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about headaches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the emergency number 911 after Den@@ g was power@@ less and supposedly killed an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood , to seek advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and presented the well @-@ being of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and the next morning he died of his injuries . &quot;
&quot; following an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , trunk and thi@@ ghs with a bl@@ unt force . &quot;
&quot; too many families have been destroyed by the har@@ ass@@ ment of the Brotherhood . at least one student dies on the har@@ ass@@ ment every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ coun@@ table , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the murder of the third tier for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also accused of de@@ vis@@ ing and forming a criminal organisation . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to blame the persons involved , but if there is an organization that - officially or in@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold it to account , &quot; Wagner said at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has forbidden the Brotherhood , and the National Brotherhood has re@@ vo@@ iced its affili@@ ation with the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; an increase in interest comes , and the domestic trip is falling , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slide into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will last and how long it will last .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first interest rate increase and took 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , although not always , a factor in how the economy and financial systems react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so strongly that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants could find that the whole fuss could possibly be exagger@@ ated because of interest in interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase of F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of cheap money , &quot; &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , Chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a communication to clients . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of U.S. interest rates to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effects . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volatile for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the impact is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there is apparently a tendency that net assets are stran@@ gled 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which might reflect the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest rate increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; in more detail , the market has been in the upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the road to increase interest , rather flat in the 250 days afterwards ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis published by Bob D@@ oll , Head of Plant Strate@@ gies at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ denti@@ ally tend to occur later in the initial cycle and the return is beginning to decrease .
rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life but interest increases often promote them .
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that previously did not exist and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point in the interest rate of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , at the 118 interest rate increases since 1950 , only twice the nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , few expect this to continue and for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed , demand only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; interest rate increases in such fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raises the question &quot; &quot; whether this time is different &quot; , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have prepared an increase in interest of the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC might approve an increase in this session , fut@@ ures trade is only a 25 percent chance . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; in our study , all elev@@ ations between 1950 and today have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ary heights were made very quickly after the start of recovery in the shadows &quot; , &quot; according to the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volatile , as the market anticip@@ ates interest income , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect of bonds is faster than in stocks when they change their strategic course .
&quot; in bonds , the returns seem to change the direction once the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the climb cycle , the bond yields disappear immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b &apos;s strate@@ gi@@ sts believe that the increase in interest rates will cause ren@@ di@@ tes closer together between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds are often contributing to better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , fixed @-@ income analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; it is interesting , however , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline in inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest rates have risen , yield curve has increased , lending margins have widened and volati@@ lity has risen - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tens its strategy . &quot;
&quot; large and large companies , who handle the larger part of their business operations in the United States , will benefit when interest rates are rising and local products become more attractive . &quot;
multinational companies with high debt are getting worse as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debts .
&quot; the story shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively three months after initial interest increase , Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed an average of 5 percentage points after each of the rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debts become a major problem .
&quot; companies with a high proportion of flexible interest rates will lose the most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure stock games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts from different opinions are how quickly this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says Member of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative Member of Parliament critic@@ ised the channel for its &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also went to the BBC Music Awards and said they just im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament @-@ colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins gra@@ bbed the broadcast The Voice , and said this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; &quot; turns &quot; &quot; to Classic FM , says a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like the word &quot; stupid &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards , which started last December . &quot;
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples , in which you actually only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC @-@ General Director rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial competi@@ tor when it comes to live music and education .
&quot; what I learn about Radio 3 , I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else . &quot;
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the engagement of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works is really important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er efforts should be made to engage the audience when it did so in the past , because the British are less informed about classic music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of the BBC production which , during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media and sport , was under fire to tramp@@ le on commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory de@@ pu@@ ties Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins gra@@ bbed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , bought by the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insisted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as Ju@@ dge - was produced in a special BBC mode .
he added that he would like the company to &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; when the next time there was a series of entertainment .
&quot; however , he refused to rule out the order from further series of The Voice in the future , or to spend money from h@@ eli@@ sts for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales increased slow@@ est in August and Black Friday can be responsible for it
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest income since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday slow@@ ed spending in November
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has been dri@@ lled , and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; experts say that there are now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new figures show only seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the records in 2000 with only five percent increase over the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures show only seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , it has always developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , editor of the IM@@ R@@ G sales index to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant more people could buy online and that people could do this in different environments , for example at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this is comm@@ uting , and we will possibly experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing revenues .
experts believe that buyers will retain their purchases prior to this event held last Friday in November .
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer websites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe Black Friday , in which the buyers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could stop buying purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 expenditure was spent on £ 5 online .
&quot; in some products , such as tel@@ ev@@ isions and washing machines , more than one third of shopping is now done via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online instead of fashion labels in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims bury the killed in Mec@@ ca by crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the cor@@ p@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first burial in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia partly lays down the collapse of the huge Saudi Bin Laden Group
the Ministry of Health said that a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed
hundreds of Muslims gathered when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury the massac@@ res that were killed when a crane collap@@ sed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s large mo@@ m .
&quot; gri@@ eving filled , mostly dressed in white , the route to pay their respect when the first of the dead came their last journey to the Renaissance ch@@ urch@@ yard . &quot;
&quot; the procession went past the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane fell through the ceiling of the mos@@ que and then on the ends . &quot;
&quot; the bodies were released for burial , when the Saudi king passed a san@@ ction over the construction company of Bin Laden &apos;s family for the catastrophe , which also left 3@@ 94 injured . &quot;
the bodies of 29 worshi@@ ppers who were killed when a crane fell through the Great Central Moon of Mec@@ ca were carried through the streets .
&quot; among the dead Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram was located in Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage , when the crane stepped in . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officials have already pointed out that the H@@ add@@ sch go on to Mec@@ ca with thousands , who will continue to join the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group , said he should not have let the arm of the crane stand when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arab version of the decree issued by the state Saudi press agency , said the Bin Laden Group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man paid for revealing what caused the fall of the Cran@@ e , which pl@@ ung@@ ed into an inner courtyard of the large mos@@ que , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which took place later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has not issued statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for comment . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also critici@@ zed the group for not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s large mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive construction project led by the Bin Laden Group .
the Bin Laden family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over bigger construction projects .
&quot; the dead leader of Al Qaeda , O@@ sam@@ a bin Laden , was a revol@@ ting son who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; the wre@@ cking of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is necessary at least once in the life of any healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said 158 people remain in the hospital .
government officials arranged that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) were to be paid to the relatives of the killed and the same amount of dur@@ ably injured .
other injured receive half of this amount .

&quot; Brit@@ ons increasingly employ arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled tra@@ des@@ men from Eastern Europe has risen
&quot; in addition , 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at tra@@ des@@ men , will be opened &quot;
&quot; at the same time , King@@ f@@ isher 60 B &amp; Q will close sales outlets nation@@ ally &quot;
&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chef correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is alleged that Br@@ its lay down their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favor of the use of skilled workers of Eastern Europe , who carry out their work in their homes . &quot;
&quot; if you can handle a hammer or a brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority today . &quot;
&quot; the British are increasingly employing tra@@ des@@ men to do DIY jobs in their homes , says the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the hardware chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe that offer services at low prices is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 additional Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , which are aimed at tra@@ des@@ men and to close 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted to employ more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight out of ten buying decisions were made by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households than in the past .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said , &quot; &quot; It still works a majority of men in our branches . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we have to shift this stronger towards a balance . &quot;
&quot; in principle , half of our customers are made up of 80 percent of the decisions about buying articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the top of a UK listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also re@@ structured her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions . &quot;
&quot; king@@ f@@ isher is almost the only company that has exactly 50 percent of the team occupied with women , including its management and CFO . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; this was a deliber@@ ate decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group owed the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; due to the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , who owns Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new branches . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball player A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and public procurement on Wednesday . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was acqu@@ itted legally in May . &quot;
the current trial was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the Federal At@@ tor@@ ney @-@ General Robert Ri@@ ffel , the investigation revealed that in the years 2006 to 2011 , the defend@@ ants used funds from the accounts held in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 Euros . &quot;
the sports officials are also charged with financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact was divided by the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
the defence &apos;s accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity was that no asset was created to the association at any point in time .
&quot; the sports officials would only have charged allowance and the Sport@@ club , for which they had invested a lot of time and money in which they invested a lot of time and money - the liabilities amounted to around 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( about 4@@ 4.000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we faced the situation : do we carry on the club further or lock ourselves ? &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread @-@ based profession of the financial office . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleagues and co @-@ defend@@ ants .
with all risks .
&quot; we have advanced money to secure our life insur@@ ances as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can freely manage the money , no debt can be made . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of a corresponding financial success , compens@@ ations for reimbur@@ sement of expenses were decided retro@@ actively until 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore one part of the allowance was paid only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus has been on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , l@@ ump @-@ sum and not detailed accounting appeared , the former chairman explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and savings books jointly administered the two defend@@ ants , said the second accused . &quot;
the judge asked why the pay@@ outs were not disclosed in detail .
&quot; the association has not been interested in the details of the financial support , it is important only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , an amount of 120@@ ,000 Euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account when investigations were initiated against the one function@@ ary investigation . &quot;
the defend@@ ants accepted that .
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant , and was not known according to the association &apos;s statement . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; for a long time , the respon@@ dent didn &apos;t know any answers . &quot;
then he finally thought that this was the best thing for the club .
&quot; if something had happened to him , no one would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor stated in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary was justified . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was formulated as a &quot; &quot; claim compensation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why in@@ dem@@ n@@ ity ? , they wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant declared that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association never had any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do when the lawyer tells : &quot; &quot; you are all from the tailor . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he simply reck@@ oned mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; on diets , he charged € 1,000 per month , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not able to provide accurate records for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer kept up after an audit , in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also related to the second accused .
&quot; in his statement , he explained in his statement that he had to reti@@ re from his place of residence to the bank to Blei@@ burg . &quot;
the main hearing will continue on 23 September with the questioning of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is covering another 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to staff reductions , which have been ongoing for three years , the computer system will build further jobs when it comes to spl@@ itting up the company . &quot;
the positions at the US @-@ Compu@@ te H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology company plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate client division . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs in the amount of US $ 2.@@ 7@@ bn ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the breaking down of 55@@ ,000 jobs for the past three years has not yet been completed . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the fiscal year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard share rose by 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Califor@@ nian Pal@@ o Alto company , which has grown up with printers , is currently spl@@ itting up : the computer and printer business should be bund@@ led in a new society - separated from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a again dis@@ appo@@ inting PC sales and a weaker demand of corporate customers after its services put the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to Lenovo la@@ stly .
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , PC and printer sales declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
revenues decreased in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP responds by spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions on the changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly purchase smartphones and tablets instead of traditional computers and do more and more business online .
&quot; all in all , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans envis@@ age the reduction of some 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflict : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct involvement of German soldiers in fighting in Iraq would mainly be rejected : 54 per cent opposed it , 35 percent said agreed . &quot;
&quot; the fact that other countries fly aerial attacks against the IS in Iraq and Syria , are 61 percent positive . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; in co @-@ operation with Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of respon@@ dents were rej@@ ecting 20 percent . &quot;
29 per cent could not decide .
car : second press day at 6@@ 6th IA@@ A
&quot; at the centre of the fair , networked , self @-@ prop@@ elled cars as well as electro@@ mobility are at the centre of the fair . &quot;
&quot; after two press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the motto &quot; Mobility bos &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the general public can visit the IA@@ A from Saturday .
&quot; the organizers of the V@@ DA Automobile Association expect about 900@@ ,000 visitors two years ago . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : abor@@ tion in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed to the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and water @-@ th@@ row@@ er against several hundred killed refugees .
&quot; D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ zi@@ k , Euron@@ ews correspon@@ dent , has witnessed the break@@ age of violence at the border control point . &quot;
he reported by phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
after that a police line was formed and a water @-@ light was standing behind the polic@@ emen .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles after the officers . &quot;
the officials firstly continued to use Pep@@ per Spra@@ y .
then the police used tear gas .
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed in the direction of the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now pulled off somewhat .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was carried away from the zone .
children who had inhal@@ ed the tear gas cried .
other refugees came together and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokes@@ persons of the Serbian police also suffered injuries from the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of the decision on interest rates for the Federal Reserve Bank
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US emergency bench comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade interest rates are raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half that the F@@ ed would do this , now thinks that the F@@ ed will pers@@ ist for a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed Inter@@ est put interest on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time we are approaching a situation in which a large central bank possibly leaves the zero area and starts a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , senior employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is on a relatively good level of output , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ru@@ sty outlook on global relations . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
death penalty at Delta State University left excuse
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues later on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could make it happen , &quot; &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi said that Lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; He has fired on someone and killed anyone . &quot; &quot; &quot;
lamb said to the staff of the emergency call that police must send police officers to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but he will &quot; &quot; no one distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller by his name , but he did not give it . &quot;
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; as police entered the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written not@@ z from Lamb , 45 , who said : &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot;
&quot; after writing the quotes , Lamb went 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before finally taking his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen killed him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ For@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , Lamb believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ St@@ een , who said she was married for about seven years , Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ St@@ een said that he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter who was 19 , and she was &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were their daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb have inv@@ oked relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; he is not going to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen picked him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb went to his side , ran on foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. title from the Delta State University , just like his lifestyle on the university &apos;s website . &quot;
stars who lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ standing partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor allegedly had to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly calls for its tribute .
Eu@@ row@@ ings : Lufthansa is building the Group
the Lufthansa plans a large group restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group plans to save half a billion euros in the year alone with a better organisation .
&quot; 150 of the 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , there are new negotiations with the pilot union . &quot;
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and upgrading the cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings image .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment was to generate a profit contribution of some 500 million euros per year resulting from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there is no more board for the passenger business at Lufthansa in future . &quot;
the Eu@@ row@@ ings low @-@ cost airline should be developed as independent as possible .
in future Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt would be responsible for Eu@@ row@@ ings in the Executive Board around chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
&quot; with the new acquisition , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Eu@@ row@@ ings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; until now , the organization of the company &apos;s 120@@ ,000 employees was complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the umbrella of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents a quarter of the annual turnover of EUR 30 billion . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the conflict with the cockpit of the cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to resume after the prosec@@ uted strike on this Thursday . &quot;
that shared the union with .
the theme of the talks should be the retirement control for pilots .
&quot; &quot; in one year , the cockpit hopes to achieve sustainable results as quickly as possible with a forecast result . &quot; &quot;
the conflict between the union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the interim supply of the pilot , the wings are the &quot; Wings . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa moved to the Group &apos;s own cheap Eu@@ row@@ ings cheap line . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
&quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven . &quot;
&quot; while this brought the left external def@@ enders to cry and close him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ruth@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was broken into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated nine minutes on the playing field and needed oxygen before he was taken to hospital .
&quot; said Mr Van Ga@@ al : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated on in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
&quot; in the locker room , he had an oxygen mask . &quot;
he cried .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture then the six months will last , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape from a Red Card and the penalty of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mexican . &quot;
van Ga@@ al suspected that the Italian arbit@@ er had er@@ red .
you can judge for yourself when I say that a penalty meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet to Sha@@ ws &apos;s account was : &quot; thank you all for your messages . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back stronger . &quot;
related to : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
the UK def@@ enders have an additional incentive with the European Championship in France to recover until the coming June .
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player with this kind of injury leaves the place , everyone is very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to viol@@ ate an opponent .
Mor@@ eno had a break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland Team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard because it was not his intention to viol@@ ate the opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball that was in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very badly with it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V @-@ player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to hospital - after a throw from Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it will not take long until you know it by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fair published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss , decided to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Cameron writes in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nice and good , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron is said to describe the plot of the book , instead gives a summary of the movie version of 2012 , adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; as if this were not yet suspect enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so little familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per , who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row to a child . &quot;
a D@@ ow@@ ning Street spokes@@ woman said the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circuit .
&quot; super@@ camps confirm that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s employees , but there were no further immediate comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
&quot; to push to Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ re that England has chosen for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not rule out an out@@ wards victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks site might be less experienced than those three years ago , but there are good spin @-@ players in the Bat@@ ting setting , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not wear s@@ cars from 2012 , just a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali has developed himself as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he represents an unknown magnitude on the test level , an option for the attack . &quot;
this news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the UK @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , difficult to analyze for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; in his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there were no question marks at Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination because - and I have said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , the course of Ly@@ th would have been extended , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further purchases for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even though he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that was not surprising me ; he is above all a team @-@ man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test hit gets to set his character is difficult .
ly@@ th got seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him - while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine .
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and forth .
the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first deployed Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - when Ly@@ th was in top form - but this lost chance is now in the past .
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist that I treasure high . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw early in Yor@@ k@@ shire in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge square , which hit us very much . &quot;
&quot; it must have at least the same opportunities as those before him , but this of course depends on the team position in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to beat Mo@@ een apart from Cook , which would provide an extra Sp@@ in @-@ Bow@@ ler and receive four Qui@@ cks , appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ ander has already shown that he &apos;s a vi@@ cious circle of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een maybe didn &apos;t do his job for his County Vor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he &apos;s a number 3 for her , and there &apos;s no big difference . &quot;
my previous te@@ amm@@ ate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared in 2001 as an op@@ ener .
he made three hundred R@@ uns immediately and didn &apos;t look back .
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may view his stat@@ s - on average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have opted for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England made some clever additions to the train@@ ee staff . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ lah J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the b@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a fe@@ at . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys of the game , who will bring a wealth of experience , as he has played under all conditions and against all attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful deployment into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices in the locker room can bring fresh breeze , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;

&quot; some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;

such decisions are not made easy in heart .
Bre@@ x@@ it stock ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Britain &apos;s exit from the EU ) could gain access if the economy gets into a dol@@ drums by 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s unprecedented re @-@ negotiation strategy to hold Britain in the EU is getting deeper into trouble every day , even without the choice of genius &quot; &quot; Is it Yes or No ? &quot; &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the Leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , which is severely dis@@ appearing on Tuesday because of Europe . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ at friend recently said that some member states are so deeply involved in various crises , such as the EU is now and not always out of their own fault , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive Treaty changes which they usually do not want . &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they end@@ anger social protection .
we could also call it Dave and George Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Minister of Finance are climbing at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , making a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , come home and say that they gain allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s all about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes to look outside Britain outside the EU tent - &quot; L@@ ass us not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and lets us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials came to the point where they don &apos;t care whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her as it happened with the exagger@@ ated long endurance like T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
France &apos;s François Hollande can look back on his re @-@ election or its release in 2017 .
it is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right government , Spain left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they are going to pull a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie British , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want , because most of the similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , some such ministers may deliberately not plan helpful ann@@ ot@@ ations , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign in 2017 to ha@@ sten the Bre@@ x@@ it process , susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ ory the Fle@@ et Street can be at their expense and which EU scep@@ tics were the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the press ar@@ mon@@ wealth , as they did during the 1975 referendum inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; they can be weak in Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ Euro @-@ Opport@@ uni@@ sten , who has made himself a name as a &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed knew polic@@ emen who were his enemies . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ ch@@ opping ali@@ ens and pseu@@ do non @-@ nationals who have most of our large newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought much like she , but found out that when you sit in a cage with a hot gor@@ illa , you get better ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him instead of getting to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; indeed , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ ir himself than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle rejected on the un@@ approved EU constitution which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly ch@@ aps on my back on Monday in Westminster , I told him that he didn &apos;t need any time for me - in danger of repe@@ ating N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 1980s - a mistake back then and now . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s official position on Europe is - I &apos;ll express it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional Bl@@ auf@@ ari@@ b@@ stoff tendency and the wild bo@@ ilers of Tor@@ ey &apos;s Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ness can say yes to that . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , &quot; but no Benn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said when the boy sc@@ outs in him fought not to admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 &apos;s when his old father tried on television to be il@@ loyal to his cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
but to fight to &quot; remain &quot; under all circumstances - Benn@@ inger &apos;s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell told his fellow campaig@@ ners and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening .
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he has even touched me - News discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding site of Par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is right to give Cameron no free ticket to Europe allowing him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks this way .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities about EU membership - in line with their Benn@@ ite Siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric discussion among left dissi@@ dents , for whom the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of small differences is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities about NATO - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to leave , foreign diplom@@ ats are obliged to try to find a sense of their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British if this can be all sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
&quot; the US is already quite disappointed with the weak military performance in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded of on Monday by something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum called . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise public health report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims by a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , some with links to the tobacco industry , researchers said . &quot;
experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) concluded that they critici@@ ze the evidence used by Public Health England ( p@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes .
&quot; he published the &quot; &quot; Basic report &quot; &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et attacked the &quot; extraordinarily win@@ dy foundation &quot; on which he founded his main conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked whether the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on proof of effectiveness . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the alle@@ gation of p@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people conven@@ ed to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( MC@@ DA ) to produce their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were sum@@ mar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously been received by British American Tob@@ acco Products ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed BA@@ T &apos;s references to public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants stated at the meeting to obtain funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he should have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International , they added . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for choosing the members of the committee are not delivered , but several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are included , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the tobacco line was also attended by p@@ he . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ esses &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these links or restrictions are discussed in the p@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said the alle@@ gations of &quot; &quot; there has been no evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes as a way of smoking for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; &quot; were premature . &quot;
&quot; Prof. Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ Being at p@@ he , said that the BM@@ J &apos;s alle@@ gations were already re@@ acted before . &quot;
&quot; he said , &quot; E cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies on his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low in comparison to this , but that we continue to study the long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear obligation to inform the public about what evidence proves and what does not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers compared to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; almost 80@@ ,000 people die every year on a disease related to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds a year . &quot;
&quot; due to the clear presentation of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfil our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ ers , says former boss of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ers and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; &quot; give their right arm &quot; &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcast fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not broadcast by other UK stations .
he critic@@ ised the BBC for making public @-@ legal programmes that are likely to be seen by a smaller audience in a highly controversial tim@@ eline against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C4 .
&quot; after the BBC &apos;s Director , Tony Hall , said that the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he tried to get in touch with the BBC for six years in his time at Channel 4 . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs adverti@@ se or broadcast programs that would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; Johnson said to the Ober@@ haus communications committee as part of his investigation on the BBC &apos;s future . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to keep the broadcast fee , what I don &apos;t think of medium or long term for a good idea , one should at least put its production on programs that others do not do or commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach as much support as possible for their future .
&quot; the idea that no one else would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax is funding programs that could also be funded without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ ers is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; frank@@ ly , other channels would give their right arm for it . &quot;
I try to see how this should be public television .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC is to blame for valu@@ ations &quot; &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the BBC &apos;s most popular programmes give this back what the former director of Sky , Tony Ball , in his Mac@@ Tag@@ gart Conference in Edinburgh in 2003 suggested that the BBC shows how to sell East@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches should go to BB@@ C4 , where fairly the audience can &apos;t measure , but they perform their tasks , and they can argue if they go to their apparent missions to justify 4 billion dollars of radio fees , &quot; &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that nobody has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; to the broadcast fee , Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a more reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value from this . &quot;
&quot; of course , all of us think that for 150 £ per year you get a great value , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to examine its thi@@ thi@@ an mission , &quot; to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of the BBC production would now officially be classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of its TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and it should take an example in &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the issue of part@@ n@@ ering , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like those of the Pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of tel@@ ev@@ isions are shown , and with the commercial broad@@ cast@@ ers to make alliances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells by sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound pulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
&quot; the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are ir@@ radi@@ ated with sound impulses , which have too high frequencies for the human ear to be heard . &quot;
&quot; the impulses are caused by switching on of Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves . &quot;
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ genetics , which can be used ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that releases electrical impulses in the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms usually do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultras@@ onic waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultras@@ onic waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worm cells .
&quot; the sound waves trigger the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically altered the worms so that some of their mot@@ ons carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when applying ultras@@ on@@ ically to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred into the worms , where they turn on the altered mot@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some simil@@ arities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with pulse of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain in an optical fiber , low @-@ frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily vulnerable to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , &quot; he added . &quot;

&quot; important announcement : take the DL@@ R ? &quot; ( Do@@ ck@@ lands Light Railway ) from 15 to 18 September , read in the fon@@ ts of the London Underground and the trademark of the DL@@ R line , which turns into an image of a tank . &quot;

&quot; according to Gav@@ in Grin@@ don , cur@@ ator of Cru@@ e@@ ol designs and lecturer at the University of Es@@ sex , artists become more critical and try to bring political work to the public outside of galleries . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence that ruled around the advertising for the arms trade - through a le@@ asing of the Excel calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ light company advertising , but &quot; the blu@@ eing with bright colours and animation remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they have made a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture equipment at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is a step in the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment will not be illeg@@ ally tra@@ ded on our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for living in student dwell@@ ings
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence , still believing in Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I had anno@@ yed - and the numerous lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residence halls ranges from slightly nerve @-@ wra@@ cking to absolutely sc@@ ary .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to chat : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you are standing in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite do not love nor hate , because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it guides the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you would not speak , even if your lashes were in fire and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people leave .
&quot; people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into beverage formul@@ as , movie night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people dress and put on their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : do not think about starting a university with a relationship
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student dwell@@ ings form a space @-@ to @-@ space bum@@ ble@@ bee culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you must go away so that I get the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel when a student of con@@ vivi@@ ality is exhausted - and send him an SMS instead of kno@@ cking .
&quot; speaking of &quot; &quot; kno@@ cking &quot; &quot; : do it . &quot;
a guy in my student dormit@@ ory had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friendship close by baking .
&quot; since you start the university at the height of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ ck on the doors of people to imagine with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &quot; s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I have baked something . so , and now please smile when I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering home @-@ made goo@@ dies is a good way to make friends .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain and will end up associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; bad mixed l@@ umps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student dwell@@ ings .
&quot; of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea ? &quot;
check that with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say they operate themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; when someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my sympathy - but try to deal with it as my room@@ mate , who added a r@@ ins@@ ing agent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
you should not make any noise that stops people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not just about being a decent person , but that you belong in the tru@@ est sense of the pro@@ verb to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors , if they had anything to make drum &amp; bass qui@@ eter , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more lu@@ ke@@ able music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she let her own music slip , shut down her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse would random@@ ly move into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it wouldn &apos;t be very aw@@ k@@ ward embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future spouse , go to her , go to her again and see her every day and maybe experience how she treats all together friends . &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to persu@@ ade your under@@ body a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment you notice someone has his keys lying in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and mo@@ bbing is more fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good punch is funny , but it only takes moments until he becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place a valuable and am@@ using lesson through hiding - but never store someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which then put you in the freezer - but stap@@ le their possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .
&quot; terra@@ ced houses for refugees , single educ@@ ators , low @-@ wage ear@@ ners &quot;
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds row houses in the middle @-@ Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental Rei@@ h@@ enhaus for people who don &apos;t have much money .
&quot; thus , for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living space , but also the mother and the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; I show you how to build good and good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview &quot;
thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly convenient housing can be created : he is building row houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass housing in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain here for a great part .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a quite ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a row house needs the least space .
it makes integration easier .
this is different if you teach people in blocks of housing .
each of the six houses that are currently being built in the pilot project consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each .
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees will say , it &apos;s peace again , I go back . &quot;
&quot; then , the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their respective needs . &quot;
what are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction took six months .
that is appropriate .
do the building regulations have complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : I have legally drawn up my project .
&quot; especially complicated , it always makes the lo@@ oming dam worth of special construction and the pitch regulation . &quot;
sp@@ oo@@ ky .
&quot; it is still under@@ estimated , who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which definitely is not right .
but do you not ag@@ grav@@ ate the competitive struggle for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true , however : in the last five years we had a building boom in Germany , but we built luxury apartments that hardly could afford any more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the normal people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the mother or the low @-@ ear@@ ner . &quot;
I show you how to build good and good today .
that is why it is all about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setting app , type &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then select &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it &apos;s ready , the phone will give you the option to download and then install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they get an error message indicating that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to avoid the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght return or attempt to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself will guide you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may mean the del@@ e@@ tion of apps to make room - but Apple has made it impro@@ b@@ able by linking the updates . similarly , it will be easier to do this when you use a special tool to delete apps and then re@@ install them once the process is finished . &quot;
&quot; it is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged during the update or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone may switch half way and this could result in a demo@@ lition of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ enberg &apos;s only motto : full attack
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one thing in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against its clearly leading Mercedes te@@ amm@@ ate Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full attack . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the final seven overseas races , the World Cup @-@ II emphasized that I have nothing more to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the runner @-@ up champion before the night race in Singapore on this Sunday from defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
&quot; the Brit@@ on won seven of the twelve races so far , and also attacked the floo@@ d@@ light Grand Prix in the city state as a favorite . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on was able to win the race . &quot;
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will affect Singapore &apos;s Grand Prix is still unclear .
&quot; for days , a ha@@ ze bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island of Sum@@ atra . &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who stayed in Bad Kis@@ singen for more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann is the carrier of the Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz 1st class and honorary citizen of the towns Esp@@ el@@ k@@ amp and L@@ üb@@ be@@ cke .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation which Chairman Alfred Klein received .
&quot; in this way , it is possible to record chess players who cannot open the membership fee . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; youth work and talent research should also be pushed forward . &quot;
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that the membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Red @-@ White &quot; is seen as an expression of his connection with the spa town .
district office seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Centre for the Alten@@ zentrum Anton@@ ella joined the social foundation under the man@@ tle of the social foundation and opened a new point of contact at the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
&quot; in addition to conferences , you can also take part in courses . &quot;
the social foundation pul@@ ls it down from the mountain to the city centre .
&quot; more precisely , the Graf @-@ Stau@@ ff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot;
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; here , immediately next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and advice @-@ seeking information on questions such as the care insurance or the services of the health and nursing allowance . &quot;
for years we have been working with our ambul@@ atory nursing staff that often caring family members are left alone .
there are endless questions .
&quot; not seldom , many of the insurance companies are not utilized because the complexity of insurance companies is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new home manager Jut@@ ta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ cola and the civil hospital as well as for the out@@ patient service Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , you can use additional offers such as prevention prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment . &quot;
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis ideally complement each other .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , precau@@ tion and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
both business leaders see the reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city centre particularly in the demographic change .
because this makes a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg essential in the future .
&quot; in addition , Mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined the inaugur@@ ation celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the agreement at the age : &quot; &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the programme and these invite to a regular soci@@ able gather@@ ings . &quot;
the social foundation thus makes a big contribution to the fact that sen@@ iors can live as independent and well in their familiar environment as possible .
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

Viennese architect Karl M@@ ang died 92 @-@ year old
&quot; Karl M@@ ang , one of the Do@@ y@@ ens of Viennese architecture , is dead . &quot;
&quot; he died on 5 September at the age of 92 , as the Künstler@@ haus announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; with M@@ ang , the Künstler@@ haus will lose a honorary member and at the same time &quot; one of the most important architects of the second half of the 20th century in Vienna , &quot; as it was said in the field . &quot;
&quot; born in Vienna in 1922 , M@@ ang studied architecture at the Technical University of Vienna at Friedrich Leh@@ mann during and after the Second World War . &quot;
&quot; since 1952 he worked as a freelance architect , but also worked as a teacher , writer and institute director . &quot;
&quot; from 1972 to 1983 , he was President of the Austrian Institute of Design . &quot;
&quot; in the 1980s , he was commissioned to furn@@ ish the Treas@@ ury in Vienna &apos;s Hof@@ burg and the conversion of the Lob@@ ko@@ witz Palace to the Austrian Theatre Museum . &quot;

&quot; according to his own statement , he wants to have 30 kilograms of muscle mass in the past two years . &quot;
&quot; intellectu@@ ally , however , he did not assign . &quot;
&quot; Wiese was cut straight the hair in the Bremen city centre , when he saw , as outside a car park guard exhibited a p@@ addle for his white Chevro@@ let Cam@@ aro . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Wiese ran out of the shop , insul@@ ted the be@@ amer and repro@@ ached her with the penalty of fine before the feet , as the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper reported . &quot;
&quot; at the City of Bremen , the accus@@ ations are confirmed , but it is not clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot;

men beat a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an
&quot; witnesses are looking for the police for an incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ or@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 11.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den to Sal@@ or@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ an , according to the police , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at that time the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the gas station grounds .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young people and struck this with their fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al her@@ nia and ble@@ eded strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left off his sacrifice . &quot;
&quot; from his friends , the injured young man was brought home . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator followed the group with a passenger car to their home and demonstr@@ atively passed several times there .
&quot; when one did not see the vehicle anymore , the injured walked in front of the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
&quot; under the help of a stick stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ness , you beat on the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the injured had to be taken to a hospital for medical care .
so far only a vag@@ ue bag description is available .
one of the men was about 1.80 meters large .
the second ra@@ cket was about 1.@@ 65 feet tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police ask witnesses and sign@@ ors to report under the phone number 0@@ 6@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller to take over practice field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 Euro
&quot; Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller , from left to right , assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gen@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; also joint may@@ ors Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased . &quot;
&quot; there are missing doctors in many places in the country - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , is lucky : Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice of Fel@@ gen@@ ausen on October 1 . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still on hand to his successor in the coming months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller will open the practice on 12 October , until that time he will invest 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St@@ .-@@ Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ strasse 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight , when the field offices met Frank Müller and his wife , Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently doing their specialist training in the Order of Malta and wants to enter the practice . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ gen@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was so far , I simply called them . &quot;
the couple Müller liked the idea of running their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss soon . &quot;
&quot; and so they agreed , the rub@@ b@@ ish bought the house with the practice . &quot;
&quot; however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller has also grown up there , his medical studies in Hannover followed in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed chief medical specialist in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is involved in the DR@@ K willingness to work in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice for the new boss will be prepared . &quot;
his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ gen@@ ausen .
&quot; the Müll@@ ers , both Inter@@ ni@@ sts , want to settle down as doctors . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and endurance EC@@ Gs and need a speech room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant amoun@@ ting to a total of 50@@ 000 euros is received by the land@@ fill as part of a funding program of the county ( 25@@ 000 Euros ) , as well as from the joint municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice continues , &quot; says Sam@@ t@@ commun@@ e Mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2,000 patients each quarter come to the practice field breaks , in North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another family doctor &apos;s practice .
a positive side effect of the practical tak@@ eover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel rocky queu@@ es in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor had found himself , she would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; who visits Müll@@ ers speaking hour , inci@@ dentally also still looks above all in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era ends , after all , the doctors have practiced there for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning , we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel said . &quot;
a little melanch@@ oly has already been felt after a long time .
&quot; but we are still living in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will see many patients still often , &quot; says the Intern@@ alist . &quot;
&quot; her husband is laughing : &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter plot . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gar@@ dening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the couple has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we leave the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also passed on to our southern border , &quot; said Interior Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the border controls on the Hungarian border are maintained parallel to this .
&quot; it is still clear that anyone who wants to make an asylum application can do so &quot; &quot; self @-@ evi@@ dently &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the emphasis is on the supply and safety of people .
&quot; but it is also clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people must know that we do not accept border @-@ free migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled procedure .
Croatia is considering &quot; corridor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wanted to leave incoming refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances establish cor@@ rid@@ ors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not see this very much . &quot;
&quot; the idea of cor@@ rid@@ ors is &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy surveillance of the border - especially towards Hungary . &quot;
&quot; the border with Croatia , on the other hand , is already strongly controlled as the outside border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia &apos;s borders for refugees do not want to shut down its borders . &quot;
&quot; each member of the EU must fulfill its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried in the night hours to Tuesday to pass by the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id in eastern Croatia to avoid the registration . &quot;
the c@@ roati@@ an police could pick them up in the nearby maize fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik has been constantly taking police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it is primarily a matter of Syri@@ ans and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in operation .
&quot; in the coming days , his country reck@@ oned with some 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Croatian and Serbian media reported on Wednesday from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border that had previously brought migrants to the Hungarian border . &quot;
&quot; however , the government in Belgrade denied that it was to encourage people to embar@@ k on certain routes : &quot; neither we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the morning a first bus with some 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses were expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
the passengers were on the way through Serbia all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border .
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police told us that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; with this , the predicted shift of the Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could now come to a somewhat further west route . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive border control options &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country had prepared corresponding plans for possible exceptional situations in the case of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
he did not mention details but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member had &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control . &quot;
perform strict controls in order to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been a member of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country since then , regarding the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to the media reports , they had spent the last night at the border crossing of Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
it is still unclear whether the remaining refugees will now travel to the Croatian border .
the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic tried to calm Wednesday early on a local sight in Hor@@ gos : he considers the debates on alternative routes of refugees after the Hungarian border is now closed for premature .
&quot; at the moment , it would not be about very high refugee figures . &quot;
&quot; one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants to - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee aid workers have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
but the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the border area 20 years after the end of the Croatian war there are still un@@ cleared mines .
on Wednesday afternoon the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clean@@ ers was sent to the border region .
stock exchanges : Ukra@@ inians worth $ 30 million
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard about a ring of cy@@ ber criminals who have been accused of having gained insights into even un@@ published financial reports and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the information captured , insi@@ der businesses should have been made in the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a total of over 100 million dollars were launched to investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our borders are ultimately captured , &quot; states the SE@@ C communication . &quot;
&quot; the proceedings against 32 more accused , in this case , continued . &quot;
most of the defend@@ ants are from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators should have acted in both the United States and Eastern Europe .
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ z@@ hilfe Mannheim &quot; &quot; has been in operation for 20 years &quot;

&quot; people carry out their err@@ ands , partly fast steps , partly jo@@ vial . &quot;
they control the two stops of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep track of the city .
&quot; puls@@ ating , pr@@ uri@@ ous life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the midst of four great tables each with the heading &quot; &quot; Before I die .... &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; with this action , the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce has drawn attention to its 20th anniversary and is quite confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical Hos@@ pi@@ ce Help is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and talks like the volunteers .
&quot; while some pass@@ ers @-@ by spontaneously attacks the chal@@ k and &quot; affir@@ m my life , &quot; &quot; can read &quot; with the camper through the USA , &quot; &quot; Stop the war &quot; or &quot; don &apos;t suffer for a long time , &quot; others stay short , read , say sentences like &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; again and again there are little discussions about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on the spot .
&quot; only when I realize that eventually the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; says the director of the Di@@ ak@@ onic work Mannheim , which is the carrier of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public effective action for the 20 year old is good . &quot;
&quot; the fact that not everyone wants to express themselves publicly on the tables is understandable , however , after all , it is a very personal thing . &quot;
&quot; the subject of death and death is still afflicted with tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer , although especially the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has helped to open people . &quot;
an assessment that shares An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid .
the funeral and mourning companion is among the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; confronted by personal experience with the topic , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was looking for volunteers by calling for volunteers , she immediately reported and was involved in the founding in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid belongs to a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - the affected and family members in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in Hos@@ pi@@ z St. Vincent . &quot;
they are all trained carefully .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can handle her job and experiences and experiences .
&quot; I see life from a different perspective , keep it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and non @-@ con@@ fession@@ al .
the financial support of health insurance funds and donations from relatives and associations enables training as well as training and supervision of the funeral and funeral atten@@ d@@ ants .
&quot; every two years , training courses for new employees are offered . &quot;
&quot; the tables presented on Saturday are now exhibited in the house of the Protestant church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the Catholic Church &apos;s house ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; there , too , further personal requests can be recorded on postcards . &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed and financial outlook for 2016 lowered
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ appo@@ inting results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered his prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for cargo services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire some 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre@@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit of 10.@@ 40 $ and 10.@@ 90 $ in the financial year , which ends in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10,@@ 84 $ . &quot;
&quot; despite the increases in prices , the lower prospect will be 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on January 4th , and despite higher increases for bo@@ d@@ wind@@ ling shipments of heavy and large packages , which will be raised from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nevertheless expects the result to be increased compared with the previous year due to lower costs , higher revenues , and growth in online stock . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company &quot; &quot; yields solid income if the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade , are considering . &quot;
&quot; the plans for the holiday occupation were announced a day later than those of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , for example the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million dollars , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share amounted to $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just behind the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , which predicted 12 of Z@@ ack Investment Research analysts . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ ack &apos;s analysts expected $ 12.@@ 23 billion .
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has reported a decline in international priority shipping , which brought sales in its unit Express shipping to stagn@@ ation . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , revenue for bo@@ d@@ ging declined by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger par@@ c@@ els and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher earnings due to higher prices , while earnings declined due to higher labour costs in the freight business . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ market trading , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares sank by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; on its most expected conference in the year , Federal Reserve strateg@@ ist will spend two days this week around a 27 foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide if it is time to raise the body for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; a mur@@ al of the United States is threatening over them at an end of the decorated , two @-@ storey conference hall . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chair@@ woman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues intend to set the economic interests of the nation before all other things .
the Central Bank has a double mandate from Congress : maxim@@ izing US employment and prices here stable .
but since the great recession the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability .
&quot; and this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too narrow to predict . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned by the unprecedented short @-@ term interest rate , since the end of 2008 . &quot;
&quot; although most of the data in the economy show that it is growing solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets might frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to increase this volati@@ lity by raising the interest rate for federal government bonds - and be it only a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they watch , &quot; &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased uncertainty surrounding the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which uns@@ ett@@ les the financial market itself . &quot;
about half of the econom@@ ists recently sur@@ vey@@ ed by Blo@@ om@@ berg have predicted an increase in interest this week .
&quot; the financial markets , however , expect the F@@ ed to wait , with a key indicator that shows only a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a drop in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the strike by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value jumped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or by 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy holds the proposition in this week , said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that time , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest rate would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on a good way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the USA . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , that more economic progress would be necessary , an increase in the rate expected . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slow@@ ed in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate decreased to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and near the level the F@@ ed regards as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly below the target of 2 % of the Central Bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can handle higher interest rates and needs them because of the tension on the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world assembled at the end of last month after China had vali@@ dated its currency .
&quot; in May , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Value rose by more than 16 % below its peak , while investors feared that the Chinese economy would slow down global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , with what the Dow falls now by almost 10 % below the May of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , the market turbul@@ ence affects the complex calculation , when one should increase interest rates . &quot;
&quot; if events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US Federal Reserve . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get a better grip on the effects .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the global economy is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included technically in making decision @-@ making . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed Monetary Authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank in recent years has been enormous .
&quot; in 2013 , the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke believed that the F@@ ed could &quot; close &quot; her monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to monitor not only developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ner , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of transactions on financial market movements that apparently are not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; member of the Federal Open Market Committee , a member of the Federal Open Market Committee , who sets up for an increase in interest , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to reduce its interest rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limiting appreci@@ able effects on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should first place aspects of financial stability in the first place just during a severe crisis such as the collapse of the market in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , former member of the Committee on the Bank of England Inter@@ est Sett@@ lement . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il does not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to fall into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because markets are getting upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed I do not think it should rush ahead of time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market that also sells to the general public .
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car department if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the walks . &quot;
&quot; if the whole grocery makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the kitchen ( good and inexpensive ) in this shop is close to the till@@ s and has different participation options .
what is there : do you need anything - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh produce includes Asian specialties and regional Thai herbs , fruit and more . &quot;
&quot; the meat counter is extensive , as is the fish bar - the staff behind the bar will clean and filter the fish and even cook on request for you . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the shop belongs to the massive freezing compartment . here you will find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ ore , whole du@@ cks , fish , cattle @-@ blood and g@@ all , pig @-@ natural dar@@ ms , fish balls , regional sau@@ sage , commercially prepared food and more . &quot;
&quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide cor@@ rid@@ ors are suitable for trol@@ leys and forkli@@ ft trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
&quot; where it is located : the store is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles , on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe THE Original . &quot;
&quot; parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area , along with other shops and restaurants . &quot;
&quot; even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : little Leben@@ shilfe for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
&quot; to give you a warm welcome , does not go without the commitment of countless volunteers . &quot;
&quot; in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da too , there are quite a number of people supporting un@@ sel@@ fish@@ ly asylum seekers in the city . &quot;
they include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 rounds .
&quot; every Thursday , she does it at the asylum seekers home on the D@@ ill@@ inger Street . &quot;
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite different teaching than at a real school . &quot;
Rio Grande &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric society promotes nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS seeks to inform women in a sho@@ cking way how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck on breasts which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods .
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily calorie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher calorie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should undertake . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports Hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the € 2.3 million expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof may be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn of the gym@@ nasi@@ um at Bern@@ rie@@ der Sport@@ grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : during the most recent joint session the revised construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without major discussions .
&quot; before that , the committee had , among other things , submitted an application for a &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; of the valid development plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception , &quot; it was the permission of a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; according to this , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with a non @-@ central first and roof top &quot; &quot; is to be erected . &quot;
&quot; background of the planning is the intended use of the roof surface for solar systems : &quot; this way , we get together a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; , &quot; again , it was about the v@@ aul@@ ting , which for energy reasons - differently than in the construction plan - should be below 10 degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; a &quot; liberation &quot; was therefore necessary because the construction plan permitted no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; regarding the ti@@ lt - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council generally goes more restric@@ tively with deliver@@ ance moti@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; however , the Turn@@ halle installation is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gym@@ nasi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
some 2.3 million euros are calculated at a cost .
subsidies are expected from school and width sport promotion .
&quot; in the next process step , the building application for the 18 x 36 meters large hall will now be submitted to the Land@@ lord Office . &quot;
P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital moves to Sch@@ on@@ gau
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg hospital is to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is appointed new medical director at the hospital Sch@@ on@@ gau . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees pull from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
&quot; the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the district , the coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß confirmed this . &quot;
&quot; however , a decision on this will meet the Supervisory Board , and the Supervisory Board conven@@ es on Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; if the plans were to be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would continue to work at the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital . &quot;
the vast majority should move with Fischer and the further existing In@@ ner station to Sch@@ on@@ gau .
the rooms are present .
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , employees who do not travel to Sch@@ on@@ gau will be offered a job in Wei@@ l@@ heim . &quot;
the employees were informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the termination of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer clinic since the beginning of the year and is now transferred to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came to the game , who agreed to take the lead from October 1 and to switch to Sch@@ on@@ gau with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ on@@ gau , this signi@@ fies in every case a &quot; appreciation &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the &quot; Internal Medicine , &quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ on@@ gau ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the In@@ ner ward .
&quot; for the next two years Fischer and his team , if the Supervisory Board agrees to agree , will lead both houses until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ies , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the district had planned to do so in 2018 , when the current rehabilitation near the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is completed . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met with rum@@ ours that the house , which is owned by the Federal Government , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; I exclude it . &quot; as with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say that there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; at present , a short @-@ term care for Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ry are housed there . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; says Fischer on the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , who had been &quot; &quot; positive and very symp@@ a@@ thetic &quot; &quot; by the employees . &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , where Fischer has been working as a chief doctor for over 30 years , has not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer colleagues to take over the position of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) was threatened repeatedly in the last decades , det@@ ach@@ ments were closed , for example the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Lion are demanded tonight ( 20.@@ 15 h ) at Berg@@ ischer HC .
&quot; the table leader of the Bundes@@ liga is indeed the clear favourite in Wuppertal , but there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the Bad@@ ener at Bh@@ c had a painful defeat and got something good there . &quot;
Jag@@ ha@@ zy with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in action , as the police divided . &quot;
&quot; after firing a shot , a man of 63 and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
how exactly it could come to the accident was not clear at first .
the criminal police determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the cor@@ pse of 16 @-@ year @-@ olds from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who have been missing since Saturday .
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their cor@@ pse cast into a se@@ wer in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing since Saturday , fell victim to a crime of violence . &quot;
&quot; the body of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , including prosec@@ utor &apos;s office and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old celebrated on Tuesday evening is also suspected of having admitted the statement and led the investig@@ ators to the discovery site of the body . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been reported missing on Sunday morning after she had not come home after a visit to a fall festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of an autumn festival .
&quot; in search of the young woman , investig@@ ators first encountered personal objects of the victim . &quot;
&quot; in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquaint@@ ances of the missing persons , there was a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the body was found .
&quot; according to the authorities , the det@@ ain@@ ee admitted to the police interro@@ gation that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was killed and the cor@@ pse was placed in the canal . &quot;
the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was supposed to be brought to the port fun@@ nel on Wednesday ; the investig@@ ators put him to death .
the further investigations are to shed light on the close circumstances of the act .
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing gap
the situation in the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are seeking a affordable stay .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles in the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with incoming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built every year by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this results in a study commissioned by the &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er Wohn@@ bau &quot; &quot; Association of Associ@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; for comparison : in Germany , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished this year . &quot;
&quot; in total , 140@@ ,000 dwell@@ ings are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer obliged to live as asylum seekers in a first @-@ day accommodation . &quot;
many then stum@@ ble onto the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers lived in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to rising refugee figures . &quot;
the study also accounts for significant om@@ is@@ sions in residential construction policy in recent years .
&quot; Germany is shooting a lack of housing , which gets bigger from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently some 77@@ ,000 residential units were missing in the con@@ ur@@ b@@ ations , Matthias Günther compla@@ ins , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in large @-@ scale cities in flat @-@ room flats .
&quot; because of the dol@@ drums on the housing market , young adults remained un@@ willingly in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; last longer . &quot;
&quot; in the big cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in the past few years has been declining for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the &quot; social housing construction &quot; alliance suggests a new start . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should revi@@ ve social housing construction again . &quot;
&quot; thus , the purchase tax could be wai@@ ved and the land tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats may be suspended . &quot;
&quot; moreover , according to the alliance , attractive tax write @-@ off options are necessary . &quot;
the subsi@@ dy programme for refugee shel@@ ters from the state bank Kf@@ W already works well in cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available around 300 million euros had already been found on Monday evening . &quot;
now the project could be increased .
refugees have free jurisdiction : Croatia and Slovenia align corridor
&quot; there is practically no transit to Hungary , as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb is announ@@ cing that the transit through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les to be granted .
but the route is dangerous nevertheless .
Croatia plans to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a cor@@ rid@@ ors for refugees .
&quot; I spoke to the Sloven@@ ian Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; said Croatian Interior Minister , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU @-@ Land of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the death of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to depart from there to Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have crossed the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports Croatian television broad@@ caster RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the day before .
&quot; moreover , new laws , which came into force on the same day , virtually obvi@@ ate the need for asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; the Croatian Prime Minister , Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic , said : &quot; &quot; they can travel through , and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there were people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at the border of Serbia on the EU neighbouring country in the morning .
&quot; most of the media reports are from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came both by bus and with taxis to the Serbian border town of S@@ id .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not meet the border fence . &quot;
&quot; for this , the border strip contains other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clear@@ ers are now to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; however , after the closure of the border , there are hardly any more refugees coming to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 people who had been attacked . &quot;
shortly before the closure on Monday it was still 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws ampli@@ fy the overcoming and damage of the border dispute as a crime .
therefore 35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the south @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted threaten prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the newly established &quot; &quot; Tran@@ sit &quot; &quot; border , of which almost all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
there are 13 families with small children and two elderly people among the applicants .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees would have stayed there . &quot;
&quot; in practice , however , no one has any prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be de@@ ported there .
only a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; transit zone &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke .
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up with it . &quot;
they collected the garbage that tens of thousands of people left on the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barriers have been disman@@ tled and one of the recording bearings in the border area has been reconstructed .
nobody wanted to comment on the purpose of this conversion .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria reaches only a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; but about 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government figures . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the continuation of the journey to Germany . &quot;
the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; after the bridge firm on Sunday we were busy with the clearing , when suddenly ten people with travel agents stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; says mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted to train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; but because Germany had surprisingly adjusted the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s end , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the border with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the Na@@ he Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we had once cal@@ med off the unexpected guests , with snacks and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man did not let himself be given a generous donation - 100 euros for the fire bri@@ gade .
&quot; we were very pleased , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening , the stra@@ ined train passengers had switched from an ICE train to a regional train in direction of Passa@@ u in order to try the railway traffic to Germany after the short notice that the railway traffic was shut down , but still over the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was par@@ ked at the Inn in W@@ ern@@ stein on the edge of the river Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Brü@@ cken@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , tags previously a two @-@ b@@ lower course spor@@ tly - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án is now sending thousands of tens of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke in the camp immediately when constructing structures that ensure human@@ eness , our Federal Chancellor has officially and publicly moved the Hungarian government &apos;s stance to the ha@@ ze of National Socialism . &quot;
the leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic states in the border regions .
&quot; the refugees will also have to realize that the &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; in view of the ongoing refugee streams and the approaching winter , there will be a major challenge in creating decent conditions for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter @-@ solid quarters &quot;
&quot; with the help of refugees , Konrad has to do all his hands full . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen Bank to set up quarters for the thousands of refugees .
&quot; the chaos at the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen opening centre , Konrad , has already managed to get a grip on . &quot;
&quot; we have no more homeless in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported from his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees who had come to Austria on Monday was without a fuss , &quot; &quot; said Konrad and praised the organizational &quot; &quot; masterpiece &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total , Konrad expects a demand of 85@@ ,000 districts in the he@@ ur@@ ish year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 properties have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 are to provide the countries , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the tri@@ bun@@ als .
&quot; they would have assured him , too , to create quarters for the coming refugees . &quot;
&quot; things are going well in Upper Austria , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF action &quot; &quot; Hel@@ ps as we . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is hoped for hotels that are vac@@ ant in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of need , it cannot be that Qu@@ arti@@ er@@ ors have to maintain a certain height of the towel holder or size of the overhead lights . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Interior Ministry , in contrast to the accommodation ministry , Konrad justified his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asi@@ veness is its most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not cause the Republic any cost , as they declared themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
&quot; up to now , the own quest for quot@@ as has not yet been successful . &quot;
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
&quot; however , there are apparently problems with permission . &quot;
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; for the time being , no opening of municipal sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ Arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the persons concerned currently cannot be accommod@@ ated without these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of an emergency , however , further locations are to be tested for their suit@@ ability . &quot;
criticism of the city chief at the partition of the refugees inside the federal state .
other districts must also make their contribution .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
&quot; in a long telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Landes@@ haupt@@ mann Josef P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger ( VP ) has acc@@ eded further action on the refugee issue on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed .
the transfer of refugees to the Federal Republic is still possible .
&quot; however , there are now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees in Germany will no longer be available . &quot;
&quot; the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger once again called for greater solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; the fact that Austria is now taking control of its borders is a logical consequence for P@@ ü@@ hr@@ inger &quot; &quot; a logical consequence &quot; &quot; from the actions of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a question of time
the general renovation of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer Industrie@@ gebiet is officially closed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology area . &quot;
&quot; in IT , smart minds are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
&quot; he could imagine investing in Star@@ tup companies of the New Wer@@ ft , and later on which to acquire . &quot;
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbors - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; EUR 1.7 million were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3,@@ 3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one @-@ third of the city of Linz , the Land of Upper Austria and the Con@@ federation ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building has been le@@ ased by the Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T and Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ owner opened second store in the Arctic
the focus is on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags in the new shop .
&quot; actually , Jut@@ ta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the do@@ ve market ar@@ cade : after all , it now has an increase in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags of the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are available from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks have been changed . &quot;
&quot; but I have long thought about whether I should open a shop , &quot; Br@@ eit says . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was that the Vene@@ to producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of their own location on which only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz Europe who sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters who themselves have Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has been given birth from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I feel the most when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why some woman in a hand@@ bag look like a hand@@ bag , the professional woman can &apos;t answer with last certainty . &quot;
perhaps it is because a nice bag is re@@ used every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tr@@ ump came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
&quot; some people also associate this property with billi@@ on@@ aire , who wants to become US president . &quot;
Donald Tr@@ ump ( 69 ) is always good for any set @-@ off .
&quot; whether he expresses himself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia , concerns journalists or reveals gaps in knowledge in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office promotes the campaign vigor@@ ously . &quot;
and cuts off well .
&quot; this is also recorded in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate million@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the hair@@ pin is a word for many in the wine village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ village is related over -@@ zig @-@ corners with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tr@@ ump , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the act@@ ress Sim@@ one Wen@@ del turned a film about Tr@@ ump .
and what do the villa@@ gers think of being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that somehow exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed by their c@@ all@@ ery nature , &quot; says Sim@@ one Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native city of Kiel made an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous children , including Tr@@ ump and the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ump , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also comes to word in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would surely be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; although there is respect for the family &apos;s performance , it also tends to argue that Tr@@ ump &quot; is already a bit a big mau@@ l , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; accidentally loud the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - to High German : the investors , she says . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is coming from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tr@@ ump &apos;@@ sche success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and in the USA opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers .
the foundation stone of the real estate company was the first real estate purchase in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland for a long time failed in the Bavarian state , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was part of that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tr@@ ump because he was once cut off without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared a movie start . &quot;
Tr@@ ump is the grand@@ son of an illegal emig@@ rant .
this contrasts with the sometimes striking testim@@ onies of the descendants .
it had repeatedly mat@@ ured over Mexican immigrants in the US and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the pole , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative of Tr@@ ump ( &quot; The grand@@ ma was a born Tr@@ ump , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the v@@ int@@ ner in retirement doesn &apos;t see the American rather dist@@ anced , &quot; he is always so four thousand . &quot;
does he think Tr@@ ump is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 year old . &quot;
&quot; he never took care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
the pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like many K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family during a visit ended something for the church organ which was generally well anchored .
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not win the election because &quot; &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ ws at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ t@@ aut Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as President ?
&quot; my President is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe even without the pres@@ idents Tr@@ ump . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , for which Tr@@ ump has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , has seen 12@@ ,000 movie stars . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian town Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the Vice @-@ President at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants of the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park won the award for soft tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain climbing villages . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; must have at most 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership in today &apos;s show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report in connection with the loss of leadership of the liber@@ als , but there have been no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews . &quot;
the N@@ ine breakfast show was aired by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull managed to overthrow Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the present@@ ers David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television programs including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this down@@ side of the resistance seemed to play a role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise scored an average of 39@@ 7.@@ 000 viewers in the five major cities compared to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today announced a slight increase in ratings for mon@@ day ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its figure la@@ gged behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed in recent months .
&quot; in August , today , with an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison with the 3@@ 30,000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40.000 and 50,000 was completed . &quot;
&quot; Sun@@ rise has been at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in today with an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators up to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in September . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change concern this morning people more than the Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former ser@@ ge@@ ant of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive figure of 1.@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could carry a hit show solo without the ra@@ fters star Rebe@@ cca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of yesterday evening answered this with a clear &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X Factor of Seven stayed strong with 1,@@ 136 million viewers and easily hit The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26.@@ 000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ 6.000 visitors on average . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire &apos;s Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia scored 5@@ 20,000 people and in the second half hour was 7@@ 20,000 . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline at the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will be confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 17 : 30 .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ run the Mc@@ Gu@@ ire show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
secrets revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons @-@ Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki have probably unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
the woman at which Sam Wood finally lands in The Bachelor was envel@@ oped in greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows a day before three two , you may have in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently given a hint of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women were ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they would like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , when the question is asked , &quot; &quot; If not you , who should W@@ oods &apos;s last rose ? &quot; , &quot; her answers could become a game @-@ destro@@ yer , who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; Je@@ wel@@ s Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki called them both fast , except themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood . &quot;
&quot; from the first day on , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other . &quot;
&quot; from the moment I went to the house and noticed S@@ ams energies , I felt that they were fairly compatible and I thought it all over the course of the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be together with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I saw them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay thinks she and Sam Wood were well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay told her that the house visit made her clear last week that Wood &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; once I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally att@@ un@@ ed to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; when asked whom Wood was to choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zzling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it is a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broad@@ cast@@ ed on 10 on Wednesday , 7 : 30 PM . &quot;
originally released as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams who sent requests for his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game on the bench when he lost a fight like the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League conver@@ sions at his first Pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his man and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies prior to the rest of the team by the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a also strengthened Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers sports re@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special teams coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey who advised him to forget his p@@ itt@@ y catch , and to take care of the next game . &quot;
&quot; Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at Pun@@ t , which was restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings &quot;
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian follow@@ er had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian Radio Duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he could not imagine a bad start to his N@@ FL &apos;s career .
&quot; that was a thing that happens , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 when a passport in his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
&quot; overall , it was nevertheless a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

&quot; because of the high refugee figures , Free voters call for the setting up of 1,000 new teachers in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the F@@ W autumn fair in Groß@@ stadt , leader of the party and group leader , Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned against a severe crisis at Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; we need at least 1,000 extra teachers to keep schools from collapse , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get distor@@ tions in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Sunday fraction of the Free vot@@ er conven@@ es until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
&quot; actually , entirely different main topics were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees is now dominated by the free elec@@ torate meeting .
&quot; of course , the issue of asylum will over@@ lay the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN Prot@@ ected Are@@ as for Refu@@ ge@@ es in Syria .
&quot; so it &apos;s not going on , we have to look at the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free vot@@ er . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to push the free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore Ai@@ wan@@ ger demanded more staff for the administrative courts responsible for asylum claims : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum judges , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W boss critic@@ ised that several states were not consistent : &quot; we need uniform standards in federal states throughout Germany . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria doesn &apos;t push , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we need to become more capable of action . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the state policy in the city of Wielkopolska should not fall under the table . &quot;
a long @-@ standing torch remains on the agenda : the educational policy .
&quot; for the new school year , the Minister of Education Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) launched the pilot trial &quot; &quot; Medium @-@ level plus &quot; , &quot; which will test an extension of the grammar school of three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the theme of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all the high schools we want .
&quot; free travel at G@@ 9 everywhere , where it is desired . &quot;
tigh@@ tened Wall Street helps Da@@ x to jumps on the jumps
&quot; the German stock market , following an over @-@ long period , has closed trend @-@ less and nervous trading history with profits . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon saw a fir@@ mer pr@@ elu@@ de to the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the Da@@ x by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized values won 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
&quot; the technology @-@ elastic Tec@@ Da@@ x rose by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6,@@ 69 points . &quot;
&quot; the Euro Sto@@ xx 50 as the Eurozone &apos;s index of credit declined by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid profits also boo@@ sted business areas in London and Paris .
&quot; in the US , the Dow Jones Index recently noted some 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
many stock markets anticipate that markets will be replaced until after the interest rate decision in the United States and for the large decline on the date markets on this Friday .
&quot; in the meantime , the debate on the charges from the nuclear phase has pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and also leave deep marks on E@@ on . &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies might be missing 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the German government did not deny the figures stated in the press .
&quot; the shares of the two largest German energy companies then recovered slightly , but in the end they always lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; at Da@@ x , Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to a dealer , a positive report by the U.S. investor magazine &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; came after the weekend . &quot;
so investors gave too little attention to the German chip@@ maker .
the investments in future @-@ oriented waf@@ er technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid .
&quot; car values were in demand : even in the traditionally weak summer month of August , more cars were sold off than in the same period last year , as the industry association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IA@@ A in Frankfurt . &quot;
the documents of Daimler and BMW high@@ ways increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen assets increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
return on the German pensions market fell to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent on the German pension market .
&quot; pension index Rex rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9,@@ 55 points . &quot;
the Con@@ federation @-@ Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
&quot; in the afternoon , the course of the euro fell to 1,@@ 12@@ 62 dollars . &quot;
&quot; at noon , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1.@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1.@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
4 people killed after polic@@ emen shoot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in the southern Nepal after the police fired rubber bul@@ lets into a crowd demonstrating against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the district of Rup@@ an@@ deh@@ i , about 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , senior district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then fired into the air before returning to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were wounded , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber bul@@ lets used , of which it is known that they can kill , but which are traditionally used as a less fatal alternative , apparently have produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the debate was the last in weeks of violent protest in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces formed under the proposed new constitution would reduce their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the T@@ har@@ us who want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , were killed in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed in August when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial issue in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on the way since 2008 , but the legis@@ lators have accelerated the process following the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legis@@ lators have voted this week for certain cl@@ auses in the Constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the plot at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 @-@ square @-@ square @-@ area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commercial and housing is planned , but there are no concrete offers . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to market an area of approximately 4000 square meters in direct proximity to the youth centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are ongoing .
&quot; it is planned to use the grounds for a mix of trade , commercial and housing . &quot;
&quot; you wait for suitable offers , that is to say , on the part of the city . &quot;
what investor inqu@@ ires may not be clear yet .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located on the Boulevard / corner Great Road , bought already a few months ago and the buildings located on it can be torn off . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the plans for the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor presented publicly plans for the project for the first time .
many residents are still worried - they fear the res@@ ale of their leisure district
&quot; for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , plan@@ ed , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday cottage settlement at the small sea close to Em@@ den are lying on the table .
&quot; the stakeholders , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ de Company &quot; System @-@ Building , &quot; unveiled its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council &apos;s urban development committee . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP group , who repro@@ ached the investors and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ ende walked away from the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet answered all questions , &quot; he said in front of the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all the rum@@ ours now .
the roughly ten to twelve million euro projects have been in the discussion for months .
&quot; violent reactions among sea @-@ owners who had come to the meeting , sum@@ mon@@ ed the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , the owner of the sea , and a member of the board of directors of the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; this is a giant leap that over@@ looks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like a number of other project critics that the traffic will increase greatly due to the intended size of the system : &quot; &quot; there must be entire bus invitations so that that pays off , &quot; &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what is happening on the well one hect@@ are site of the former restaurant , however , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Ple@@ ven ends . &quot;
&quot; because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable . &quot;
twin @-@ offspring at gor@@ illas at the Frankfurt Zoo
the Frankfurt Zoo is looking forward to offspring with his gor@@ illas .

Google launches campaign to raise $ 11 million for refugees
&quot; Google Inc ( GO@@ O@@ GL . O ) announced a donation campaign to raise $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees run over the European nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an unusual personal approach to announ@@ cing the Don@@ ations Call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled to Kab@@ ul with her family when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark rail and bus cru@@ ises , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but as the refugee and refugee crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four non @-@ profit organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first globally collected donations will be doubled to $ 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / er@@ eli@@ ef to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many fled from the Afghanistan , Yemen , Iraq and Libya devast@@ ated by the war . &quot;

&quot; for overweight diabe@@ tics , weight loss surgery can be helpful . &quot;
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes may last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell whether easily overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those receiving non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; mortality data takes a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery study . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or obesity surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to eat food .
&quot; over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient for the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in people who are mor@@ bi@@ ologically obes@@ e with a Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 , comparing two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c shr@@ ink@@ age - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were easily overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I among those undergoing this surgery fell from 31 to 24@@ ,5 until the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those undergoing surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes was completely dissolved and 28 % were partial . &quot;
&quot; compared to diabetes , in the medi@@ cally treated group , diabetes dropped by only one percent and partially at only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results concerning blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; L@@ DL cholesterol in general were better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the blood glucose levels of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent and write the researchers .
&quot; after the operation , the average ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in fell from around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at around 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not reduce mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) compared to the Gast@@ ro@@ phy group ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show a survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of more serious people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was about 29 percent less likely to die in obes@@ e people , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study has no benefit for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it is soothing to persons with a BM@@ I under 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we wait too long until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes , which have firmly attached their bodies to obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a topic that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ ghtly , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could set up a literary monument to her home town .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to the violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama addressed the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten day visit to the United Kingdom during his speech at the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford which is dedicated to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the reaction of the West European countries to the refugee crisis was ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation was not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama eng@@ ages Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he emphas@@ ised that it is only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; taking care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as true peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries . &quot; &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we need to reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and also commented on George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US pulled a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he set up violence , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four@@ fold increase of intake of disinf@@ ect@@ ant by children in the last 4 years
&quot; po@@ ison@@ ous control centers in the USA report about an almost 400 per cent increase in the number of children under twelve years of age , which swal@@ lowed strong alcoholic hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants , the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , cases of revenues from disinf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , the poison control centers report , from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them lands in the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children pur@@ pos@@ ely drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mutation in the social media .
videos on YouTube indicate how te@@ ens drink disinf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
te@@ ens re@@ port@@ edly mixed disinf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of disinf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think that this is bad for it , &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; disinf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent are very attractive for children . &quot;
disinf@@ ect@@ ants contain somewhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially in small children , very few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol pois@@ oning . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Thor@@ n@@ ton , medical director of the po@@ ison@@ ous emergency center in the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in K@@ ansa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let down any si@@ p whis@@ ky , but people leave this hand @-@ disinf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and when children come to it , then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who had recently taken four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry du@@ bbing disinf@@ ect@@ ant in the school , was brought to an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally deemed drunk by an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a emergency medical doctor who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ tet medical center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah l@@ utes her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors super@@ v@@ aded them overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital on signs of brain trauma , as the girl had fallen by the alcohol and had pushed his head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; this was very sc@@ ary , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or disinf@@ ect@@ ants and to store disinf@@ ect@@ ants outside of the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; in addition to alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some disinf@@ ect@@ ants were connected with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario have died after the swal@@ lowing of disinf@@ ect@@ ants containing toxic , un@@ declared ingredients . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the state of New York were planning to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to disinf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes it from her room .
&quot; the police looked at the disgu@@ ised plan as &quot; &quot; talk &quot; &quot; and showed disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; during a rear @-@ end collision , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver was slightly injured during a rear @-@ end collision . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver travelled in the direction of the industrial area on the cross @-@ road and noticed too late that two vehicles ahead of the round@@ about had stopped at the round@@ about .
&quot; as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ torium with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a previously standing Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; there was a damage of about 10,000 euros to the vehicles involved in the accident involved , the police reported . &quot;
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be tow@@ ed .

Adam Ro@@ on@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time gave up Aber@@ deen a tight victory over Hamilton in Pit@@ to@@ dri@@ e so that the d@@ ons create a five @-@ point gap between themselves and Celtic .
Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glas@@ gow , which was immediately rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insisted that he and his team mates were not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we &apos;ll feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
lack of title competition in Scottish football boring Dutch - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; said de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they do not show any highlights of the Celtic games anymore and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here don &apos;t just talk about the return of R@@ angers .
they talk about the Old Fir@@ m .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Fir@@ m games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic has to fight , but the Norwegian boss sw@@ ings to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against 10 men from Aber@@ deen followed , which are now clearly at the top of the table with five points ahead . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very fru@@ str@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happened . &quot;
we feel it just like that - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the Celtic support , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ tious with January @-@ transfers
&quot; despite his comments just a few weeks ago indicating that he split a number of January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious about signing new arri@@ vals and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x squ@@ ad . &quot;
&quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no team that has won everything , in poker games or le@@ agues , the games of that kind won &apos;t win . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the United Kingdom it increases overall . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 during the period from May to July , while the number of people without work for the UK as a whole increased by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the figure of 5.5 percent , as shown by the figures of the Office for National Statisti@@ cs ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the State Secretary for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundations for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland made the historic decision to remain a part of the United Kingdom .
in these 12 months we have seen further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a drop in unemployment .

why I Will Be Wit@@ ness to a Exec@@ ution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later , except for a late legal intervention , I shall see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it won &apos;t happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ sy is executed by the poison inj@@ ector . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation already took place for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew near , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the US , and as many more applications are available as seats there is a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery to decide who will be elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
those who are chosen will observe it emotion@@ less .
I can &apos;t do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ sy &apos;s closest friend with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with phone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I can &apos;t be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a bl@@ amed me on Twitter to give up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she acknowledged that she &quot; could have been better form@@ ulate , &quot; but she still thinks that it is wrong what I am doing . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ s@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses anytime .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations work against the death penalty will help . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to enter all details here again .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ sy is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that a strong lik@@ el@@ ihood is that he is not guilty of murder .
I am sure there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I think his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters available to you .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die an unnecessary death .
man after wet police chase persu@@ ades to come out of the C@@ anning River
the C@@ anning V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he talked about the man from the C@@ anning River .
&quot; an attempt by a man of Per@@ th to leave the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few yards away from a police officer trying to &quot; &quot; gently persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the police of C@@ anning V@@ ale was sum@@ mon@@ ed to a domestic peace incident in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of C@@ anning River . &quot;
but he didn &apos;t come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me &apos; , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c wasn &apos;t too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned on a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman acts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
Championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , c@@ ous@@ ins ro@@ de his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the hum@@ orous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ ins bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards were trying to spy on him and threat@@ ens to finish racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at the ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they performed a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching by Lady Tat@@ ai for a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy told Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cobal@@ t @-@ up@@ be@@ fitting in Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had kept back 18 months because of the es@@ pion@@ age alle@@ gations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat down for a long time , but sometimes you are so fru@@ strated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it continued .
&quot; sometimes you respond and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I have said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk up@@ lifted head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; if they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be a trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy on his st@@ ables .
&quot; eighte@@ en months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I would call when I was asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .@@ com. &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if this is the case , they should certainly touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to hold me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of the R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of the R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this make me think that it will be personally ?
has the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what &apos;s going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people think outside that I am .
&quot; maybe they need to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they are thinking about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have now arrived at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that really makes me sad .
I will put pressure on them and press them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer have been built up with the long @-@ lasting cobal@@ t study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation of the un@@ but@@ tered master Black Ca@@ vi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the hor@@ sem@@ an , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I must take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my fellow workers mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been so yesterday evening .
it could have been the same yesterday all day long as it was .
but it also had it on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this issue was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you go too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested for driver &apos;s flight
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and subsequent driver &apos;s flight in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with the helicopter to the Royal Melbourne hospital with severe injuries after being hit by a car on Saturday morning on the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia took part in the police at Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
he is expected to be charged with driver cur@@ ses and lower assistance and other transport off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ram , remains in the hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring fighting
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kl@@ ing of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favour@@ ites of the N@@ R@@ L .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the storm players &quot; ring fights &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in the qualifying final in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne Benn@@ ett made a very disgu@@ ised remark about the Storm team after his team reached the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; model example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League , and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the rings . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , Bell@@ amy champi@@ oned the T@@ ack@@ li@@ g of his crew and said that she only concentrated on her &quot; &quot; contact &quot; &quot; at Tac@@ kl@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers of his team would be confident that they were worried about being beaten by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this always appears again and again - I haven &apos;t heard Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about Ring@@ fights when they beat us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we haven &apos;t changed our def@@ en@@ sive system or techniques throughout the year . but in the last six weeks we made our contact with tac@@ kles a real center of gravity , and this has provided the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years , and he obviously has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not getting used to losing it , so it was a bit of a shock for him . &quot;
it &apos;s funny how this re@@ appears every time at this time of the year .
&quot; Bell@@ amy has attacked Benn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; &quot; exciting football &quot; &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that Benn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the premi@@ er league in 2010 with &quot; &quot; boring &quot; &quot; football . &quot;
Wa@@ yne is talking about exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our on Friday evening and how exciting their game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he &apos;ll take care of a bull@@ sh@@ it . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this . &quot;
I build stronger trust because they say these things because they are a bit worried about having to play against us .
&quot; six weeks ago , they didn &apos;t think of us when it came to big games . &quot;
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm played a higher score against R@@ oo@@ sters than the play Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the play of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t watched it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two further attempts in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are there breaks and no points a bit more exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game plans .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
the Storm team released this weekend as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the pre @-@ final at A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning .
&quot; Ser@@ bians with $ 200,000 deposit on drug delivery &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly threaten a life @-@ long sentence for his attempt to return to the possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men arrested last month after the German police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and in August put in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed , as he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later at Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life @-@ threatening punishment for an attempt to own a commercial quantity of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to possess the entire amount and that in the café could have been for a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ ag@@ an , was concerned about the risk of escape from Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; he said to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal matter , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a deposit of $ 200,000 as security together to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two people , it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ ag@@ an . &quot;
&quot; but that alone won &apos;t be enough to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released on b@@ ail , under the conditions that he ab@@ dic@@ ates his Australian and Serbian pass , reports daily with the police and is holding a cur@@ few from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident at A@@ 5 in Karlsruhe : cab pul@@ ls apart
&quot; during a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the highway 5 near Karlsruhe , a lor@@ ry driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three trucks involved had stopped in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to escape the last moment to the left , as the police divided . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab is completely torn apart .
the driver was severely injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed over six hours until 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; a damage was incurred in the amount of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used telephone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send pictures
a ped@@ ophil@@ er used the phone of a 11 year old girl to claim pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when she fell asleep and logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
&quot; she saw it , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ er@@ ted her mother immediately . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and looked at the five images , then analyzed computers that were found under the address and discovered &quot; relevant &quot; web resear@@ ches that used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he had done it , as it would lead to &quot; ped@@ ophi@@ lia on the Internet , &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ded to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on said the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be a addiction - that he was hoo@@ ked to sc@@ are people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but he said it had happened because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophil@@ es . &quot;
he was asked about his conversations with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and asked him to send even more photos .
he said he did it to l@@ ure them .
&quot; he said he was sick in the head when he drinks , and said that he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and weeping .
she then saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to speak with girls who looked much younger than him .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty as a result of the In@@ dict@@ ment of having admitted un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year , and did not appear before the court at a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im requested that Ho@@ gg would not appear in the register of sexual offen@@ ders , because he could argue that &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; could be found in his crime . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ cha@@ el postpon@@ ed the sentence until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; in this case Ho@@ gg was granted security deposit , but was held in custody because of hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was taken up before the date of the judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers do@@ dge to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken away from the major control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ gates emp@@ tied people from fear of discovery and arrest of people at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; since Tuesday , more than 1,000 refugees have been picked up along the river Inn River Inn in Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and con@@ ges@@ tion to the German side .
&quot; there , they are taken in reception by Federal Police officers and for@@ warded to the registration . &quot;
&quot; in comparison with the weekly start of the week , the Munich central station again met considerably more refugees . &quot;
&quot; some 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , a spokes@@ man in the morning said . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border on Tuesday , 17@@ 59 refugees reached the city . &quot;
Stuttgart : off@@ shoots of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn against falls in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area on Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low was the prec@@ ursor of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; which was pulled over the Atlantic from the Bermuda Islands over the last few days . &quot;
heavy storms and storms are expected mainly in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake District , the DW@@ D is expected to be between 60 and 90 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen again . &quot;
the masses are doing it : every two years the car makers at the IA@@ A show their novel@@ ties .
&quot; in 2015 , it is above all moving to compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot;
&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are in particular demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new regi@@ strations were accounted for by the German Federal Employment Agency ( KBA ) alone in August . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IA@@ A ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars and luxury cars , many new compact models will be introduced this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available to dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel is entering an entry below the biggest competi@@ tor VW Golf with a view , starting at € 17@@ 650 . &quot;
the current Astra will cost 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse range offers further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp up to 147 kW / / 200 hp , among which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competi@@ tor VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is initially only five @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the estate , which can also be seen at the International Motor Show ( IA@@ A ) . &quot;
and what will happen next to the Astra on the IA@@ A on new compact cars ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault launches the fourth generation of its Astra competi@@ tor Mé@@ gan@@ e .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as five @-@ door in a conventional and a sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; he comes to trade at the beginning of next year , and then as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan off@@ shoot wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; the compact Infin@@ iti , with its curved lines , fits perfectly into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will receive a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is also the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt .
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
&quot; according to manufacturer data , the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) . &quot;
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is expected in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not quite new , but completely renewed is the compact class DS 4 , which can be seen at the IA@@ A . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designer of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ers laid hands on the front end : here the radiator grill was re@@ drawn and the changed head@@ lights equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was especially modernis@@ ed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch screen and integrated for the first time Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a number of refin@@ ements and new variants such as the Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI have been added to the compact class at the IA@@ A in the compact class . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ fit
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the prison staff , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their dignity , deta@@ inees are entitled to receive financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this was decided by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision published on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , the persons concerned can even hope for money if they were confined within confined spaces for only a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 BvR 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ prisoner with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was accommod@@ ated in a single cell with around five square metres of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man who , according to his lawyer , was now on the loose leg , was transferred to a larger cell . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , his detention facility failed due to the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land of Berlin . &quot;
but the Constitutional Ju@@ dge raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber of Appe@@ als and re@@ mitted the case to the re@@ trial .
they see the man &apos;s dignity .
chamber Court decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of imprisonment for compensation were decisive for legal reasons , there was a compensation for compensation . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; a worsen@@ ing of the legal protection of the personality would be concerned . &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of money compensation .
the Constitutional Ju@@ dge has often strengthened the rights of prisoners in the past .
&quot; in April , they told a prisoner of in@@ action in April because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , the multiple assignment of a cell without separate toilet is also un@@ question@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed to an in@@ humane accommodation in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; over three months , the then cla@@ im@@ ant was accommod@@ ated between 15 and 21 hours a day in a homo@@ geneous cell , like in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case . &quot;
&quot; in the past few weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons had also come to the head@@ lines due to missing personnel . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always locked up for 23 hours , aggres@@ si@@ veness rises , even in fights it should have come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Ministry of Justice , 21 jobs in Te@@ gel are not occupied for lack of young talent , 19 are to be dropped off in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create the &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the German chan@@ cell@@ or is determined to accept it .
what will happen in Germany ?
&quot; according to the opinion of Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany , some 800 000 asylum seekers are expected to come to Germany this year , according to the opinion of Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) Germany . &quot;
&quot; Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) has demonstrated commitment in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; what is added to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
according to different forecasts of 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Construction ) and 400@@ 000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are needed annually - and for the next five years .
this is almost twice as much as it is built up to now ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of housing , above all in affordable rental properties , is dramatic : 60@@ ,000 to 80@@ ,000 social apartments fall out of the rental price and in addition to these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; this is far too little from the perspective of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80 000 social housing would have to be created each year , and the federal government would have to invest a total of 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year . &quot;
scientists and Federal Minister of Building agree that there must also be more tax advantages for investment in residential construction .
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , it is assumed that 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked about their qualifications to help them get started , &quot; says Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education at the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
but it is crucial for the integration of refugees whether they find work in Germany .
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the society society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; according to the German Chancellor , there has been a political turn@@ around in Germany : from the prohibition of working for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; whereas in the past there was a prohibition of working for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residential obligation to limit the asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled workers , the view has mostly been asser@@ ted that refugees should be quicker access to the labour market . &quot;
the lack of knowledge of German is a major barrier to access to the labour market .
&quot; up to now , there is no sufficient offer of general and occupational language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated by personal contacts .
&quot; for this reason , the establishment of networks is the Königs@@ weg path for integration in view of th@@ ron@@ ingen . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few deprived parents give their children to the kit@@ es , an estimated 10 to 15 percent : &quot; it is only once quite important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ z@@ schem@@ er , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators to rise sharply due to the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the training capacity - for example by allowing more specialist schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , pupils with no knowledge of German will be prepared for tuition . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but also by teachers , who only have qualifications in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate Stu@@ dying from the Berlin School Administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal state of asylum or tolerated the study - the only exception to date has been Berlin , Senator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has given up his position . &quot;
student willing refugees could be facilit@@ ated access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a residence permit or toler@@ ation do not receive any benefits according to the asylum seekers performance law , if they begin studying . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the latter do not get a b@@ af@@ ening as they do not fall under the circle of persons entitled to ban . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far to be entitled to B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , demanding Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should receive B@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should succ@@ essively allow Islam to include the same rights as the churches , and the existing state @-@ church law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ religion relationship . &quot;
&quot; it is also important to establish an Islamic well @-@ being association , who takes care of newcom@@ ers professionally . &quot;
duties also include duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam have to agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and to grant him certain control possibilities . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to take action against religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the President of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted such conflicts in Germany &quot; immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in future , integration will be much more than today a theme of the whole of society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the majority society will also have to change , and the reduction of discrimination and racism is becoming more urgent . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law for a decade .
&quot; however , it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U murder series showed that the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and the interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long been demanding and for which international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany are committed , must become reality in the next few years if the country is to remain peaceful and its new citizens should use their opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to provide medical care to the refugees waiting so far , &quot; says French president Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as for man@@ power and capacities , we create it , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money would have to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid bott@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery invites all the newcom@@ ers to the registration of health cards . &quot;
the services rendered could later be bil@@ led with the Bundes@@ länder .
&quot; in the long run , it is highly question@@ able to travel as many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum seekers performance law fores@@ ee . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors are doing the language barrier . &quot;
&quot; already so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are poorly understood by their diseases than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , but also in medical practices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over , it demands . &quot;
many refugees would also be helped with more general medical contact points in emergency ambul@@ ances .
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; in the case of refugee children , there is much more disability , and it is about HIV enligh@@ tenment among young people . &quot;
&quot; with the partially remaining cases of illness , German doctors came from their training , but clearly , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery believes . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; and as far as the doctors are concerned , there may be even allevi@@ ation in sight by the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Syri@@ ans had a highly developed educational system , and several refugees were even doctors . &quot;
&quot; in order to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly take ex@@ ams again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to the Federal Psych@@ otherap@@ ist ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) , most of them suffer from post@@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; refugee children are particularly vulnerable , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recent study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee is trau@@ mati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder suffer , among other things , the so @-@ called flash backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration problems , severe timi@@ dity and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; in order to prevent the symptoms from becoming chronic , an early treatment is necessary , &quot; says Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; to date , however , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive a psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although mentally ill asylum seekers in the social offices can provide a request for psych@@ otherapy , the processing usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices mostly function@@ aries or doctors who are not trained for mental illness decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to incorrect estimates , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; with the new &quot; Passion &quot; production , Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to draw every age group under the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst invites you to dre@@ aming in the man@@ ege on a brick .
&quot; our passion is circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , an animal teacher and junior chef . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current management of man@@ ure .
for more than 33 years the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family .
the family therefore lies in the blood with the gift for lovers .
&quot; it is important for us to take away people from their daily routine and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; &quot; the 27 @-@ year @-@ old junior chef emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , is named &quot; &quot; cosm@@ opolitan cocktail with cosm@@ opolitan flair &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the almost 3,000 kilometres long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the circus programme convin@@ ces with talented artists from all over the world .
&quot; awarded the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family captiv@@ ates the public with wit and charm . &quot;
the Cas@@ tillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent films , the Cuban duo wants to easily record . &quot;
light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify .
her hum@@ orous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst is also intrigu@@ ed by intuition and arti@@ cular feeling . &quot;
to balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics know how little others and fascin@@ ates with their mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer diversity in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; says Steph@@ an@@ ies Mutter , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of circus animals are all too often subject to various animal welfare organisations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst looks at her position : &quot; &quot; if we don &apos;t go well with our animals , we are not doing well either . &quot;
approximately 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged Arti@@ sts , &quot; as they are called lovingly , will be read by the eyes whenever possible . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel comfortable , it does not want to enter the man@@ ege . &quot;
so the first commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony@@ stallion and a Zeb@@ ra@@ stu@@ te , the Pro@@ bst family is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together eight years in a enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the circus , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is for sure , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or 1,@@ 200 spectators , we always give our best and with all my heart . &quot;
&quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst from September 17 through 20 , invites to his performances daily at 17 and 20 o &apos;clock . &quot;
on Sunday the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.@@ m .
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the presentation at 5@@ pm the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the animal life is open every day from 10 am to 6 pm . &quot;
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe positions wrong speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , the oldest leader in Africa , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly across the social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by the asser@@ tions made by members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with j@@ okes .
&quot; last month , they had de@@ pressed him and suspended him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
the spokes@@ man for democratic change Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to interfere with Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; death &apos; , he told journalists about Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the Parliament members concerned that immunity will end in parliament and as soon as they leave parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers of politicians .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard will work up to 30,000 jobs &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard is expected to build 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; later this year , HP will split into two listed companies and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing corporate hardware and service operations . &quot;
&quot; the expected job reduction results in a load of over 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , &quot; said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Pack@@ ard Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after the separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and in @-@ depth portfolio of businesses that help companies transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Pack@@ ard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual sales and &quot; will be focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; says the company &apos;s statement . &quot;
it is a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Pack@@ ard to manufacture electrical systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage was named &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to handle the aband@@ on@@ ment of traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the conviction that closely focused companies provide better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates must stand behind the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger stressed to Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation was going according to plan there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four matches for England and in view of its history his participation in the next summer is certainly uncertain .
the great shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the pres@@ e@@ ason .
&quot; this kind of injury does not threaten career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it &apos;s a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
that is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger recognized , there is the associated risk of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the study of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd registers 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of arsen@@ als 157 lig@@ ators during the last five seasons .
&quot; the broader picture of Arsenal is that they have been one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight times since 2007 / 08 , who have noticed most of the injury days . &quot;
Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle but Arsenal does believe that an improvement in the risk of injury lasts during the last season .
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time when you need to strengthen your body and win battle power , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope his body stabil@@ ises , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the kind that he deserves . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al begins its Champions League season on Wednesday evening against Din@@ amo Zagreb in front of the matches against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur upcoming Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger introduces himself to a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey did not travel to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also start with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and allow the players who need it to take a little break , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although arsen@@ al is clear favour@@ ites to advance through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation in Europe . &quot;
Dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was shaken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , with a scale of 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale . &quot;
&quot; this year , it was 10th in Zagreb . &quot;
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn the lesson from last season with the Champions League capit@@ ulation against Monaco and remains driven away from the distant hope to lead the association to his first European Cup triumph .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked in arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
friendship Party : comedy show giving us serious lessons about male friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more du@@ bi@@ ous than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , Camp@@ a@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably announced ( Cal@@ m - campaign against a w@@ ret@@ ched life ) 2015 as the year of the man with the aim of asking the culture to ask the men to seek help if they need them . &quot;
friendship is at the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study involving more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends will hal@@ ve the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends so that friendship can work .
&quot; in the age of communication convey@@ ed via social media , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital lives have doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful even if in reality the isolation predomin@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship that affects our mental health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
the nic@@ est thing about Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was not defined by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one by interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ lers frequent hu@@ gs , moments at the football match in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire from Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can definitely refer to it , even if they often hold back to explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the telephone counsel@@ ing explained to me , &quot; &quot; My role for listening to people who feel de@@ pressed and com@@ mitting suicide has really shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I get along with it &quot; &quot; has an enormous effect , as the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the little moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider &apos;s status over the telephone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; so if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with the setting of the day completely re@@ designed scenery , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see in Star@@ bu@@ cks someone sitting around alone , give him a smile and say hello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to Com@@ edy Central from the beginning to the end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to break down Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; with his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday , she will help PS@@ G pass past Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani held course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park stadium on Tuesday .
&quot; Maria met less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master on the way , but afterwards she missed a number of occasions before she finally raised her lead when Cav@@ ani got a head ball in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A Paris needs a strong start against the Swedish master , as they are not only striving for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , it was not a classic example of Laurent Blan@@ cs &apos;s team with Z@@ lat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . later he was replaced in the game against his home town team and against the association with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause our opponents problems and to look back , even if there are certain things we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; this is a good sign .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we didn &apos;t have one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which at the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 tie at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was kno@@ cked out by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ ine@@ an wing storm was described as the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he entered in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ ti Pass after the Malm@@ ö defense before he passed Johan Wil@@ hem into the long corner of the grid . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who hit Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , joined An@@ pi@@ per with nine national players on the field and had a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field lined up a heavy opponent . &quot;
&quot; but apart from a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps Post in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave itself up , with some failures and bad degrees , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who p@@ atz@@ te alone in the first half in no less than five experiments and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had used it after re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow @-@ players into play , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot by Wil@@ hem at the pole in the 5@@ 2nd minute ... &quot;
the second goal finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth place of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well .
&quot; this ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö was able to come back to play , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ hem in the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz , could keep the end result low before the replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de later admitted that PS@@ G played a class on his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualifying matches are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core ga@@ thers 2.5 billion dollars from stock sales

&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the USA at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , X@@ is &apos;s first official in Washington , will take place on 25 September and responds to President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented a switch to FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i plays for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; apparently a few years ago , the FC Bayern was shortly before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times Cup winner , four times Champions League winner , twice world champion , twice world champion , twice world champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old moved to FC Barcelona for 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now reveals that he already stood before the Euro 2008 before leaving Barcelona . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me . &quot;
&quot; reminder : in summer 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann assumed the FC Bayern . &quot;
Guardi@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this works today for the German record champion : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has contracted Guardi@@ ola and I have played a great European Championship . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .
&quot; that &apos;s what he got me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
who knows how Bavaria &apos;s season 2008 / 2009 would have run with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quarter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians across the entire distance on the lawn , the reds switched off ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated at the end the King &apos;s Triumph . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays diversity in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confron@@ ting Af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about the diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a succession of Sunday Night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , the experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives , while referring to a black protagon@@ ist in the project &apos;s chosen script . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , do it with the cast of the film and not with the cast of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted , shocked , with insul@@ ting un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . wow . &quot; when the comments of the actor of The Mar@@ tian soli@@ di@@ fied . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to encourage people to think about - who will always be the director - how they treat the figure of Harmon@@ y , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a nun , beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ acci@@ o for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broad@@ cast@@ ed , the social media explo@@ ded in front of dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on &quot; about the only black person in space so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO K@@ NO@@ W@@ ING that it hur@@ ts .
&quot; the twe@@ ets have earned more than 5,000 ret@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments are at a time when accurate racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
&quot; after the death of Michael Brown in 2014 by a white polic@@ eman , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement grew throughout the country and urged legis@@ lators and authorities to cur@@ b discrimin@@ atory practices against colour livel@@ ih@@ oods . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made a reference to the movement during the introduction of the nominated album of the year at Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album quiet , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have published an explanation in response to the question of the Fox News representative , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be considered as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ les invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sport climbing and operating aid Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first athlete who won the American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday night and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who was able to complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and c@@ amer@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , until the final . &quot;
&quot; for the last job , climbing was a 75 foot long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten finished the task at the time he was the first athlete to complete the exhau@@ sting phase 4 of American N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge fully three seconds faster , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! news after the hard @-@ won victory , still under the shock of winning the Big Prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had my life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
all of a sudden .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the fin@@ als and why Brit@@ ten , although he finished the course first , did not receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , the one gets the fastest time , &quot; We@@ ed said . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the grand sati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he h@@ ates any gru@@ dge .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received the masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be beaten by someone , then I &apos;m glad that Isaac is . &quot;
&quot; and I think that Isaac felt the same , if they had changed the roles . &quot;
America N@@ in@@ ja Warri@@ or has been extended for a season season and the shooting will start in spring 2016 .
Detroit Tiger sli@@ ps past Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ -- The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tiger .
&quot; formerly they once belonged to one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ ilers , but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in Target Field on Tuesday . &quot;
the T@@ wins have wasted a chance to ascend within a half of the Houston Ast@@ ros season for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , although only for one evening , it was a return of the three letters F @-@ word that was so hard to grasp for a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories make fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Out@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon maintained his early offensive support , when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in the sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen every game , and so I want to go into the game quite concentrated . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ dog Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three @-@ hit hit by Mart@@ ine@@ z ever since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th .
&quot; he has swept the Schla@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; Aus@@ mus said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at the ( punch training ) , looked clearly better from the bull@@ pen , and he brought it directly into the game . &quot;
&quot; with three R@@ uns in the back meeting at the end of the seventh inside , the T@@ wins had their best chance to come back to play . &quot;
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton completed the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man with whom he was confronted , before the designated ro@@ ok@@ ie drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who escaped the right @-@ handed drummer Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen into a two @-@ run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finale run on the second , Ver@@ hagen added the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
it was the 27th time this season in the Major League that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit Double Play
&quot; when Detroit joined an Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inner ring , Wall abol@@ ished an R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed people , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano in three pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning of the game , Detroit was able to benefit from a non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers achieved three laps in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been cancelled before the game from the vulner@@ ability list after he had been missing more than a month for a back suffering . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning I wished for , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt happ@@ ier when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first , flus@@ hes broke out a single of Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ s@@ ler . &quot;
a two @-@ out walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z into play that made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; during the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z created his 0 @-@ 21 success story with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers placed in the second , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ der Anthony GO@@ SE to the 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; this was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not strike very well , but he got the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before he was replaced by the Reli@@ ever right @-@ handed people A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and one walk with four strokes .
comments : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder de@@ ple@@ tion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z from the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris will be removed from the vulner@@ ability list to compete against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on 30 July
he has been missing since 20 August because of a cr@@ ushing in the right hip joint .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in Target Field on Wednesday
Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 ; 4.@@ 73 )
hundreds of refugees to be defeated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on its way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people involved in this project will then be housed in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , such as the city of Wiesbaden on Tuesday evening . &quot;
it counted 450 to 750 refugees arriving .
several sports halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital were prepared for this case in recent days .
&quot; up to 1,000 refugees can temporarily perish there . &quot;
they are then to be spread to other communities .
&quot; in the last ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse , according to the presi@@ ding presi@@ ding judge responsible for the initial tak@@ eover . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also furnished emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls for the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military action in Syria an option
&quot; head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he accused the European states &quot; collective way@@ far@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; four years ago , one was glad that the cup had passed a military involvement in Germany . &quot;
&quot; now the conflict is crashing on our door@@ step , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive boost of international aid to refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria also re@@ introduced controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , Austrian Minister Johanna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , Austrian TV station ORF , announced that no one will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
even Germany did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , it is agreed , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement with which Germany could take up a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said it had already given talks between the General Director of Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; over the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees came to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary . &quot;
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann applied for a special summit for the next week together with several other EU leaders .
Germany had started with temporary border checks on Sunday .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on a joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; the EU interior ministers want to take a new trial for the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees on Tuesday ( 22 September ) on a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong demand for refugees in Germany , the Federal Government wants to support the countries in the first @-@ time and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced in the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister at the Chancellor &apos;s Office in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined those people , who would need protection . &quot;
but those who do not have a lead @-@ eye view could not stay in Germany either .
this view had been strongly split in the round .
the Chancellor stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; enormous effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees stuck in the Balkan Route .
Hungary had closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border to Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced that it would also set the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers seeking ev@@ asive routes across Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to to the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government immediately condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , thousands of other migrants accounted for the Greek border . &quot;
room probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice sheet of Saturn &apos;s Saturn En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us there is a global ocean .
this includes researchers from observations of the Cass@@ ini room probe .
&quot; according to this , the moon is slightly stag@@ gering on its orbit around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; although this exchange movement is only small but still too large for a solid state of cel@@ esti@@ al bodies , it is stated in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) on Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers present their analyses in the journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
&quot; for a long time , it was known that under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us there must be liquid water . &quot;
&quot; in 2006 , &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice volcan@@ oes at the South Pole of Saturn , which sp@@ its water vap@@ or and ice particles and therefore feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole there must be an underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed then . &quot;
&quot; however , the extent of the hidden ocean was not cleared . &quot;
R@@ ama missing in 1860 München several weeks
&quot; around one month , the 1860 München must ab@@ stain from Val@@ det R@@ ama offensive player . &quot;
the association with its 27 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ duc@@ tor injury gave the association .
R@@ ama already compla@@ ined about pain in the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to the Lion of Munich , the diagnosis means &quot; four weeks of forced break . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think about it now , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ vali@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper , looking at the possible engagement of an un@@ compromising professionals . &quot;
&quot; however , as a training guest , the Six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at the moment , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the opportunity to prove his skills . &quot; &quot;
tor@@ j@@ äger Ru@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training next week after his conc@@ ussion .
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to enter the running training . &quot;
Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) .
&quot; contrary to his first fears , he remained without a serious ir@@ ony . &quot;
no fruit - man@@ goes contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his lean line are often dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
&quot; because man@@ goes contain relatively large amounts of sugar , especially su@@ c@@ rose . &quot;
&quot; however , the exotic fruits are healthy : B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain lots of vitamin A and its pre @-@ stage beta @-@ carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits support vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ goes should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant to smell . &quot;
&quot; the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so , green man@@ goes can taste very tasty . &quot;
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; a man@@ go , however , also gives hearty dishes a special note . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney goes well with fish , poultry , lamb and game . &quot;
the U.S. package service U@@ PS represents up to 9@@ 5000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the USA .
&quot; the company already started recruitment of seasonal workers , divided U@@ PS on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; above all , drivers are sought . &quot;
last year U@@ PS raised its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5000 hel@@ pers .
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competi@@ tor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year in order to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought the package services harsh criticism . &quot;
&quot; first blow @-@ tower , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , the F@@ öhn winds its way in the valleys of the alpine side of the F@@ öhn , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz printed on Tuesday . &quot;
on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday the fo@@ eh@@ n partly blows with whi@@ rl@@ wind through the fo@@ eh@@ nel valleys .
&quot; after F@@ öhn@@ ende on Thursday morning , we cross a distinctive cold front that brings powerful rain@@ falls , wind gu@@ sts and a decrease in temperature . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area over the British Is@@ les in a strong south@@ western flow . &quot;
on the side of the mountain on the night of Wednesday the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys .
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn blows in the fo@@ eh@@ el valleys with gu@@ sts from 60 to 100 km / h , occasionally and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the hair @-@ dryer can advance in places to the adjacent centre and on the mountains , even hurri@@ can@@ es of more than 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday a stor@@ my hair dryer ensures summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , moisture begins to st@@ ow on the slope of the mountain . &quot;
&quot; here the rain starts , which lasts until Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; in total , in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 liters of rain per square meter must be expected in the next 48 hours . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the F@@ öhn winds the air , as a result , a cold front with powerful , partly swe@@ at@@ y rain from west to east goes over Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; along with the cold front the wind is blowing strongly up to stor@@ my , and temperatures are clearly decreasing . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south , on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at the weekend with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin @-@ Luther @-@ Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of City President Ig@@ na@@ zio Mar@@ ino , a previously nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
in &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nom@@ en@@ cl@@ ature was requested by the working group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
&quot; on Wednesday , Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of the Pop@@ es were often only able to live their faith in secret for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the square becomes visible , that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) stayed in Rome as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 .
&quot; at that time , he found the city as a perfect sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
his negative impressions should have reinforced him in his later fight against Rome in his later fight against Rome .
Luther had then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his thes@@ es against indul@@ gence .
Hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) crown of thorns is one of the major works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost wrote the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar @-@ Old Bible , which now appeared with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the image for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas in 150 motifs . &quot;
his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colours and imagin@@ ative forms has preserved the 75 year old - but this is by no means equivalent to &quot; funny &quot; pictures .
&quot; on the contrary , it can be quite glo@@ omy . &quot;
&quot; for some three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective and artistic choice from the many subjects of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; these are cycles that dedic@@ ate themselves to topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or father@@ land . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with his the@@ ological orientation as well as for the Kettler Publ@@ ishers with his focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the Bible passages selected by Ot@@ mar Old and thus translated into &quot; &quot; Today , into Current Issu@@ es &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts &apos;s painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original quotation from Martin Luther and a set of the artist , who formulated his very personal thoughts on the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high degree of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family that belonged to the strict Protestant ruler . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; &quot; recalls Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
I tried to work up to bring me back to the Lord again .
&quot; his second concern is to bring art back to more significance in the quick@@ ening of time : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is shaped by advertisement today , and that is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being sup@@ planted .
artists have another desire and delight to show things .
pictures always have something mysterious and are not decorative .
&quot; in this regard , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt would like the viewer to &quot; &quot; fall in &quot; &quot; into the images , let them appear , discover and sense the force they have : &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its opposite . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost stood on Tuesday at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible presentation in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ert &apos;s art : &quot; I like him to live with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I did not take care not to fully grasp the Bible , but also to select the most important , even mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration at eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here is the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler of the Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as the responsibility .
part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas prints - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition opened on 15 November in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation .
construction work starts for BM@@ X trains
&quot; plans made , place found , companies commissioned , Erd@@ hü@@ gel mod@@ eled for a round course : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway was already finished . &quot;
&quot; there were failures in politics and administration for dr@@ um@@ ming , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; thus , hill de@@ ported , new place wanted - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be made in October , the first joint expert Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck has now been informed in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still happening , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then be started without a &quot; &quot; more commem@@ oration &quot; &quot; with the works of the former indoor swimming pool . &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees from 2019 , and the Bundes@@ liga cat@@ ers for a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football re@@ acts to the worsen@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tackl@@ ing the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t bother me , I have nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this has to interest each individual to get a grip on this issue , &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; during the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the Chanc@@ ellery and meet there the Minister of State , Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football can and may help .
&quot; however , the decisive turn@@ out must put politics . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the German Football Association has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; by four years . &quot;
&quot; we ensured that this programme will continue until 2019 , &quot; &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal states also support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professionals will mark a clear sign when they will carry on the left tri@@ cot , instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) the im@@ print &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; said L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en &apos;s sports editor Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; a matter of course . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee drama goes on , nobody can see . &quot;
&quot; no , we must use our power , influence and opportunities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s managing director Peter Ret@@ tig was speaking of a &quot; prominent &quot; sign of the League .
&quot; on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a big joint work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 license clubs in their places had started their own projects was great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active there .
&quot; the message &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; we have spent is lived in football . &quot;
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the Association together with the DF@@ B selection and the federal government provides 300 000 Euros for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already picked up the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; &quot; said Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
reports : SAP board of directors loses eye in case of accident
&quot; according to several reports , the head of the board of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , has re@@ port@@ edly lost the left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an accident on the staircase in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , after midnight he had fallen on a water glas which he had worn in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost bleeding , power@@ less , then pulled out into the street - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quotes the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t could pursue his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet before the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager is at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; naturally I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important for him to go to the public with such a personal story , said the manager of the &quot; &quot; S@@ Z &quot; &quot; : &quot; &quot; everyone can do something like this . &quot;
it is important to stand up once you &apos;ve fallen .
Mc@@ L@@ aren replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...
Magn@@ us@@ sen t@@ wit@@ ched a similar photograph and explained that he suffered the injury when he was over@@ thrown by the wheel .
&quot; he therefore comes as little as spare @-@ sail@@ ers for the two Stam@@ b@@ il@@ ot Fernando Al@@ on@@ so and J@@ ens@@ on Button , like a week later at the Grand Prix of Japan . &quot;
constitutional Complaints ( BvR ) ( Bv@@ Q ) ( Number of result : 1 )
&quot; at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund , all hopes for a com@@ eback of Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally broken . &quot;
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga as well in the du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar on Thursday ( 7 p.m. / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot rely on him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga match against L@@ ever@@ kus@@ en , the B@@ V@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; given the high loading capacity of its professionals , Tu@@ chel is not only able to change its stem cells on the R@@ eus position . &quot;
thus he announced a change to the goal keeper position .
therefore Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master @-@ keepers Roman natur@@ ki .
&quot; he trained at an absolute top level , &quot; the soccer teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all European league games in the future , however , Tu@@ va left open . &quot;
&quot; with high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ging statement by fellow player R@@ eus , that the final suit for the B@@ V@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , considers Mittel@@ feld@@ sph@@ Julian Wei@@ gl for understandable : &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot cars : government wants leadership role for Germany
&quot; according to the Federal Government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the transformation of cars . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet resolved a strategy paper from the home of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ brin@@ dt ( CS@@ U ) , which among other things stipul@@ ated investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ brin@@ dt spoke of a &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the automated and connected driving will increase road safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ brin@@ dt . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the issue with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 States , who also come together with representatives of the industry at the International Motor Show ( IA@@ A ) . &quot;
&quot; the strategy paper of the Ministry of Transport stresses , among other things , the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and spe@@ edy delivery to digital radio stations . &quot;
&quot; for testing new technology , a test track is currently being built on the highway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; not take any additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; the Federal Government intends to &quot; &quot; check the legal framework &quot; &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to make use of around the world that the maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars is increased from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government intends to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention , which so far only fores@@ ees the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car is increasingly taking the lead , and the driver becomes more and more a passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study commissioned by the Ministry of Economic Affairs , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , dri@@ ver@@ less vehicles on public roads &quot; should not be expected until 2020 . &quot;
&quot; value creation in the area of driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany , the authors of the study estimate for 20@@ 25 to some 8.@@ 4 billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said S &amp; D vice @-@ president S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the Germans are still looking scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday , commissioned by the For@@ sa institute , concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will be able to assert itself in the next ten years , 32 percent do not count on that at all in 20 years , 31 percent do not believe at all . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of the respon@@ dents account for up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to completely rely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; after a survey of the Bit@@ kom digital association , only seven percent would agree to hand over control during the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; at least 15 percent of the traffic on the motorway , in traffic jams , could be 45 percent . &quot;
well every fourth would leave the car control under no circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to the current status of the title fight from September 25 to October 4 , the Düsseldorf plans to open only in singles . &quot;
the final decision shall fall at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the boys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; says Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
Bol@@ l was at that time on the flight to a long @-@ term sponsored walk in China .
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo , the down@@ side is that we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; explained the single European champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ sch@@ ist in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the European Championship in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; Timo also lack@@ ed , and we became European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should orient@@ ate ourselves on that , &quot; explained the World Ranking List . &quot;
the English football player Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United has suffered a serious injury on the right leg .
&quot; in the Champions League game at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , the defender was hit by a Tac@@ kl@@ ing by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno and replaced after a long treatment . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : window mannequins that look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
&quot; they bear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I am the f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is visible from 18 September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his initially negative attitude to a show about his person . &quot;
&quot; actually he had been against it , because : &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had already taken place in Montreal and Paris Station .
&quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ deren . &quot;
&quot; it concerns tolerance , acceptance and vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly visible work of the man who wrote fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; the show is not built up chron@@ ologically , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall art work , for which a lot of effort was done : to indulge the d@@ olls , for example a sty@@ list was hired . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have stolen 14 tons of material to Munich . &quot;
just before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special treat : a leather h@@ osen outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; ) and for people who are a bit different said Gau@@ l@@ tier .
also Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
it stands for the designer &apos;s first hes@@ it@@ ant fashion experiments .
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) , he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and clothes , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers like Gau@@ l@@ tier in Munich .
&quot; later I bought them , but of course I bought them . &quot;
for his first own fashion show he did not have to pay the models .
&quot; they got nothing , but they were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of curtain - P@@ lau@@ ener tip as a fashion niche
earlier we went to the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters .
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in a large quantity for customers , who worked on them for example for blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; today this alone is no longer working , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en Mo@@ gran@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is important again . &quot;
&quot; in the early days of the P@@ lau@@ en peak fashion has played a major role , was then pushed aside by the textile industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , for accessories like bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans on past Sti@@ le@@ po@@ chen , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
those who do not use ni@@ ches in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already have half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the branch association P@@ lau@@ en lace and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; over the last 15 years , some 80 percent of sales have been broken away . &quot;
private trade and wholesale trade are almost no longer available .
our products barely reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass @-@ produced goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and almost exclusively sold via chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports are weak@@ ening , currently in Russia and in the US . &quot;
there are plenty of reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score points through environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains by the embroi@@ dery industry in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have been leading a seal of quality that shows that we produce environmentally and socially acceptable . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; this relates to the materials used . &quot;
&quot; diploma designer , U@@ te Schmidt , teaches at the Schne@@ e@@ berger Exter@@ enst@@ elle of the Z@@ wick@@ au University of Saxony - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and lace . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the competition from the Asian region , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of the designers and the firms that have to think above all economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , an existing design is often only slightly different in order to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter re@@ gained the historic snow@@ ball tip . &quot;
&quot; at some places , the machine bridges small spheres . &quot;
&quot; the lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took his inspiration from it : &quot; before that , I couldn &apos;t do anything with the traditional P@@ lau@@ en summit . &quot;
now she uses the snow ball tip for her jewelry .
&quot; in an elaborate procedure , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the theme of &quot; &quot; Pla@@ ener Spitze ® - young and old &quot; , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it also delivers to the USA , Australia and Finland - especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who want a mem@@ ento . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ en peak .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney dar@@ es to make a new film about his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a re@@ fil@@ ement , but a kind of continuation that plays 20 years after the first movie with the magical baby girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director already stands firmly : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly to the world
&quot; the economy needs to open more broad@@ ly to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group in charge of steering the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investments and know @-@ how and improve strategies for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in an address at the 16th session of the Central Command Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new place for economic growth , &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the management group has adopted a set of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabit@@ ant milking system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is drawn up that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a right @-@ wing business environment and making the market more open , &quot; said the statement . &quot;
the government will also ease controls over the powers transferred to the company and make sure companies decide how to manage their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investment and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ financed corporations and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or the &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and making the application process easier . &quot;
&quot; the right of the lawyers to guarantee their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated in the meeting as announced in a declaration published after the meeting .
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission aims to double the limits for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thereby mi@@ tig@@ ate consumers with a significantly higher dose of nerve toxins .
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , having a corresponding EU working paper , sharply critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policies are passed on with full force on pregnant women and to@@ dd@@ lers , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ word@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily poll@@ uted with mercury that , on the basis of the still valid limit values , about 50 percent of catches can not be sold . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able . &quot;
&quot; in return for this e@@ asing , according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to increase the limit values for other fish from 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as a &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p are usually so low , that they already comply with the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ del distra@@ ction maneu@@ ver that helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
&quot; mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is mainly concentrated in predat@@ ory fish through the food chain . &quot;
&quot; the German government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; low quantities can cause already low levels of damage to the nervous system &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry says on its homepage with regard to the maximum values in force , however , that a &quot; health threat to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by the burning of coal into the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Ministry of the Environment , the German coal @-@ fired power stations come across more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two @-@ thirds of the total quantity issued in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish , for example in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube , is &quot; permanently and comprehen@@ sively exceeded , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted from the paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish already included the most commonly reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
