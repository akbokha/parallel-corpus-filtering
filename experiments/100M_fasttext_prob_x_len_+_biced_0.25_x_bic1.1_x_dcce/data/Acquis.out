&quot; a ) The Community of the Organisation , in accordance with this Convention , con@@ veys information on the core material that is subject to safegu@@ ards , and the characteristics of the equipment used to carry out preventive measures relating to this material of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
B ) The organization requires only the minimum of information and data which is compatible with the implementation of its tasks according to this Convention .
&quot; II ) Information on plants is restricted to the minimum , which is necessary for the use of preventive measures in relation to the core material which is subject to the securing measures under this agreement . &quot;
&quot; C ) In seeking the community , the organization is prepared to check investment data that the community considers to be particularly vulnerable in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not need to be materi@@ ally transferred to the organization , provided they remain accessible for further testing by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) The Organization shall bring the consent of the Community and the States to the designation of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) Provi@@ des the community either against a proposed denom@@ ination or at some point against a certain designation saying , the organization of the Community and the States proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; ( III ) If due to the repeated refusal of the Community to agree to the designation of inspec@@ tors of the organization , which are hin@@ dered due to this agreement , the Council shall den@@ ounce the refusal , after the General Director of the Organization ( herein@@ after referred to as &quot; the Director General &quot; ) , with the objective of meeting the appropriate measure . &quot;
&quot; B ) The Community and the countries concerned shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization , according to their agreement , can actually provide them . &quot;
C ) The visits and activities of the supervis@@ ors of the organization are set up in such a way that i ) are as small as possible for the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and interference for the Community and the States and for the peaceful nuclear activities that are subject to inspection ;
II ) ensuring the protection of industrial secrets and other the inspec@@ tors of the organisation for knowledge of sensitive information .
&quot; each State applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and funds , as well as to its inspec@@ tors and other officials , to fulfill the duties of the agreement on the Privil@@ eg@@ es and Liberation of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the securing measures in accordance with this Convention are terminated with regard to core material when the community and the organization establish that the material has been consumed or dil@@ uted in a way that it is no longer usable for a nuclear activity , which is under the aspect of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang , or is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; according to this Convention , the Association noti@@ fies the transfer of core material from the States which is subject to the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention are terminated with regard to the core material as soon as the recipient country , as fores@@ een in this Convention , has assumed responsibility for this . &quot;
&quot; the organization carries out documents from which each passing and , if necessary , the re @-@ application of the securing measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; in the event of non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the production of alloys or ceramics , the community will agree with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the safegu@@ ards according to this agreement can be terminated in relation to this material . &quot;
&quot; II ) that during the period of non @-@ application of the preventive measures , the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear missi@@ les . &quot;
&quot; B ) The organization and the community meet a provision that the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Agreement shall not be applied for so long , as the core material is used in such an activity . &quot;
&quot; the provision is determined as far as possible , for how long and under what circumstances these safegu@@ ards are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are once again applied once the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization is kept on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of this material in the relevant state or the states concerned and on any transfer of such material from this state or states .
&quot; this explains their agreement as quickly as possible ; it extends only on matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or a knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organisation , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in carrying out their respective obligations arising from this Convention . &quot;
&quot; if the Community , the States or the persons who are subject to their sovereign powers , however , extraordinary costs are incurred as a result of a special request of the organization , the organization will reimbur@@ se these costs as long as it has been clari@@ fied beforehand . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and samples required by the organization &apos;s inspec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security , may be entitled to the organization and its officials for the purpose of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as to the nation@@ als of the States . &quot;
&quot; any claim made by the Community or a State to the Organization or the Organisation to the Community or the State for Dam@@ ages - with the exception of Dam@@ age from a nuclear incident , arising from the implementation of the safegu@@ ards according to this Convention shall be governed in accordance with international law . &quot;
&quot; if the Council , after examining the relevant information provided by the General Director , determines that the organization has not been able to verify that there is no nuclear material that has to be subjected to securing measures under this Convention , for nuclear weapons or other nuclear missi@@ les , it may also refund the reports provided in Article X@@ II and paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the other measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which measure has been achieved by the applied preventive measures , takes into account the community or the state - as far as each of the two contracting parties is concerned - every reasonable opportunity to grant the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Organization , the Community or a State , consultations on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States are entitled to seek out that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention , are reviewed by the Council . &quot;
the Council invites the Community and the State concerned to take part in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of disputes arising from a statement of the Council pursuant to Article 19 or any of the measures taken by the Council , disputes arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be submitted to an Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal based on the application of a party which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and states design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four appointed arbitr@@ ators choose a fifth who pres@@ ides over . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the organization have not named two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days after the application for an appeal , the Community or the Organization may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint this arbitr@@ ator . &quot;
the same procedure shall be applied if within thirty days after the nom@@ ination or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal shall be competent , and all resolutions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organisation , the Community and the States concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Convention shall apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons States , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the community , in force , i ) when the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and &quot;
&quot; ( II ) If the Association of Organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The organization , the community and the states consult each other on request of one of the contracting parties about a change in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All changes require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The General Director immediately noti@@ fies all Member States of the Organization about any change in this Convention .
&quot; a ) This Convention enters into force on the day that the organization of the Community and the States receives the written notification , that their procedures are concluded for entry into force . &quot;
B ) This Convention shall remain in force for so long as the States are the contracting party of the contract .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures to be applied when implementing the provisions of Part I on preventive measures .
&quot; the aim of the securing measures specified in this Convention is the timely detection of the bran@@ ching of significant quantities of nuclear activities for nuclear weapons and other nuclear targets for unknown purposes , as well as deter@@ rence of such a branch by the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; to enrich the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a securing measure of fundamental importance , composite with spatial input and observation as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical conclusion of the audit by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which material quantity , which is not proven for a certain period of time , is specified under specification of the accuracy limits for the specified quantities . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their investigations , the organization according to Article 3 makes full use of the security system of the community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Materials in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their safegu@@ ards , the Community shall make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind and , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are closer to the supplementary agreements and are expe@@ dient : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system to determine the quantities of preserved , manufactured , lost , lost or otherwise derived material and stock quantities ; &quot;
B ) the evaluation of the reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and the accuracy of measurements and the assessment of the measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedures for the evaluation of accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured stocks and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which indicates the core material inventory and the changes in this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
precau@@ tions to ensure that the accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure to reimbur@@ se reports to the organization in accordance with Articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the securing measures according to this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; B ) ur@@ anium ( or th@@ orium containing material , which has not yet reached the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) , the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) leaves core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope accumulation , the plant or process phase in which it is produced , or will be introduced in the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other safegu@@ ards mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Agreement shall be terminated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . if the conditions specified in Article 11 are not fulfilled , the association is not possible or desirable in accordance with this Convention , the organisation and the community consult each other on the application of suitable securing measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Agreement shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organisation and the community agree on the fact that this material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the community , the organization liber@@ ates the following core material from the securing measures according to this agreement : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in gram or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nu@@ clear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such nuclear material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um 2@@ 38 , which is above 80 % . &quot;
&quot; upon request of the Community , the organization of nuclear material , which would otherwise be subject to safegu@@ ards according to this Convention , exemp@@ t from these safegu@@ ards , provided that the total material quantity delivered by this article in the states is at no time more than &quot;
a ) a total of a kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material which can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
&quot; ur@@ anium with a enrich@@ ment , which is below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium , calcul@@ ates by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ; &quot;
&quot; B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium , with a enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ; &quot;
C ) 20 metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with a enrich@@ ment of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; to process or store free core material together with the core material that is subject to the securing measures according to this Convention , precau@@ tions are made for re @-@ application of security measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organisation of supplementary agreements , which is necessary in the scope that is required for the successful and effective provision of the tasks of the Organization according to this Convention , in particular how the procedures laid down in the Convention are to be applied . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or changed without modification of this agreement in agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the organisation , the community and the states undertake all efforts in order for these agreements to come into effect within nin@@ ety days following the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires a take @-@ on between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report named in Article 62 , the organization provides a summ@@ arized inventory of the total , the security measures of the underlying core material in the states , regardless of its origin , and continues this inventory based on the following reports and the results of their investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
&quot; the EEC has decided to contribute to the special action program defined at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes , whose development is ham@@ pered by general res@@ sources ran@@ som problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the EEC and Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is tied in six months after the entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years of entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted one another on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the middle b@@ ind@@ ings to ensure a wide and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the Organization of the EEC has presented a table for which it is evident in which way it intends to apply the criteria laid down in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization establishes a special account under the term &quot; &quot; special action account &quot; &quot; which consists of the funds which the member states contribute to the special transaction account ; this account is managed and used by the organization as administrator , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special transaction account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment takes place in the form of cash or in@@ solvency of the member state to pay upon request in the currency of the respective state to order the organization as administrator of the special transaction account and to deposit at the deposit of the organization in the respective country .
B ) The payment is made in two inst@@ al@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the order within 30 days after the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the Man@@ age at the agreed time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the contribution of the contribution to 1 January 1979 , or at another time , which was agreed between the EEC and the Administrator , taking into account the periods required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget plans . &quot;
&quot; C ) E@@ ach Member State may , upon request , make payments before the aforementioned deadlines . &quot;
&quot; according to the usual methods of the organization , the ste@@ ward takes about proportion@@ ate drawing on the cash or the school notes to cover expenses for the special loans and to compensate the special transaction in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; in the case of granting this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
VI ) the composition and the tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its subsequent loan capacity to loan conditions without discount ; and
VII ) the extent in which the problems of the countries concerned can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each transaction loan is used to finance a clearly defined and rapidly pay@@ able development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral project ) , regardless of whether it is a loan program of the organization or not , according to the procedures and practices , which is to be considered , under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of a special transaction account must not be used instead of the Bank &apos;s Bank or Organisation &apos;s Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved by the Bank &apos;s directors or the organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special loans are subject to the same withdrawal conditions which are generally accepted by the organization ; they are thus ref@@ und@@ able in ten years of free time each . &quot;
&quot; in one or more currencies , special loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts to pay this dial are to be paid directly to the organization that it reserves .
&quot; each transaction loan is to be interpreted by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which the source of the funds is given . &quot;
&quot; the proceeds from any transaction loans can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services that are made in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , the members of the organization and which , according to what the administrator has set at the time of the loan granted , could be a recipient of a transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital re@@ payments from a special transaction are transferred to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this way in the currency of a member state is to be returned to the Member State as soon as possible from the administrator to the Member State concerned . &quot;
&quot; until complete awar@@ ding of all the transaction loans , the Administrator informs the EEC about the purposes and programs approved by the directors in preparation for the inspection by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of payment of the special transactions loan , the ste@@ war@@ der noti@@ fies the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the special loans and the expendi@@ tures made for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible after the end of the financial year , the administrator has transferred the EEC to a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audi@@ tor of the organization for this account statement . &quot;
&quot; following full payment of the transaction loans , the administrator of the EEC shall submit a detailed account of the projects and programs financed by the special transaction account as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and exec@@ utes appropriate records and invoices , from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which account from the accounts recei@@ vable to the account received and issued from the account , and the re@@ payments to the Member States . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker are working closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker until the complete edition of the funds of the special transaction @-@ account from time to time provide an exchange of ideas about the state of the special transaction account , the continuation of programmes or projects financed by special transactions , and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organization may agree , did not come into force , the agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it are invalid with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the total amount of the total capital of all eligible loans in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this agreement has been rep@@ aid and transferred to the Member States , this agreement and all the obligations of the parties resulting from it are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC as per the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States are not@@ ing the conclusion of the procedures concerned by the Council of the European Communities .
the Sec@@ retariat heads these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC to the Organization .
&quot; this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month , which follows the date of receipt of the mentioned notification in the organization . &quot;
&quot; this agreement is written in two documents in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement is concluded in the form of a letter change to change the An@@ nex A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) , HA@@ T issue the following declaration : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called Eur@@ atom , represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Federal Council , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET Project ( J@@ ET Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation are referred to by a Common European Company pursuant to Section V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Enterprise J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years Switzerland has been involved in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , and is well acquainted with the area concerned . &quot;
&quot; because up to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion still carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the contracting parties of the present agreement to summ@@ ari@@ ze their relevant efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research , which gained a higher priority level due to the energy crisis &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable any contracting party to take the greatest possible benefit by pooling their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physi@@ cs to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and , accordingly , the common objective of this research work , i.e. the cost @-@ effective competitive electricity generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes defined in An@@ nex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Eur@@ atom Programme &quot; and &quot; Schweizer Programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss programme takes over long @-@ term goals and forms of co @-@ operation of the Eur@@ atom program ; it will be extended or amended by the organs mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present Convention , which may include new activities relevant to the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; each time the contractual parties accept a new program , this program will take place in An@@ nex I and II of the programmes presented in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
the association fores@@ een in paragraph 1 is realised by : - appropriate participation of each of the contracting parties during the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of staff among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom Member States , Switzerland and third countries with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories that work on the Eur@@ atom program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programs .
&quot; as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement provided in Article 2 , 1 of this agreement , the contracting parties conclude an association agreement , herein@@ after called &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those concluded between the Commission and the States and individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associations organs , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is taking part in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange between the Commission and the associated organs , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET Project , Switzerland is a member of the Joint Business J@@ ET , with the date of entry into force of the present agreement , its constitution accepts it . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract whose goal falls within the framework of the present agreement , with the exception of association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the validity period of the present agreement . &quot;
the bodies responsible for carrying out the association provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement are described in Articles 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , must include the suspension of a steering committee , the responsible representative of the Commission and the Federal Council . &quot;
- to monitor the development of research work and to steer so that the best possible results are achieved in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program - referred to in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; VG , which has to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters relating to current or planned programmes and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom program , applies this task to all research and development activities relating to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes cooperation and coordination between the associated organs and aims to establish a common objective in the interests of both parties in the Eur@@ atom program and in the Swiss programme as well as to the common goal established in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world are taken into account . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG appoint one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the Advisory Groups , which allow the VG research proposals to provide the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom program , take up this task with regard to all research and development work which is refer@@ enced in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; as part of the Eur@@ atom program , Switzerland is represented by the Director of one of the participating laboratories . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors , which is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , and which is responsible for ensuring that the capacities of the laboratories that are involved in the work carried out within the scope of the programme , are responsible for all research and development work which fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program and the Swiss program . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordin@@ ating committees used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program .
&quot; the coordination committees , which provide appropriate suggestions for the best possible use of resources , personnel as well as knowledge and skills of the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom program , take up this task in the respective area with regard to all research and development work which fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F belongs to the core and energy research representative of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any associated third country . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advises the Commission on the implementation of the programme and possible changes in the exec@@ utions as well as in preparing the future programs and determining its overall size , coordination and integration of national activities at Community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the opinions of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Director of Directors , the advisory groups and the coordination committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the statement of the VG to the urgent actions is mandatory ; the same applies to the committee of directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two contracting parties work on the works of all technical advisory bodies or all administrative bodies created for the purposes of the present agreement .
&quot; according to this agreement , Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to the Eur@@ atom program is set annually to an amount equal to the share of the Eur@@ atom program in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Switzerland to the total gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Market as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Switzerland out@@ points the common company J@@ ET to set up an amount according to the provisions of the Stat@@ ute of this Common Market . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom provides for the financing of work within the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis that is normally used to calculate Eur@@ atom &apos;s contributions to the financing of the works that are made due to the corresponding tre@@ aties . &quot;
the Commission will inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year which amount is intended to cover expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom program for the respective year .
the Federal Council shall pay the commission due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15 .
July . the remaining payment methods for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are set in An@@ nex III to the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland takes all necessary measures to allow Eur@@ atom to be exemp@@ t from customs duties or other duties , as well as from import ban and restrictions , to the part of the items financed by Eur@@ atom , which are to be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland , or items acquired there may not be utter@@ ed free of charge in this country , unless stipul@@ ated by the Federal Council . &quot;
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to he@@ y@@ men and cad@@ res who are paid to these individuals .
&quot; the provisions on access to the knowledge provided for the association provided in Article 2 , 1 of this Agreement shall be governed in Article 14 and 15 of this agreement , in the association agreement and in the agreement on the exchange of personnel . &quot;
the provisions on access to the knowledge that apply to Switzerland &apos;s participation in the Joint Business J@@ ET are regulated in Article 14 of this agreement and in the statutes of the Common Company .
the right of any contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an integral part of this agreement .

agreement in the form of an exchange between the European Economic Community and the Bank for International Sett@@ lements on the mobili@@ zation of the demands of the Member States within the framework of the medium @-@ term financial assistance
&quot; the BI@@ S could conclude Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries , when the banks face a corresponding application . &quot;
&quot; the agreement could be concluded until the total amount of the contribution paid by the credi@@ tor country to the mechanism paid by the credi@@ tor , namely within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion accounting units ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future delivery funds of the member states . &quot;
&quot; already now , however , some conditions are mentioned below , for which the BI@@ S would be ready . &quot;
&quot; with each stand@@ by credit , the BI@@ S would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of extensions , without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans , as well as for its extension , the BI@@ S would calculate a credit opening commission . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first draws should not be made before the end of a month after completion of the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the drawing would be made in the currencies available at the end of the agreement , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods which would be taking into account the means of the Bank , presumably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those who the BI@@ S apply at the time on under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market sentences . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BI@@ S has to obtain the necessary funds itself on the market , then the interest rate applicable to the application could reach a maximum corresponding to the Li@@ bor increased by a corresponding margin . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would like to share with me the approval of the Council of the European Communities .
the BI@@ S could conclude Stand@@ by credit agreements with the central banks of the credi@@ tor countries when the banks face a corresponding application .

&quot; the conclusion of the Convention by the Community brings - without prejudi@@ ce to the legal acts , which it leaves later - no expansion of the exclusive jurisdiction of the community . &quot;
&quot; due to the special situation of Greenland with regard to the natural conditions of the country and the living conditions of the local population , Greenland should be exemp@@ t from the scope of use of the Convention - &quot;

&quot; remembering the increasingly growing value of wild animals from environmentally @-@ related , ecological , genetic , scientific , aesthetic , free @-@ time , cultural , educational , social and economic point of view ; &quot;
&quot; in particular concern for those kinds of wild animals , the hikes across national jurisdiction , or outside the same undertaking ; &quot;
&quot; recognizing that States must and must be the prot@@ ectors of the wander@@ ing animal species , who live or tra@@ verse in their national jurisdiction ; &quot;
&quot; in the belief that maintenance as well as effective le@@ ge and use of mig@@ rating animal species require common action of all states , in whose national jurisdiction these types spend a part of their life cycle ; &quot;

in the form of an exchange between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic about the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb .
&quot; I honour the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to set out provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat from the Community . &quot;
&quot; - Fresh or cooled H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; under this agreement , the export opportunities for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina are set to the following annual amount : 20 000 tons , expressed in total weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is obliged to ensure that the agreed annual quantity does not exceed the agreed quantity and / or is carried out according to conventional forms of supply ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made possible as a result of changes in technology and commerce , the two parties of this agreement should consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee referred to under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community claims the safeguard clause , it ple@@ dges to ensure that the Argent@@ inian access to the common market has not been affected by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion of products made by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st set of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community changes the amount specified under number 2 in consultation with Argentina according to the extent of Argent@@ ine trade with each new member state . &quot;
&quot; the import duty for these new Member States is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ ment of the exhaus@@ tion is taken into account under number 5 . &quot;
&quot; the total amount mentioned under number 2 will be set on the day of the accession of Greece to the Community , to a total of 23 000 tonnes of slaugh@@ ter@@ house weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to prevent market development , which could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb in the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community is making provisions so that the sales of intervention states on frozen meat are not under@@ mining due to the implementation of the regulation the sales of Argent@@ ine@@ an H@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of lamb and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering determined living sheep and lam@@ bs must be accor@@ ded to the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms are interpreted in a manner compatible with the XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 letter c ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the Universal Custom@@ s and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; in order to comply with this agreement , Argentina will ensure that the quantities of export lic@@ ences specified under number 1 are granted within the quantities specified in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Community comm@@ its itself to meet all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the submission of an export license , which is assigned by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ ine@@ an government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in a way that the position of a security deposit can be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the products .
&quot; in the execution regulations , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority in the competent authority of the Community regul@@ ates the amounts given to the export lic@@ ences at regular intervals ; these data may be de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed according to the destination country . &quot;
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; he regularly examines the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat market of the two parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions which are of importance for the above @-@ mentioned target . &quot;

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I commend myself to take reference to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations regarding the import of amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep economy and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are exist@@ ential after the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , and that it is necessary to ensure that the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not affected in these markets , I bid to propose the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - Fresh or cooled H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat &apos;s meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , New Zealand is ensured for amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat of access to the market of the community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
&quot; in New Zealand , the assurance that the normal sales of his H@@ amm@@ el and lamb should not be affected by the use of the regulation . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure flaw@@ less functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is committed to ensuring that the set @-@ up quantity does not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the pre@@ defined quantities are carried out in conventional forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand is not to be prevented from using new technological developments or maintaining its competitiveness on the market of the community .
&quot; should a change in the offer form be made possible as a result of changes in technology and commerce , the two contractual parties consult each other before introducing such a change in the committee referred to in clause 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the Community claims the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion of products made by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st set of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the community in consultation with New Zealand will change the amounts specified in clause 2 according to the volume of New Zealand trading with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import duty for these new Member States is determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the Ho@@ ech@@ st@@ ment of the exhaus@@ tion mentioned in clause 5 is taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total amount mentioned in clause 2 will be set on the day of the accession of Greece to the Community , to a total of 2@@ 45 500 tons of total weight . &quot;
&quot; the community under@@ takes everything to prevent market development , which could compromise the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the joint market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community is making provisions so that the sales of intervention states on frozen meat are not under@@ mining due to the implementation of the Regulation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of creative work in the community without danger to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other promotion measures for the export of lamb and lamb as well as from slaugh@@ tering determined living sheep and lam@@ bs must be accor@@ ded to the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand ensures compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 , in particular that it does not grant export lic@@ ences to these quantities . &quot;
&quot; the community comm@@ its itself to make all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products is made dependent on the submission of an export license , which is granted by the authority appointed by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in a way that the position of a security deposit can be wai@@ ved for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the products .
&quot; in the implementation provisions , the responsible New Zealand authority in the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals informs the amounts given to the export lic@@ ences ; these data may be conclu@@ sively en@@ code according to the country of destination . &quot;
the committee is responsible for ensuring that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; the Committee regularly checks the tendency of the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb , and goat meat market of the two contracting parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions which are of importance for the clause 7 mentioned in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the committee is responsible for ensuring that the proper application of the agreement is not affected by the fact that products made from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat under the agreement will not be carried out according to the collective agreement . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall discuss all questions arising during the implementation of the agreement , which are presented to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this agreement apply without prejudi@@ ce to the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; the annual quantity stipul@@ ated in clause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount , which is applicable from the entry into force of this agreement , is determined in proportion to the total annual amount . &quot;

&quot; this agreement enters into force on 20 October 1980 . after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year . in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by both parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes they consider necessary . &quot;
&quot; I honor me , if your government can agree to the above that this letter and your reply will form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot;
&quot; I commend myself to take reference to the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations regarding the import of amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the community in connection with the application of the regulation on a common market organisation for H@@ amm@@ el - , lamb - and goat meat . &quot;

&quot; the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form , according to the label , is at most one year after the last satisfactory degree of efficacy . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents based on the label is based on the results of feasibility studies ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosph@@ or pent@@ at@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg within 24 hours .
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solvents delivered with the dry re@@ agents ) will be added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided the re@@ agent continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy . &quot;

&quot; anti @-@ D Ser@@ a , who are determined for the use of object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ C serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons imm@@ uni@@ zed by the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ogen C of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with floo@@ ding of human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen C , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the C an@@ tigen . &quot;
these ser@@ a are therefore specific to the C @-@ an@@ tigen only when the tested blood cells are absorbed in a 0.@@ 9@@ % sal@@ ine solution .
the titanium of the anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on object carriers according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and no form of anti @-@ D ) must be mixed within 30 seconds of a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons imm@@ uni@@ zed by the an@@ tigen e of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 compared to C@@ c@@ dd@@ le@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on slides according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son ( and not included in any form anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
&quot; sera of specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ C and specific@@ ity anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood of immun@@ ised individuals , or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum . &quot;
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time as defined by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a serum for use on object carriers is determined according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ating time should not be lower in all types of red blood cells , which show a reaction , not less than with the proportion@@ ate antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by blood cells or specific substances of group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB including sub @-@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A2@@ B ; it ag@@ glut@@ inate no human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;

&quot; if anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with a same amount of a 5@@ - to 10 % in@@ undation of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2- and A2@@ B blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur at any in@@ undation in double time , which is required if the same experiment is performed with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the anti @-@ A blood group serum or a standard preparation of the same avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B serum is extracted from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
&quot; anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ inate no human red blood cells that do not contain B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A. &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding compar@@ ator , to ti@@ tr@@ ate with a floo@@ ding of group B blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;

&quot; based on Article 5 Par@@ agra@@ ph 1 of the Convention , &quot; Parties shall take all necessary measures &quot; to free the therapeutic substances provided by the other parties of human origin from all entrance fees ; &quot;
&quot; whereas , for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this release falls within the jurisdiction of the Community by which it has been established , which has the powers required to do so ; &quot;
&quot; from the time of its entry into force , this additional protocol is part of the Convention . from that point onwards a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention , without becoming the contracting party of the additional protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , to all States and the European Economic Community any acceptance or objection in the meaning of Article 2 and the timing of the entry into force of this additional protocol pursuant to Article 2 . &quot;

&quot; in DER awareness that the community has decided to strengthen the internal market within the action programme to strengthen the internal market as of 1 January 1988 , to introduce a unified administration paper , &quot;
&quot; in THE dig@@ ging that it is appropriate to simplify the convey@@ ance of goods traffic between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by the introduction of a single administrative document , &quot;
&quot; in THE purpose , that this Convention shall not be interpreted to the extent that it ent@@ ails the contracting parties from their obligations arising from other international conventions - &quot;
&quot; in this Convention , measures are set to simplify the convey@@ ance of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries and among the individual EF@@ TA countries ; for this purpose , a unified administration paper ( herein@@ after referred to as single agent ) shall be used for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) . &quot;
&quot; the form@@ alities associated with the goods traffic between the contracting parties are gro@@ unded by means of a single agent , for which im@@ prints are to be used according to the patterns in An@@ nex I to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; depending on the case , the Single Paper is used as a registration or paper for export , shipping or import . &quot;
&quot; - to carry out legal requirements in force in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed in the case of sole use of the single agent ; &quot;
&quot; - to be required by the parties , so that they may be able to arrive at the request of a benefit or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not hin@@ der the contracting parties , simplified procedures , even using data processing , in terms of further facil@@ itation of the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Simp@@ li@@ fied procedures can , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned are not subject to a customs office and the registration for these goods is not to be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the delivery of an incomplete application may be admitted . &quot;
&quot; in such cases , an application must subsequently be submitted , in which it can be submitted with the consent of the competent authorities for a periodi@@ c collection message within the period specified by these authorities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of paragraph 1 , it is possible to use instead of the consistency paper . &quot;

&quot; if necessary , the customs authority of the country of destination or the transit country may require a translation of the application to the official language or any of the official languages of this country . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) Sub@@ ject to paragraph 1 , the registration shall always be in one of the official languages of the import state if they are filed in this country by the use of other than that of the customs office of the export or departure country . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may use the necessary registration copies for each individual procedure section between the contracting parties , to which , if necessary , the necessary copies can be added to the author@@ isations of the form@@ alities in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 must not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
&quot; without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collective consi@@ gn@@ ments , however , the competent authorities can fores@@ ee that the provisions for export and dispatch processes can be transferred to one and the same pre @-@ print by means of the copies provided for these form@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the relevant authorities will be convinced as far as possible that the details contained in the copies of the registration in the individual proceedings are in agreement . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure a smooth revers@@ al between the contractual parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , the customs authorities of these countries establish themselves or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be completely or partially denied or rejected if the solic@@ ited country of the opinion is that the administrative assistance infr@@ ing@@ es its security , public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests or infr@@ inge operational , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;

&quot; to this end , the commission from the contracting parties is regularly informed of practical experience with the application of the Convention ; it speaks recommendations and summ@@ arises in cases after paragraph 3 . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) The Mi@@ xed Committee decides amendments to the annex@@ es to this Convention , as well as the facil@@ itation stated in Article 4 ( 3 ) of the last line of thought . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party accepted a resolution under the reservation of the constitutional requirements , the decision , provided that there is no date , shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following notification of the cancellation of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party shall take appropriate measures to ensure effective and well @-@ balanced implementation of this Convention , whereby the need to take into account the conveying obligations arising out of the goods traffic as far as possible and to supply satisfactory solutions compl@@ ying with the provisions of this Convention . &quot;

&quot; in THE scale that the development of the technology and the structures of international trade made significant changes to the Brussels Treaty on 15 December 1950 on the tari@@ ff of tari@@ ff for the import of goods into the tari@@ ff tari@@ ffs , &quot;
&quot; furthermore , IN THE purpose that the measure of differentiation required by the governments and the economy for tari@@ ff @-@ tari@@ ff and statistical purposes is currently far beyond the one contained in the plant to the aforementioned agreement , &quot;
&quot; in DER awareness that it is important to have accurate and comparable data in international trade negotiations , &quot;
&quot; in DER awareness that the harmon@@ ised system is to be used for freight rates and traffic statistics of various types of transport , &quot;
&quot; in DER weighing that the harmon@@ ised system is intended to be included as far as possible into the systems used in trade for the designation and encoding of the goods , &quot;
&quot; in THE dig@@ ging that the harmon@@ ised system should contribute to achieving a close correlation between the import and export trading statistics on the one hand and the production statistics on the other hand , IN DER awareness that a close correlation between the harmon@@ ised system and the international trade mark for foreign trade ( S@@ IT@@ C ) of the United Nations should be preserved , &quot;
&quot; in DER weighing that it is desirable to meet the requirements listed above by a combined tari@@ ff and statistical model , which is appropri@@ ated for use by the international trade parties involved , &quot;
&quot; it is important that it is important to ensure the adaptation of the harmon@@ ised system to the development of technology and the structures of international trade , &quot;
&quot; taking into account the work carried out by the Council for the Cooperation in the field of customs services for the harmon@@ ised system in this area , &quot;
&quot; in THE dig@@ ging that - although the above @-@ mentioned agreement has proved to be an effective instrument in order to achieve some of these objectives , the conclusion of a new international convention is the most suitable way to achieve the desired result - &quot;

&quot; the contracting parties of the agreement signed on 15 December 1950 in Brussels on the establishment of a council for cooperation in the field of customs , &quot;
&quot; it is desirable that on June 14 , 1983 , the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and encoding of the goods will enter into force on 1 January 1988 . &quot;
&quot; in THE dig@@ ging that , without a change in Article 13 of the aforementioned Convention , the date of entry into force of this Convention would remain in@@ secure - &quot;
&quot; in Article 13 of the International Convention on the Harmon@@ ised System for the designation and encoding of the goods in Brussels on 14 June 1983 , in the following &quot; Con@@ ventions , &quot; &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention enters into force on 1 January , following the date of at least three months after the date of which at least sevent@@ een of the States or customs or economic uni@@ on@@ ists signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication or have deposited their rati@@ fication or affili@@ ation documents , but not before January 1 , 1988 . &quot;
&quot; A.

&quot; however , only states or customs or economic uni@@ on@@ ists may post@@ p@@ one the certificate of acceptance of this Protocol , which have previously signed the Convention without reservation of rati@@ fication or at the same time sign or deposit their document on rati@@ fication or accession to the Convention . &quot;
&quot; B . each State and any Custom@@ s or Economic Union , the contracting party of the Convention after the entry into force of this Protocol pursuant to paragraph A , is the contracting party of the Convention in the amended version . &quot;
&quot; - a plant that is not only indispensable for the maintenance and maintenance of soils , but also allows the use of land that does not allow any other planting , and that even with extensive management , which makes the main part of today &apos;s production , is favorable to any improvement of cultivation methods , &quot;
&quot; under H@@ IN@@ WE@@ IS DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , that the existence and standard of living of millions of families depend on its cultivation , which in turn depends entirely on the measures taken to maintain and extend the consumption of olive products in the producer countries themselves and in non @-@ producing countries ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , olive oil and table olive oil are essential substances in the areas where olive cultivation is common ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to DA@@ RA@@ U@@ F , that the essential characteristic of olive production is the ir@@ regul@@ arity of harv@@ ests and market supply and that this leads to fluctuations in production , prices and export revenues as well as to very different producers of producers ; &quot;
