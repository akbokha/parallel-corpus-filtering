this document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) in which the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine .
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or your treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution for taking ( 1 mg / ml ) and an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. wir@@ l thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , mi@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , a mental illness in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high spirits ) alternating with periods of normal mood . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased un@@ rest or behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ b@@ ance if the oral intake of the drug is not possible .
&quot; in both cases , the solution for taking or the melting tablets can be applied to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this interfer@@ es with signal transmission between brain cells through &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l probably acts primarily as a &quot; partial agon@@ ist &quot; for the recept@@ ors for neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l acts as 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but in a lesser extent than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; since dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , which reduces psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and prevents its recur@@ rence . &quot;
the effectiveness of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent recur@@ rence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year .
the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo .
&quot; in another study Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo to prevent recur@@ rence of 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms had already been stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder , suffering from increased un@@ rest , compared to Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic drug ) and placebo over a period of two hours . &quot;
all studies examined the change in patients &quot; symptoms based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment .
the company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to take up ( absor@@ bs ) .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg or 15 mg , showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effectively than placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Abi@@ li@@ fy prevented the recur@@ rence of some episodes from previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses also significantly reduced the symptoms of increased un@@ rest and were similar to lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for taking ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( nausea ) , headache , blur@@ red vision , nausea , vom@@ iting ( increased sali@@ va production ) , fatigue and exhaus@@ tion , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder and in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke mostly of man@@ ic episodes , and in which the man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole versus the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , if oral therapy is not appropriate , out@@ weigh the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a license to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes on the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of the meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven , although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
&quot; the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once daily , regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group , a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after menop@@ ause , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no higher suicide risk with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; if signs and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occur in a patient treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , should be considered to reduce the dose or cancel treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a m@@ ns , or has un@@ clear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be dismissed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or at states associated with sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in patients with psych@@ oses associated with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of mortality compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there was in one of these studies , a study with a fixed dosage , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar@@ em coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic agents that allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorders , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , and may lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary effect of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally @-@ effective medicines with overl@@ apping side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C from Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole by 107 % , while the C@@ MA@@ X remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , such as flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ isers . &quot;
&quot; if you consider the joint gift of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should out@@ weigh the potential risks for the patient . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV @-@ prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dosage height before starting the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or Esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram ) or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 to be administered together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be calculated with a moderate increase in arith@@ me@@ tic concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole per day did not show a significant effect on the metabol@@ ism of the substrates of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine @-@ R@@ atio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ bo@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; due to the insufficient data situation for safety in humans and due to the concerns that arise in the animal reproduction studies , this drug may not be used in pregnancy , unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against using dangerous machines , including motor vehicles , until they are certain that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative impact on them . &quot;
the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - In a controlled long @-@ term study over 52 weeks in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , a total inferior incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , compared to patients treated with semi @-@ surgery ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 14,@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was 15.@@ 1 % in patients with ob@@ lon@@ zap@@ ine therapy . &quot;
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - In a controlled study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23@@ ,5 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under semi @-@ oper@@ as treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % was for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo .
&quot; comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; CP@@ K increases ( cre@@ atine ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy have been reported to include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ intended or deliber@@ ate over@@ doses were observed with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without deaths . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information about the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose , since Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole has a high plasma protein binding . &quot;
it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine di@@ - and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D and D@@ 3 receptor and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - , ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2@@ c@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ C , to alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , at Nu@@ cle@@ us cau@@ dat@@ us and on the put@@ ative . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
&quot; in a semi @-@ oper@@ and @-@ controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ dents in both groups were similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and Hal@@ li@@ dol 73 % ) in both groups . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg - depression rates , showed a significantly stronger recovery than in Hal@@ ki@@ li@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a significantly higher return rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an ob@@ long @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
&quot; in two placebo and active @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or semi @-@ surgery in week 12 . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole also showed in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of man@@ ia such as lithium or neck surgery .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which sometimes did not affect lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ ization , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reverse , mainly in preventing a decline in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzymes C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for the Deh@@ ydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ulation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , the N @-@ de@@ al@@ ky@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
the mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in extensive metabol@@ isers on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and about 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isers on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 .
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , and in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients did not show any gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a simulation @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not show clin@@ ically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study involving subjects with varying liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh class A , B and C ) showed no significant effect on liver function affecting the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but the study included only 3 patients with liver cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not allow any particular risks to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects contained a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average ste@@ ady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose for humans .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in g@@ all of monkeys after repeated oral dosing of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the Sul@@ ph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gate hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg found no more than 6 % of the concentrations stated in the study over 39 weeks in the G@@ alle of monkeys and lie far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro @-@ sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages that lead to ex@@ positions of 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean Ste@@ ady State AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; 15 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials lasting one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine di@@ - and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .

the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of the meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets may alternatively take the tablet tablets to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder has been reported in some cases after onset or after menop@@ ause , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; m@@ ns clinical manifestations are high fever , muscle rigi@@ dity , changing consciousness layers and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally seen in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and in patients with bi@@ polar disorders , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect , and may lead to serious complications . &quot;

the following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :
in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks .
&quot; 58 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which sometimes did not affect lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;

it is believed that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar I disorder is medi@@ ated by the combination of a partial agon@@ ist effect on dop@@ amine di@@ - and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1@@ - recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an ob@@ long @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar I disorder Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo .
&quot; in a relative bio@@ availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was compared with 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in tablet form in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geometric C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets was 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was established as a result of the precip@@ itation of sul@@ fate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l in the bile from 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;

Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used to quickly control det@@ oxi@@ fication and behavi@@ our@@ al problems in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; once it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution should be terminated and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in order to increase the absorption and to minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , an injection in the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended as a circum@@ vention of obes@@ e regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) may be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or ac@@ utely ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if an oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy , or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
there are no investigations on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution in patients with a@@ thei@@ sm and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders that were otherwise caused by schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar I disorder .
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution as necessary , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
studies on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution are not available to patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( prescribed by prescribed or illegal medicines ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with well @-@ known cardiovascular disease ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , hyper@@ tension ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that pre@@ dispose for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ mia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including ac@@ cel@@ eri@@ zed and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical studies lasting one year or less there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia appearing during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole .
&quot; m@@ ns clinical manifestations are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing consciousness layers and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sy , poly@@ ur@@ ie , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally seen in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar disorder due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effect and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of se@@ dation was greater compared to the dose of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study where healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dosage ) were applied as one @-@ time intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and the simultaneous Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dosage ) intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist fam@@ ot@@ ine , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically ir@@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabol@@ isers , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 extensively metabol@@ isers . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dos@@ ages should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; after replacing the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ or , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be raised to the dosage height before starting the accompanying therapy . &quot;

the following side effects were more common in clinical studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of side effects listed below is defined according to the following criteria : common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
107 The following side effects were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical trials ( see Section 5.1 ) :
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks , the incidence of EPS 19 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % was for those under lithium treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term maintenance phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18.@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole was treated and 15.@@ 7 % for patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and placebo , where potentially clin@@ ically significant changes of rout@@ inely controlled laboratory parameters occurred , did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences . &quot;
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ at@@ in@@ ph@@ osp@@ ho@@ kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed at 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; adverse events associated with anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy have been reported to include mal@@ ig@@ ne neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and sei@@ zur@@ es , un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al distur@@ b@@ ance was the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvement of ti@@ ghtness / behavi@@ our@@ al problems compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as a@@ thei@@ sm and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in symptoms of a@@ thei@@ sm and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference arm . &quot;
&quot; the mean improvement from bas@@ eline value on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9.@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub @-@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe ag@@ gra@@ vation , a similar efficacy was observed in relation to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be detected due to a reduced number of patients . &quot;
in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) of 1.@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo .
&quot; in a semi @-@ oper@@ and controlled study , 52 % of respon@@ dents in both groups were similar ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and Hal@@ ki@@ li@@ dol 73 % in both groups . &quot;
&quot; current values from measurement scales defined as secondary study targets , including P@@ AN@@ SS and the Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression rate , showed a significantly stronger recovery than in Hal@@ ki@@ li@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks in stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole ( oral ) showed a significantly higher return rate of 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % in placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an ob@@ long @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , which included 3@@ 14 patients and in which the primary study target &apos; weight gain &apos; was , in significantly fewer patients a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to the bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg at an average weight of ca . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic symptoms , which were partly not based on lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy in therapeutic serum levels , the companion therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior effectiveness in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study in man@@ ic patients who had achieved re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase before random@@ isation , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed himself superior to the prevention of a bi@@ polar reverse , mainly in preventing a decline in the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular inj@@ ections , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger the AU@@ C after administration of the same dose as tablet ; the systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations . &quot;
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy subjects , the average time to reach the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole injection solution was tolerated by rats and monkeys , resulting in no direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated dose with a systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 times over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , no safety @-@ relevant concerns arose after mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ times ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum human @-@ therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and the carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not allow any particular risks to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were observed only in doses or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; they have limited or no meaning for clinical use . &quot;
the effects contained a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal cell loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans .

&quot; the effectiveness of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a main study where 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer participated , of which about three quarters earlier had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in some administration and as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the drug containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; overall , 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane were eligible for treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients containing conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; if one considers the patients who were first treated for metastatic breast cancer for the first time , there was no difference between the medicines in relation to efficacy indicators such as time to the deterioration of the disease and survival . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , patients who had previously received other treatments of their metastatic breast cancer showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
it may not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood or at the beginning of the treatment .
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients with whom the first treatment was no longer considered to be more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel and that it does not have to be given with other medicines in contrast to other pac@@ lit@@ axel in order to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients with the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease and is not indicated for standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing treatment ( see also section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ phy number &lt; 0,@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy , the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series . &quot;
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 , treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is reached on degrees 1 or 2 , and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles . &quot;
there are currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with mild to moderate liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies were conducted with patients with impaired ren@@ al function and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose adjustments in patients with impair@@ ment of the ren@@ al function ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bon@@ ded nan@@ op@@ articles formulation of pac@@ lit@@ axel which could have much other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately removed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated , and the patient must not be treated with pac@@ lit@@ axel again . &quot;
&quot; in patients , no new Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles should be initiated until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils is increased to &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has risen again to &gt; 100 x 109 / l . &quot;
patients with severe liver function problems ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; while the cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity that was clearly associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane has not been proven , cardiac incidents in the indicated patient population are not unusual , especially in patients with previous anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or pul@@ mon@@ ary disease . &quot;
&quot; if the patients receive nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea after the dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and cont@@ acting means . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used for pregnant women or women in child@@ bearing age , which do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , except for the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ ep@@ tive method during and up to 1 month after treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane will be advised , during and up to six months after the treatment no child is to bear . &quot;
male patients should consult a sperm @-@ conservation before the treatment because the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects such as ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) that can affect per@@ spir@@ ation and ability to operate machines .
the following are the most common and most important incidents of adverse events reported in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were treated once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane once every three weeks .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most striking important hem@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of the patients .
an@@ a@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 lists the side effects associated with the dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy at each dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) ; rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , elevated blood sugar , elevated blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood heart diseases : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , blo@@ ating , tongue burning , dry mouth , painful to@@ g@@ ums , loose stools , o@@ es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , sor@@ es in the mouth , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of muscles , head@@ aches , gro@@ in pain , muscle sp@@ as@@ ms , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very common : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a definitive in context in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection with these events was established . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules compound that promotes the contra@@ ction of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabil@@ ises mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their de@@ modul@@ arization .
&quot; this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ular network , which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions . &quot;
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cy@@ to@@ sis of plasma components into end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the course of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel with end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
it is assumed that this improved transc@@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated by the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor and occurs due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( secre@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) in the area of the tumor .
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data of 106 patients in two single @-@ armed un@@ obstruc@@ ted studies and 4@@ 54 patients who were treated in a random@@ ized Phase III comparative study .
&quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion of more than 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of over 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
this multi@@ center study was conducted in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received a mon@@ otherapy with pac@@ lit@@ axel for 3 weeks either in the form of solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 as a 3 @-@ hour in@@ fusion with prevention of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without prevention ( N = 2@@ 29 ) .
&quot; in the study 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ as@@ els . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy prior to chemotherapy , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % for metastatic disease and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
&quot; 9 The results for the general response rate and time until progression of the disease , as well as progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are shown below . &quot;
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity versus pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced an peripheral Neu@@ rop@@ athy degree 3 at a time during the therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy at bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the overall pac@@ lit@@ axel according to 30@@ - and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was measured in clinical studies .
the active exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased lin@@ early from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 .
10 Accor@@ ding to intraven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer at the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentrations commen@@ ced in a multi@@ phase mode .
the mean distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume refers to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or distance connection of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; in a study with patients with advanced solid tumours , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with values following a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; after the dose of a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel , the clear@@ ance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) than after a solvent containing pac@@ lit@@ axel , and also the distribution volume was higher at Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue coating it is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel in the first line is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed to 6@@ α -@@ Hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ure@@ tic ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , indicating a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearing . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available for patients at the age of more than 75 years , since only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability has been detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in original box and in light light over 8 hours .

&quot; if it is not immediately used , it can be stored in the water bottle for up to 8 hours in the refrigerator ( 2 ° C - 8 ° C ) , when stored in the cart@@ on to protect the contents from light . &quot;
&quot; each bottle contains 100 mg of pac@@ lit@@ axel . • After the re@@ constitution , every ml of Sus@@ pension contains 5 mg Pac@@ lit@@ axel . • The other component is alb@@ umin@@ ate of people ( contains sodium , sodium cap@@ r@@ yl@@ ate and N acet@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han ( Ph@@ .@@ Eur@@ . ) ) &quot;
precau@@ tions for the preparation and use of pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be taken care of when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe should be inj@@ ected slowly over a period of 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion fluid into an Abra@@ x@@ ane gas bottle .
&quot; after that , turn the flas@@ hing bottle for at least 2 minutes slowly and carefully and / or in@@ vert until complete res@@ us@@ board of the powder is done . &quot;
&quot; for the patient , the exact total dose volume of 5 mg / ml Sus@@ pension can be calculated and the corresponding amount of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane is inj@@ ected into an empty , sterile PVC in@@ fusion bag type IV . &quot;
&quot; prior to the application of a visual inspection , par@@ enter@@ al medicines should be subjected to possible particles and disc@@ olo@@ ur@@ ation whenever the solution or the container allow this . &quot;

&quot; stability of the re@@ constituted suspension in the pier@@ cing flas@@ k After the first re@@ constitution , the suspension should immediately be filled into an in@@ fusion bag . &quot;
member states must ensure that the owner of the licence for placing on the market before the market launch will provide medical professionals in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail outlets with the following information and materials :
&quot; • Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the drug ( specialist information ) , lab@@ eling and packing expenses . • With clear picture presentation of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for transport through the patient . &quot;
&quot; this means that Ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same ingredient ( also known as &quot; reference drug &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood li@@ mes@@ cale values , in cases where blood trans@@ fusion could occur , if a blood loss is not possible prior to the procedure and a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a self @-@ blood donation , Ab@@ se@@ amed is to be inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
&quot; the injection can also be performed by the patient or his care@@ gi@@ ver , provided that they have received appropriate instructions . &quot;
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always be in the recommended range ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults and between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
the iron values of all patients must be checked before treatment to ensure that no iron deficiency exists and iron supplements should be administered throughout the entire treatment .
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia can be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ id deficiency or that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thus reduce the consequences of a loss of blood .
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which em@@ powers them to the formation of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
&quot; in the course of a major study with 4@@ 79 patients who suffered from kidney problems , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference doctor . &quot;
all patients participating in this study were inj@@ ected at least eight weeks before E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o was inj@@ ected into a vein before they were either switched to Ab@@ se@@ amed or continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o .
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the start of the study and the evaluation period between 25 and 29 weeks .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of under @-@ skin spra@@ yed Ab@@ se@@ amed with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o were examined at 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study with patients who suffered from kidney problems caused an@@ emia , the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values of patients who were converted to Ab@@ se@@ amed were maintained in the same measure as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , patients who still received E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of the output value of 12,@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effect of Ab@@ se@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which can occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
Ab@@ se@@ amed may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; Ab@@ se@@ amed as inj@@ ections under the skin is not recommended for treating kidney problems , as further studies are required to ensure that no allergic reactions are triggered . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ se@@ amed according to the regulations of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ yp@@ o . &quot;

&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / l &#93; , no iron deficiency ) , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or insufficient , in case of planned larger surgical procedures which require a large volume of blood ( 4 or more units blood in men ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ se@@ amed can be applied in front of a large elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic surgery in adults without iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion @-@ related complications can be expected . &quot;
H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml which cannot participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program .
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except pedi@@ atric patients whose hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and result may vary depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical history and condition of disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increased by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed in one patient or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increases by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month , or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used in the lowest permitted dose which is required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia symptoms .
the present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with whom initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the present clinical findings suggest that patients with initially very low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients with whom initial an@@ a@@ emia is less pronounced ( H@@ b &gt; 6.@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; starting dose 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week by an intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in steps of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms of an@@ emia and symptoms may differ depending on age , gender and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical history and condition of disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; given this hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be tried to reach the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6,@@ 2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest permitted dose , which is required for controlling an@@ emia symptoms . &quot;
&quot; if after 4 weeks of treatment of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the cy@@ te @-@ cy@@ te number increased by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the bas@@ eline value , the dose of 150 I.@@ U. / kg should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the number of patients &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the number of patients &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the cy@@ te @-@ cy@@ te number by ≥ 40,000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the cy@@ te @-@ cy@@ te number increased by &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l / l versus the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ emia ( ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ it 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary deposit of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ta@@ ves is required , should receive Ab@@ se@@ amed in a dose of 600 I.@@ U. / kg of body weight twice a week for 3 weeks prior to the surgical procedure . &quot;
iron sub@@ stitution should begin as early as possible - for example a few weeks before the start of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - large iron reserves are available before the start of the se@@ amed therapy .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa pre@@ oper@@ atively should be given 300 I.@@ U. / kg each 10 consecutive days , on the day of the intervention and 4 days immediately afterwards . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection can be given at the end of di@@ aly@@ sis via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula needle , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure adequate injection of the drug in the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from treatment with some ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin at an ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ con@@ ia ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) should not receive a se@@ amed or other ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin ( see section 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ con@@ ia ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within a month prior to the treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis ( e.g. an@@ am@@ n@@ estic ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the application of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are not able to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of cardi@@ opul@@ mon@@ ary or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with recently occurred heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular event . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ con@@ ia ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare has been reported on the appearance of a pre @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; patients with sudden loss of effects , defined as a reduction in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , should be investigated and the usual causes for failure ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , aluminium toxic@@ ity , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) . &quot;
&quot; if the cy@@ te @-@ cy@@ te value , taking into account an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the &quot; &quot; Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ bites &quot; &quot; Index ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cytes are normal , and if no other reason for a loss of effects is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an investigation of the bone mar@@ row will be considered to diagnose a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data for immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of Ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk of anti@@ static @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk for serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7,5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit due to the gift of epo@@ et@@ ines when hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration required to control an@@ emia symptoms and the avoid@@ ance of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in increase should be approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month to minimize the risk of increasing blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and clinical evidence of cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive in@@ suffici@@ ency , the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded in maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ liable , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
tumour patients receiving chemotherapy should include a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response ( patients who may need to be trans@@ fun@@ ded ) for the assessment of the efficacy of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa .
if the H@@ b increase is exceeded than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8.@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) the dose must be adjusted in accordance with Section 4.2 ( see section 4.2 Treatment of patients with chemotherapy @-@ induced an@@ emia - dose adjustment with the aim of keeping the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) .
the decision to use re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on benefits @-@ risk weighing taking part in the patient &apos;s involvement that should also take into account the specific clinical context .
&quot; in patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic operation , if possible , the cause of an@@ a@@ emia should be investigated prior to the beginning of epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy . &quot;
&quot; patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ edic operation should have adequate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially in the underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be excluded that with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa treatment for patients with an output threshold of &gt; 13 g / dl an increased risk of post @-@ post thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ et@@ ine has not been proven that tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia will improve overall survival or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;

&quot; epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , to control the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in and adjust the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose to the increasing ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ it . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies on tumor tissues , there is no indication of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;
&quot; thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic , vascular events such as m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial isch@@ em@@ ias , m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events ( cereb@@ ral ha@@ em@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge , cereb@@ ral inf@@ ar@@ ction ) , arter@@ ial thro@@ mb@@ oses , pul@@ mon@@ ary thro@@ mb@@ oses , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , arter@@ ial thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis , ather@@ os@@ clerosis . &quot;
the most common side effect during the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or worsen@@ ing of an existing hyper@@ tension .
an increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vas@@ cul@@ ary events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations may lead to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
the techn@@ ologically derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ ulated and is identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content identical to the endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin that was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients .
&quot; with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulated the ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and did not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis . &quot;

&quot; in 1895 , patients with solid tumours ( 6@@ 83 breast cancer , 260 bron@@ chi@@ al cancer , 17@@ 4 gy@@ na@@ ecological tum@@ ors , 300 gastro@@ intestinal tum@@ ors and 4@@ 78 others ) and 80@@ 2 patients with hem@@ ost@@ bla@@ sts . &quot;
survival and progression progression were studied in five major controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these studies were double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
&quot; in the open study , there was no difference in overall survival between patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin and the patient &apos;s patients . &quot;
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin showed an un@@ clari@@ fied , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality rate than with the controls due to various common malign@@ ancies . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treated patients and in controls .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be ruled out . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the application of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin in tumour patients treated with chemotherapy with the aim of reaching a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value below 13 g / dl , since too few patients with these characteristics were included in the reviewed data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ determin@@ ations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa serum levels are much lower than serum levels that are obtained after intraven@@ ous inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; there is no accumulation : the serum levels remain the same regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift , or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a well known complic@@ ation of chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in humans and might be due to a secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study on hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients who were treated three years with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients who were not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; in animal experimental studies with nearly 20 times the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced f@@ ö@@ tal body weight , a delay of os@@ si@@ fication and an increase in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports support in vitro diagnostic findings with cells from human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; as part of the out@@ patient application , the patient can store Ab@@ se@@ amed for a period of up to 3 days outside the cooling case and not over 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the sy@@ ring@@ es are provided with gradu@@ ation rings and the filling volume is indicated by a past@@ ed label , so if necessary , the measurement of partial quantities is possible . &quot;
the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed has to be initiated under the supervision of doctors who have experience in the treatment of patients with the above indications .
&quot; 21 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once weekly over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( day 0 ) . &quot;
23 In patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in maintenance therapy the upper limit of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration should not be exceeded .

&quot; during the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed it can occur within the normal range to a slight dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood counts , which re@@ forms with further treatment . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will carry out regular blood tests to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; lack of iron , dissolution of the red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12@@ - or fo@@ lic acid deficiency , should be taken into account and treated with se@@ amed before starting the therapy . &quot;
very rare was reported about the appearance of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sto@@ con@@ ia after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ sts , it will break down your therapy with Ab@@ se@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best handled . &quot;
therefore Ab@@ se@@ amed must be given by injection to a vein ( intraven@@ ously ) if you are treated for an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease .
&quot; a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value can be the risk of problems with the heart or blood vessels , and the risk of dying could be increased . &quot;
&quot; with elevated or offensive levels of potassium , your doctor may take an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed until the potassium values lie back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or in@@ con@@ ges@@ tion by insufficient heart performance , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges with Ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis @-@ liable , does not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa and the desired effect should be taken into account for evaluating the effectiveness of Ab@@ se@@ amed .
200 your doctor will regularly determine your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your Ab@@ se@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) .
&quot; this risk should be weighed very carefully compared to the advantages derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or pul@@ mon@@ ary em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are a cancer patient , consider that Ab@@ se@@ amed works like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can adver@@ sely affect the tumor . &quot;
&quot; if you have a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined before the course of treatment with Ab@@ sor@@ amed . &quot;
&quot; if your values of red blood dy@@ e ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive Ab@@ se@@ amed , as there is an increased risk of blood graf@@ ting after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; if you take C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( Medium to supp@@ ress the immune system ) during your treatment with Ab@@ se@@ amed , your doctor may arrange certain blood tests to measure blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have shown no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are a means to build up the immune system , for example cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia ( an@@ emia ) appeals to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of the treatment and ensure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; once you are well set , you will receive regular doses of Ab@@ se@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;

&quot; to ensure this and ensure that the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will regularly carry out regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of the surgery and another 4 days after the surgery . &quot;

A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease causing the bones to be br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high frac@@ ture risk ( frac@@ tures ) , including patients who have recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture as in the cervi@@ x ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice a day for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should receive a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 I@@ U ) before the first in@@ fusion or through injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce the symptoms appearing in the three days after in@@ fusion , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta may only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used for evaluation of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in the first study , nearly 8 000 elderly women were involved in o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of spinal and hip frac@@ tures was examined over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently suffered hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures over a period of up to five years was examined .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two trials involving 3@@ 57 patients and compared with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ at ( another bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was whether the content of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that builds bone substance ) in the blood was norm@@ alized , or at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; in the study with older women , the risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( without other o@@ steopor@@ osis ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without o@@ steopor@@ osis ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
in the study with men and women with hip frac@@ ture 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of the patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) .
most A@@ cla@@ sta adverse events occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ents or any other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ sta are subject to the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta is prepared to prescri@@ be doctors who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis , which contains indications of how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients in which the side effects of the medicine are explained and referred to when they should contact the doctor . &quot;

intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men .
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks following the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after a treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta a long re@@ mission period was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is highly advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by applying par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta .
&quot; patients with kidney dysfunction ( see Section 4.4 ) In patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min , A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience is available for this patient group . &quot;
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and adolescents A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age as data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness are missing .
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) , because only limited clinical experience is available for this patient population . &quot;
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia is treated with A@@ cla@@ sta before the beginning of the therapy with sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; because of the rapid onset of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid on the bone structure , a temporary , occasionally asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , poor oral hygiene , should be considered a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment before using bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; for patients who need dental surgery , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of treatment with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
clinical assessment by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms occurring within the first three days after administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by applying par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
the frequency of severe side effects reported by atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation was increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 from 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3.@@ 8@@ 52 ) .
&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial &#91; R@@ FT &#93; ) was the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse drug interactions are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; kidney dysfunction Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was associated with kidney dysfunction , which referred to as a decrease in the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase of serum @-@ cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the transformation of the cre@@ atine @-@ in @-@ clear@@ ance ( measured annually before administration ) and the occurrence of ren@@ al failure as well as a limited ren@@ al function were comparable in a clinical study for o@@ steopor@@ osis over three years compared to the A@@ cla@@ sta@@ - and the placebo group .
a temporary increase in serum Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ins within 10 days of the dose was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta versus 0.@@ 8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on the assessment of the laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium levels , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation range ( less than 2,@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were observed in 2.3 % of the patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies . &quot;
&quot; in addition , all patients received sufficient amounts of vitamin D and calcium in the study for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis , in the study to prevent clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local responses after the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in a large clinical study was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis in the max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial area has been reported , especially in cancer patients , about o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ro@@ sis ( primarily in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ei@@ c acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections , including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and the majority of reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extrac@@ tions or other dental procedures . &quot;
&quot; 7 study with 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients performed o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose in the oral part of an A@@ cla@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; in the case of over@@ dose , which leads to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , a compensation of oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate can be achieved . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7,@@ 7@@ 36 females aged 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the Sch@@ enk@@ el@@ h@@ eck ≤ -@@ 2,5 with or without any signs of an existing verteb@@ ral frac@@ ture . &quot;
effects on morph@@ ometric spine frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and already after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated patients aged 75 years and older had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed an equal lasting effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in a 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect on bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar spine , hip and dist@@ al radius compared with placebo treatment significantly at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 % of the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine increased by 6.@@ 7 % , the total hip by 6.0 % , the fem@@ oral neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology In 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) one year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es from the basin .
a micro@@ computer@@ ized ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed an increase of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the tra@@ be@@ cular bone structure compared to placebo .
&quot; bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ terminal pro@@ pep@@ tide of the type I@@ - col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum were measured in sub@@ groups from 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periods of study duration . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cla@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to the bas@@ eline and was held at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the output value after 12 months and was held at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below output value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; the tot@@ ality lay at 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta , compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group . &quot;
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased the BM@@ D at all time points compared to placebo treatment .
&quot; over 24 months compared to placebo treatment , the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment increased by 5.@@ 4 % to the total th@@ igh and 4.3 % to the fem@@ oral neck . &quot;
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ised and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % at A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
in another study in men ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) the once annual administration of A@@ cla@@ sta was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline .
&quot; clinical efficacy of the treatment at the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cla@@ sta has been studied in patients and patients aged over 30 years with radi@@ ologically approved , especially light to moder@@ ately heavy Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone ( mean serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to 2.@@ 6@@ x to 3.@@ 0@@ x age @-@ specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) . &quot;
11 The efficacy of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid in comparison to the intake of 30 mg of Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once daily during 2 months was demonstrated in two six months comparative studies .
the combined results were observed after 6 months a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain control compared to the bas@@ eline for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate .
patients who were classified as respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 treated patients taking part in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic approach to 141 of the patients treated with Ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate could be maintained in a mean duration of the follow @-@ up phase of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; single and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid in 64 patients yiel@@ ded the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ independent . &quot;
&quot; after that , the plasma level rapidly increased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long period of very low concentration , not more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bi@@ pha@@ sic dis@@ appearing from the large cycle with half @-@ life cycles t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal eli@@ oration time t ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early distribution phases ( α and β ) represent the rapid absorption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
&quot; in the first 24 h , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bon@@ ded to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body @-@ clear@@ ance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2.5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by gender , age , race or body weight . &quot;
an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes led to decrease of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion but had no effect on the surface below the curve ( plasma concentration at time ) .
&quot; a decreased clear@@ ance of the metabol@@ ised substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or even no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , substance @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearing of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid cor@@ related with the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , namely 75 ± 33 % of the Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance , and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in 64 patients . &quot;
this results in an easy ( Cl@@ c@@ r = 50@@ - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al function distur@@ b@@ ance down to a cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ clearing up to 35 ml / min no dose adjustment of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid .
&quot; because there are only limited data for severe kidney dysfunction ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ le@@ thal intraven@@ ous dosage was 10 mg / kg of body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg of body weight .
&quot; in dogs , single doses of 1,@@ 0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C are 6 times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) , administered over a period of 15 minutes , well and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; sub@@ chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity In studies with intraven@@ ous application , the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid was administered in rats using doses of 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , a total of 6 times ( a cum@@ ulative dose equivalent to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies with repeated application in cum@@ ulated ex@@ positions that sufficiently exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure , toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and the intraven@@ ous injection point . &quot;
&quot; the most common finding in trials with repeated use was an increased primary sponge in the met@@ ap@@ hy@@ sis of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with almost all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti @-@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
rats observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as external and internal ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was defined at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the preparation and the conditions prior to the application ; normally , 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot;

&quot; in July 2007 , the Pharma @-@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the approval application is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
Ris@@ ko @-@ Management @-@ Plan The owner of the licensing agreement comm@@ its itself to conduct trials and additional activities on pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance in the pharmac@@ o@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.2 of the application and all subsequent versions of the MP approved version of the MP .
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Directive on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; a revised R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ ization ) was reached . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ utri@@ ents is a representative of a substance class called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the disease Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens formed from and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; at the patho@@ gen Pa@@ get , the bone structure becomes too fast , and new bone material is constructed un@@ ordered , which makes the bone material weaker than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta works by restoring bone structure back to normal , ensuring normal bone formation and rein@@ forcing the bone again . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo dental surgery , tell your doctor that you are treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you use A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines , please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use other medicines or have recently taken / applied , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs that are known to damage the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta together with food and beverages , please be careful that according to your doctor &apos;s instructions sufficient fluids will be taken before and after treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year , given to you by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion in a vein . &quot;
&quot; if you recently broke the hip , it is recommended to make the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after operating the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
the usual dose is 5 mg administered by your doctor or nursing staff as in@@ fusion into a vein .
&quot; since A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose after one year or more . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions closely so that the calcium level in your blood is not too low in time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work longer than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a re @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta has been missed , get in touch with your doctor or hospital immediately to arrange a new appointment . &quot;
&quot; before you end the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta If you are considering stopping the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please take your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss it with your doctor . &quot;
&quot; side effects related to the first in@@ fusion often occur ( in more than 30 % of patients ) , but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently , it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should report it to your doctor if you notice such symptoms when you have received A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs due to a too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; swelling , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , fatigue , ting@@ ling , di@@ zz@@ iness , pain in the eyes , heart@@ break , pain in the eyes , heart@@ break , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation , irrit@@ ation . &quot;
persistent pain and / or healing wounds in the mouth or in the jaw were mainly reported in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates because of other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , has been reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or notice any side effects that are not listed in this information information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions until the application ; normally , 24 hours should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot;
patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture are advised to carry out the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks following the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture .
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be sufficiently hydr@@ ated ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic treatment . &quot;
&quot; because of the rapid en@@ roll@@ ment of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ ic acid on the bone structure , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic per@@ fusion of hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is very advisable to ensure adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , according to at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the gift of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ E. or@@ alem or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about your disease or your treatment , please read the package supplement ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , A@@ comp@@ lia is used to treat adult patients with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above . &quot;
&quot; in addition , four studies were carried out in more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used as a suppor@@ tive agent to adjust smoking compared to a placebo . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on the placement of the smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia on this application was difficult to estimate . &quot;
&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during the studies ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were Nau@@ sea ( nausea ) and infections of the upper respiratory tract . n@@ g The complete list of adverse events reported in connection with A@@ comp@@ lia is the package supplement . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , since it can increase the risk of depression and can cause su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts in a small minority of patients . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable at the same time use of A@@ comp@@ lia with medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a remedy for using HI@@ V@@ - infection ) , t@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or cl@@ ari@@ o@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight
&quot; treatments applied to patients who need it from health and not cosmetic reasons ( by providing re@@ con@@ na@@ iss@@ ance packages for patients and doctors ) , and around the ar@@ z &quot;
&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which additionally have one or more risk factors like type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years of age due to lack of data on efficacy and harm@@ lessness .
&quot; depres@@ sive diseases or changes in mood with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of the patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used in depres@@ sive disorders , unless the benefit of treatment in individual cases out@@ weighs the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; also in patients who - besides the obesity - do not have any recognizable risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other close persons ) should point out that it is necessary to monitor the re@@ occurrence of such symptoms and immediately seek medical advice if these symptoms occur .
• Ol@@ der patients The efficacy and harm@@ lessness of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently shown .
patients with a cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

&quot; patients with overweight and obes@@ e were examined , and 3@@ 800 patients in other indications . &quot;
the following table ( Table 1 ) shows the un@@ desirable effects of placebo @-@ controlled trials in patients who have been treated for weight reduction and related metabolic diseases .
&quot; if the incidence was statisti@@ cally significant higher than the corresponding placebo rate ( for adverse effects ≥ 1 % ) or if they were clin@@ ically relevant ( for adverse effects , &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 % ) ; often ( ≥ 1 % , &lt; 1 % ) ; rare ( ≥ 0,@@ 01 , &lt; 0.1 % ) ; very t l@@ ä &quot;
only slight symptoms were observed in a comparative study in which a limited number of people were given disposable income of up to 300 mg .
the patients had a BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² or BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² and an existing hyper@@ tension and / or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia .
&quot; weight reduction after one year was 20 mg 6.5 kg for A@@ comp@@ lia , relative to the bas@@ eline value , compared to 1.6 kg for the placebo group ( difference -@@ 4.@@ 9 kg CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.@@ 3 ; -@@ 4,4 , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) . &quot;

&quot; after 2 years , the difference in total weight reduction was between A@@ comp@@ lia and Plac@@ ebo -@@ 4.2 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5.0 % ; -@@ 3,@@ 4 , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
9 Wei@@ ght reduction and other risk factors In studies in patients without diabetes in which a mixed population of patients with

&quot; in a second study in patients with obesity and previously untreated type 2 diabetes ( Ser@@ en@@ ade ) , the absolute change of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value ( with an initial value of 7.@@ 9 % for both groups ) was 0.@@ 8 for Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg and -@@ 0.3 under placebo . &quot;
the percentage of patients who achieved H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c@@ - value of &lt; 7 % was 51 % in the Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant group and 35 % in the placebo group .
&quot; the difference between the average weight change between the 20 M@@ g@@ - and the placebo group was 3.@@ 8 kg ( CI@@ 95 % -@@ 5,@@ 0 , -@@ 2.6 p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
improvement of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value in patients who had taken Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant 20 mg were about 50 % due to direct effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant and explained about 50 % by weight reduction . n ei@@ m Ar@@ z

&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period before the mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects were observed on fertility or cycli@@ cal disturbances . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was examined at the rat in dos@@ ages of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study involving rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and via lac@@ tation did not cause changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot;

&quot; Sum@@ m@@ ary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public Assessment Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) has evaluated the studies carried out in order to make recommendations regarding the use of the medicine . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes drug ) is not displayed .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be satis@@ fac@@ tor@@ ily adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest toler@@ able dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ phon@@ yl resin or insulin , the previous dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the acet@@ yl treatment , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , which makes type 2 diabetes more adjustable . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of Ac@@ tos was studied in tri@@ ple@@ therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ f@@ onic resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos resulted in a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , which indicates that the blood glucose levels were reduced by 15 mg , 30 mg , and 45 mg doses . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ therapy study , the effect of the additional administration of Ac@@ tos for the existing treatment with met@@ form@@ in and a sul@@ phon@@ yl @-@ resin showed a reduction of the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % , while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study where the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients who took Ac@@ tos in addition to insulin showed reduced H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months , compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients who additionally took placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects related to Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ ge@@ th@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or any of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one levels - acid levels in the blood ) . &quot;
it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients with met@@ form@@ in as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in .
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the transportation of Ac@@ tos throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and carry on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination of insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is in@@ appropriate due to contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; for the application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , therefore the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from at least one risk factor ( e.g. previous heart attack or symptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ tery disease ) , the doctor should begin treatment with the lowest available dose and increase the dose gradually . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed with signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed with signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and o@@ ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular outcome study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under the age of 75 with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular vascular disease was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in cardiac in@@ suffici@@ ency reports , which , however , did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output of the liver enzyme ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
&quot; if the AL@@ T mirror is increased to 3 times the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be checked again as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms that indicate a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , over@@ belly pains , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark har@@ n , the liver enzyme values are to be checked . &quot;
the decision whether the treatment of the patient is continued with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one should be directed to clinical assessment before the laboratory parameters are presented .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain has been proven , which can be caused by fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction of mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction of 4 % ) and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under Met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 3.1 @-@ 2 % and hem@@ at@@ ok@@ r@@ its by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients receiving Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral double or triple combination therapy with insulin , the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch , treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ces , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , was reported about a occurrence or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a decrease in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct connection between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the occurrence of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but ad@@ minist@@ ering doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients are informed of visual acuity disorders ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ologic examination should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ised controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medi@@ co .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study over 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; patients should be aware of the possibility of a pregnancy , and if a patient wishes to have a pregnancy or this occurs , the treatment is dis@@ continued ( see section 4.6 ) . &quot;
&quot; studies on the interactions have shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not exercise relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous application of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) resulted in a reduction in AU@@ C from Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 54 % .
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting from pregnancy decreases and increases the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 ; rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &lt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , single cases : unknown ( not estim@@ able from this data ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary modification of the tower and the refrac@@ tive index of the lens as it can also be observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic substances .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege was often referred to as placebo , but less frequently than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
&quot; in an outcome study in patients with advanced advanced mac@@ ular vascular disease , the frequency of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was 1.6 % higher than placebo if pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch , it has rarely been reported about heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials was conducted over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and over 7,@@ 400 patients in the groups treated with comparative medication . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study over a period of 3.5 years , frac@@ tures of 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one were compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days did not appear any symptoms . &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one seems to have an activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( Per@@ ox@@ is@@ ome Pro@@ lifer@@ ator activated Rec@@ ep@@ tor @-@ γ ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat , and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral amount of glucose in the case of insulin resistance .
&quot; a clinical study with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ la@@ cide as mon@@ otherapy was continued for two years , in order to investigate the time until after the therapeutic effect ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) . &quot;
at the time after two years after the onset of therapy a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one at 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide ) .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study over 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was inadequate despite three months of optimization phase with insulin , were random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
in patients with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction of insulin dosage in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed .
in clinical trials over a year under Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on a statisti@@ cally significant decrease of the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ent was shown in comparison to the bas@@ eline values .
the effect of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small examination of type 2 diabetes .
&quot; in most clinical trials , compared to placebo , a reduction of the total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and an increase in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as slight , but clin@@ ically not significantly increased L@@ DL@@ - cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced the overall plas@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de and the free fatty acids and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , there was no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L Cholester@@ insp@@ iegel in Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on , while Met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide were observed . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mac@@ ular vascular disease were random@@ ized in groups who received either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is quickly resor@@ bed , whereby the top concentrations of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in the plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of about three times the efficacy of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative effectiveness of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one has no relevant effect on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ ine , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
simultaneous application of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
after oral application of radio@@ actively marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans the marker was found mainly in decay ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in urine ( 45 % ) .
&quot; the mean plasma removal time of un@@ modified pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours for humans , and all active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
the plasma concentrations of Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy volunteers .
&quot; in toxic@@ ological studies , mice , rats , dogs and monkeys coinci@@ ded with repeated administration plasma volume enlargement with hem@@ odi@@ lution , an@@ emia and rever@@ sible ec@@ centric heart hyper@@ tro@@ phy . &quot;
this is due to the fact that under treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one the hyper@@ insulin resistance resulting in the gest@@ ation is reduced and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal decreases and therefore reduces the availability of the metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder epitheli@@ um were induced .
&quot; in an animal model of the aden@@ omat@@ ous poly@@ posi@@ s ( FA@@ P ) , treatment with two other thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ ces led to increased frequency of colon@@ os@@ tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 30 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
the calculated frac@@ ture incidence was 1.9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women who were treated with a comparative medi@@ co .
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study over 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ zide were examined . &quot;
clinical trials over 1 year showed a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in the Alb@@ um@@ in / Kre@@ at@@ in@@ ine quot@@ i@@ ent in clinical trials over 1 year compared to the bas@@ eline values .
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on the tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic Tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ d synthesis . &quot;
&quot; although the study missed the target with regard to its primary end@@ point , which represented a combination of the total mort@@ ality , non @-@ fatal m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , stroke , acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome , leg amp@@ utation above the an@@ kles , cor@@ on@@ ary re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation and re@@ as@@ cul@@ ar@@ isation of the leg arter@@ ies , the results suggest that the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one does not involve cardiovascular long @-@ term risks . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , flat and carry on one side the marking &quot; 45 &quot; and on the other hand the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of adverse events related to frac@@ tures from random@@ ized , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and more than 7,@@ 400 patients receiving comparative medication , showed an increased incidence of bone frac@@ tures in women . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study over 3.5 years for the examination of cardiovascular events , frac@@ tures occurred at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1,@@ 0 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ; 0.5 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; in a study over 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the N@@ ü@@ chtern tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial increased tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de level , which has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption as well as the h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tra@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , suggest@@ ing that blood glucose levels were similar to that of another human insulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to human insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ ph@@ ane must be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package supplement ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of acet@@ ph@@ ane prevail in the treatment of diabetes over the risks .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice a day , if a fast initial action is desired along with a longer lasting effect . &quot;
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the entire dose is inj@@ ected .
&quot; patients whose blood sugar setting has improved significantly , for example , by an intensified insulin therapy , can change hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change in terms of thickness , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin analog ) and / or production method ( through re@@ combin@@ ant DNA against insulin @-@ animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose adjustment is required when changing to Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the conversion . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic reactions following a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such trips may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; the doctor must therefore consider potential interactions during therapy , and always ask his patients for treatments taken by them . &quot;
&quot; 4 . hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , which can occur in a non @-@ controlled diabetes therapy , increase the risk of ab@@ norm@@ alities and fertility in uter@@ o . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can cause un@@ consciousness and / or sei@@ zur@@ es and end with temporary or permanent brain function disorders and even death .
diseases of the nervous system - peri@@ ph@@ ere neu@@ rop@@ athy A rapid improvement of blood sugar control can be associated with symptoms referred to as acute painful neu@@ rop@@ athy and are usually rever@@ sible .

&quot; a hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can , however , gradually develop : • Easy hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape gather@@ ings , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness is treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of Glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose that is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the total active duration is up to 24 hours . &quot;
resor@@ ption The resor@@ ption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with fast and delayed resor@@ ption .
a number of cle@@ av@@ age ( hydro@@ ly@@ sis ) places on the human insulin molecule were considered ; none of the metabol@@ ites formed by the split are active .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow any particular risks to humans . &quot;

&quot; before each injection , check whether there are at least 12 units of insulin left in the cartridge to ensure an even mixture . &quot;
follow these steps to avoid the injection of air and ensure correct dosage : • Ke@@ ep Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Let with the injection needle up • kno@@ ck a few times with your finger slightly against the cartridge .
&quot; while air bubbles are present , they will accumulate in the cartridge at the top of the cartridge • while holding Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Let continue using the injection needle ( figure C ) • Dur@@ ing the injection needle , press the button inside ( Figure D ) • Now , from the tip of the injection needle , press a drop of insulin . &quot;
&quot; • Set the cap on the production pen again , that the number 0 stands opposite the metering brand ( Figure E ) • Check if the button is fully pressed . &quot;
&quot; if not , turn the cap until the push button is completely pushed down • Ke@@ ep your Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane 10 Nov@@ o@@ Let horizontal . &quot;
&quot; if the push button cannot move freely to the outside , insulin is pressed out of the injection needle • The scale on the closing cap shows 0 , 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 , 12 , 14 , 16 and 18 units . &quot;
&quot; the push button moves outward , while you turn the closing cap • Sc@@ ale under the push button shows 20 , 40 and 60 units . &quot;
&quot; check the number on the cap right next to the dosing marker • add the highest number you can see on the push button • add the two numbers to get the adjusted dose • If you have set a wrong dose , turn the closing cap easily for@@ wards or backwards until you have set the correct number of units . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , insulin is extracted from the injection needle and the inserted dose will not be correct • If you have mistakenly tried to set a dose of more than 78 units , follow the steps below : &quot;
then remove the cap and set it up so that the 0 of the metering brand is over .
&quot; make sure to press the button only during injection . • Ke@@ ep the button pressed completely after the injection , until the injection needle is pulled out of the skin . &quot;
&quot; if not , turn the cap until the button is pressed completely and then proceed as described before using • Pos@@ sible you can hear a cli@@ ck@@ eting noise when pressing the push button . &quot;
it may be in@@ accurate • You can &apos;t set a dose that is higher than the number of units remaining in the cartridge • You can use the residual volume scale to estimate how much insulin is left .

Ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin human ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of acet@@ p@@ id may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the placing of Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of the fast acting insulin must first be raised , followed by the amount of insulin . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose adjustment is required for the change to ac@@ tra@@ p@@ id in the patient , it may be necessary during the first dose or in the first weeks or months after the transition . &quot;
&quot; before travelling , which go over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor since such trips may cause insulin and meals to be used or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; 5 General diseases and complaints at the place of performance - Local hyper@@ sensitivity reaction at the injection site Dur@@ ing insulin therapy , local hyper@@ sensitivity reactions ( redness , swelling , it@@ ching , pain and hem@@ at@@ oma at the injection site ) can occur . &quot;

a clinical study in an intensive care unit for treating hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( blood sugar over 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) with 204 diabe@@ tic and 13@@ 44 non @-@ diabe@@ tic patients who underwent major surgical procedures has shown that an intraven@@ ous Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id induced normal gly@@ ca@@ emia ( blood sugar 4.4 - 6.1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) reduced mortality by 42 % ( 8 % vs 4.6 % ) .
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 1.5 to 3.5 hours and the total active duration amounts to about 7 to 8 hours . &quot;
children and adolescents The pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile of Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id was examined in a smaller number ( n = 18 ) diabe@@ tic children ( aged between 6 and 12 years ) and adol@@ escent ( aged between 13 and 17 years ) .
&quot; the data is limited , but suggests that the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in children and adolescents is similar to that of adults . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already have signs of de@@ formation , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or rheum@@ atic no@@ des ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. larger ur@@ anium deposits which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid levels are still above 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first treatment months , there can still be many cases of g@@ out ; therefore , it is recommended that patients take at least other medicines for the prevention of g@@ out sei@@ zur@@ es during the first six months of treatment with Aden@@ ur@@ ic . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended for children and patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , attended by 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different Aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with the placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
in the second study two doses of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each with allo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol .
&quot; in both studies , al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered at a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients whose urine acid levels in the blood was below 6 mg / dl in the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of the patients who took Aden@@ ur@@ ic in a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 out of 26@@ 9 ) of the patients who took 120 mg once daily , had a ur@@ ic acid level in the blood of below 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of the patients under Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are head@@ aches , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nau@@ sea ) , rash and abnormal liver values . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients suffering from heart problems in pre@@ history , there may also be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid level in the blood than Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side @-@ effects related to the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ anium deposits ( including a medical history known or present in the case of arthritis and / or arthritis ) .
if the serum concentration levels are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks a dose increase can be taken into account at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x a day .
&quot; in patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated until now ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in- Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; children and adolescents Since there is no experience in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences with organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in this patient group is not recommended ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other res@@ inous remedies , it is possible to get an acute plaster attack during the treatment , because by lowering the serum resin , it is initially possible to mobili@@ ze ur@@ ic acid deposits in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; B. in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han @-@ Syn@@ drome ) the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in the urine in rare cases increases so far that it comes to a de@@ position in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during Phase 3 clinical trials , slight ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3.5 % ) . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to carry out a liver function test prior to the start of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ treatment and subsequent clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was did not conduct any interaction studies at F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or may lead to an increase in the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line level ( an inhibit@@ ing of the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line metabolism was also reported to other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; for subjects , the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen 250 mg 2 x was associated with an increase of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ely ( C@@ MA@@ X 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen and other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with a clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
&quot; in a study involving subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily showed a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that simultaneous intake of an an@@ ta@@ cide , containing magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , delayed the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( about 1 hour ) and slow@@ ed down the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data about a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies can not result from side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of fet@@ us / new@@ bor@@ ns .
&quot; animal experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be careful when controlling a vehicle , operating machinery or exercising dangerous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of cardiovascular events reported in the overall f@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ine group was observed in the pi@@ vot@@ al study phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al connection with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors determined in these patients were arter@@ ios@@ clerosis and / or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or de@@ compensated heart failure in the history of the patient .
&quot; frequent ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1,000 ) adverse events related to the medicine could be found in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ ine at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 7 Off@@ ered long @-@ term extension studies Dur@@ ing the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients for up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the reported events reported during long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported more than once in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ e- treatment groups and occurred in patients who received F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term renewal studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patients years ) . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 for these doses or with a lower frequency :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ an@@ aes@@ th@@ esia , show@@ y EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short@@ ness of skin , skin les@@ ion , bur@@ si@@ tis , protein ur@@ ie , ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency in blood , decrease of TS@@ H concentration in blood , decrease of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te count , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
the effective mechanism of ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and arises as part of the Re@@ action as@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → Harn@@ oric acid .
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is an effective non @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) inhibit@@ or with a K@@ i value for in vitro @-@ inhibit@@ ing that lies below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range .
&quot; clinical trial results The effectiveness of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were carried out with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ k@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
&quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients with whom the last three month specific serum concentration levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were present . &quot;
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 9 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum content value at the beginning of study of &gt; 1.5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed a statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority in the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily as well as AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the conven@@ tionally used dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
&quot; patients with serum content &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were summ@@ arized for analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg &quot;
lowering the serum eye level at &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) was observed during the doctor visit in week 2 and maintained continuously throughout the entire treatment .
&quot; 50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum incre@@ mental values &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2,0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily . &quot;
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function restriction The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy of 40 patients with kidney function restriction ( i.e. h .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of the patients . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of serum eye acid concentrations in subjects , regardless of their kidney function ( 58 % in group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in group with severe kidney dysfunction ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub @-@ group of patients with serum resin concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( bas@@ eline ) had a serum @-@ resin @-@ acid concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data collected in the open extension study phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum concentration levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed treatment against a fer@@ til@@ isation ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients did not require treatment against a g@@ out ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the weight of the gi@@ ver , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the g@@ out notes until month 24 . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients who received a long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long @-@ term extension studies ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface below the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at after administration of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dos@@ ed proportional . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase of AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , which is larger than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 and 120 mg 1 x a day , the C@@ MA@@ X is about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5.0 @-@ 5.3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change was observed in the percentage decrease in serum resin concentrations , as long as this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ranges from 29 to 75 l after taking doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
the plasma cutting of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at amounts to about 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly created by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after taking a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at approximately 49 % of the dose was found in the urine as un@@ modified F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , its well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; besides ex@@ cre@@ tion of urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair found itself as imm@@ utable F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , A@@ cy@@ l@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id of the active ingredient ( 1 % ) , whose well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) , as well as other unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; special patient groups ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the middle overall AU@@ C from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ g / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ g / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
12 Li@@ ver dysfunction After taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( Chil@@ d- Pu@@ gh @-@ classification A ) or moderate ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh @-@ classification B ) liver function restriction the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change in comparison to subjects with normal liver function .
age There were no significant changes with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger patients .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , depression of fertility In male rats , a statisti@@ cally significant increase in ur@@ inary bladder tumours ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) was found only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin @-@ stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , with about 11 times the exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical use .
it was found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in high doses , which were around the 4.@@ 3- fold of the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , which accompanied a reduction in the performance and develop@@ mental delays in the descendants of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , approximately the 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which are about 13 times the human@@ istic exposure , yiel@@ ded no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chlor@@ thi@@ azi@@ de / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the other active ingredient used at the same time .
&quot; diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with col@@ ch@@ ic@@ ine at the same time . * * In clinical trials no severe rash or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; 21 Off@@ ered long @-@ term extension studies In the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated for up to 1 year , 3@@ 22 patients for up to 2 years , 57 patients up to 3 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
&quot; in each study , the primary efficacy end@@ point was the proportion of patients with whom the last three month specific serum concentration levels &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) were present . &quot;
&quot; the data collected in the open extension study phase 3 showed that the permanent reduction of serum concentration levels was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients in the months 16 @-@ 24 needed treatment against a fer@@ til@@ isation ( i.e. more than 97 % of the patients did not require treatment against a g@@ out ) . &quot;

&quot; the owner of the marketing authorization has to make sure that a pharmac@@ o@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , is ready before the drug is put into circulation and as long as the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot;
an updated R@@ MP is to be presented in accordance with CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline for risk management systems for human medicines with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • if new information is available , which have an impact on the safety data , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or risk minim@@ isation activities • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance or risk minim@@ isation ) • on request of E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid is in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration down through the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the formation of the crystals is prevented and thus less@@ ening the symptoms . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C should not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the ingredients of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .
&quot; inform your doctor before you start taking this medicine , or if you have a heart defect or have any other heart problem . • If you suffer from a high ur@@ ic acid concentration in a result of a cancer or the les@@ ch @-@ Ny@@ han syndrome ( a rare inn@@ ate disease in which too much ur@@ ic acid is in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; if you have a stroke attack at the moment ( sudden appearance of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , feeling of warmth and joint swelling ) , wait until the worst attack is cleared before you start with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but may also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines to prevent a sei@@ zure or to treat the symptoms associated with it ( such as pain and joint swelling ) . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; it is particularly important that you inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use drugs that may be one of the following substances , as interactions with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may occur and your doctor may possibly have to consider necessary measures . • A@@ ha@@ i@@ op@@ rine ( for the treatment of asthma ) • A@@ ha@@ i@@ op@@ rine ( for treatment of asthma ) • War@@ far@@ in ( for the treatment of asthma ) &quot;
there were no studies on the impact of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C on the per@@ spir@@ ation and the ability to operate machines .
please take AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C only after consultation with your doctor if it is known that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
&quot; the individual week@@ days are printed on the back of the bli@@ ster pack , so you can check whether you have taken one tablet every day . • The tablets must be swal@@ lowed and can be taken with or without food . &quot;
&quot; if you are un@@ inten@@ tional , consult your doctor or emergency room at the nearest hospital . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , take it as soon as possible , unless the next intake is just before . &quot;

&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease in which bones become br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause , in which there is a risk of low vitamin D levels . &quot;
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient must not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; as Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals that are approved in the European Union , the company submitted data from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in terms of increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 @-@ week treatment , the proportion of patients with low levels of vitamin D was lower ( 11 % ) compared to those treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also presented data suggest@@ ing that the Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at dosage contained in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE corresponds exactly to the dose required to prevent bone loss .
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ep@@ sia ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( diar@@ rho@@ ea ) , infl@@ ated abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated stomach ) as well as acid encounter . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE may not be used in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity to al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in diseases of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit upright for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ me Ltd. for the placing of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; cap@@ s@@ ular , white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is to be taken only with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and related side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after getting up the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk of or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . • The patients should not lie before the first intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical interventions in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract ( except for p@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y ) , only be given special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ero@@ sions , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strokes , were reported in patients taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( partially these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore be aware of all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , and patients should be advised to remove the medicine during symptoms of malign@@ ant irrit@@ ation such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain during swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star@@ ry pain or new or worsen@@ ing heart@@ burn , and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be increased in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , after the occurrence of symptoms that point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation , continue . &quot;
it is very important that all dosing instructions are passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate there was no increased risk , rare ( after market launch ) ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , among them some severe and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ ter@@ ry of the jaw , usually related to tooth extraction and / or local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men are predominantly intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available , which indicate whether stopping a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who require a lower surgical procedure , reduces the risk of an o@@ ste@@ on@@ nec@@ ro@@ sis of the jaw . &quot;
clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for therapy planning in each patient based on an individual benefit risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to take a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE the tablet the next morning after having noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but continue taking one tablet per week as originally planned on the day of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting mineral metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should be treated adequately before starting the therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the absorption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate when taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , patients must wait at least 30 minutes after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed medicines , without affecting clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended only for post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and is therefore not to be applied during pregnancy or lac@@ t@@ ating women .
&quot; animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate direct damaging effects in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rop@@ sis of the jaw was reported in patients suffering from bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates ; most of the reports come from cancer patients , but also reported in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , absorption of serum calcium up to &lt; 8,0 mg / dl ( 2.0 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and serum phosph@@ ats up to ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ( 0.@@ 65 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) occurred in both treatment groups with similar incidence . &quot;
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate In@@ fusion of an oral over@@ dose can occur hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia , hyp@@ oph@@ osph@@ at@@ a@@ emia and side effects in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract such as stomach upset , heart@@ burn , es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , ga@@ stri@@ tis or ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were studied in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the frac@@ ture intervention trial ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .
&quot; in the phase III studies , the mean asc@@ ents of BM@@ D with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate amounted to 10 mg / day compared to placebo after 3 years 8.@@ 8 % on the spine , 5.@@ 9 % on the fem@@ ur h@@ al and 7.@@ 8 % on the trough . &quot;
&quot; in the group treated with Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , a reduction of 48 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 3.2 % compared to placebo was 6.2 % ) in the proportion of patients who suffered one or more verteb@@ rate frac@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ters continued ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur @-@ neck and the entire body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; fit consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , in which al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 m@@ g. daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. daily either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least a new ed@@ dy frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % compared to placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .
resor@@ ption to an intraven@@ ous reference dose was the average oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate in women 0.@@ 64 % for doses ranging between 5 and 70 mg after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting and two hours before accepting a standardized breakfast .
bio@@ availability decreased accordingly to about 0.@@ 46 % and 0.@@ 39 % when al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken half an hour prior to a standardized breakfast .
&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if it was taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
in healthy subjects the administration of oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times daily over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) .
&quot; 9 distribution studies in rats have yiel@@ ded that Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate is distributed temporarily in soft tissue after intraven@@ ous administration of 1 mg / kg , but then rapidly spread into the bones or ex@@ cre@@ ted with urine . &quot;

&quot; in the urine of radio@@ actively marked vitamin D@@ 3 in healthy subjects , the mean ex@@ cre@@ tion of radio@@ activity in the urine after 48 hours was 2.4 % , in the waste after 4 days 4.@@ 9 % . &quot;
&quot; characteristics in patients &quot; pre @-@ clinical studies have shown that the proportion of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , which is not deposited in the bone , is quickly ex@@ cre@@ ted from the urine . &quot;
&quot; although no clinical data is available , it is likely that the ren@@ al elimination of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate as in the animal experiments will also be reduced in patients with reduced kidney function . &quot;

Adv@@ agra@@ f is administered to adult patients with a kidney or liver transplan@@ ted to prevent rejection of the transplan@@ ted organ by the immune system .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already used in the EU , the company has presented the results from previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft as well as data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical study were presented to 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients in which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a period of one year ( for example by examining how often a re @-@ transplan@@ tation or resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
&quot; in addition , shorter further studies on 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation have been carried out and investigated , as Adv@@ agra@@ f is recorded in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft from the body . &quot;

&quot; in patients suffering from hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , macro @-@ lid antibiotics ( such as ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin ) or any of the other components , Adv@@ agra@@ f may not be used . &quot;
patients and physicians must be cau@@ tious when other ( especially some herbal ) medicines are taken simultaneously with Adv@@ agra@@ f since the Adv@@ agra@@ f dose or the dose of the same at the same time must be adjusted accordingly .

only doctors who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and the treatment of transplan@@ t patients should arrange this drug or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this may lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or over@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or regime should be performed only under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of a switch to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic pharmaceutical monitoring and appropriate dose adjustments must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains intact . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood levels ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations &quot; )
&quot; after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test mirror should be checked before switching and over two weeks after conversion . &quot;
&quot; on Day 4 , the systemic exposure , measured as a valley mirror , was comparable to both kidney and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated checks of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation under Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure appropriate substance exposure in the immediate post @-@ transplan@@ tation period .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a low clear@@ ance substance , an adjustment of the Adv@@ agra@@ f can may take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the condition of the patient does not allow oral in@@ gest@@ ing of medicines in the first postoperative period , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus treatment may be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; for the suppression of the gra@@ ft rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy cannot be indicated . &quot;
can recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
further dosage adjustments may be necessary later since the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of the patient &apos;s stabili@@ zation after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral Adv@@ agra@@ f therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a once daily dose in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must be converted to a transplan@@ t receiver of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion has to take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , related to the total daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After a switch from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ f once a day the treatment with the recommended oral initial dose for the proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection must begin with the recommended oral initial dose for the treatment of kidney and liver transplan@@ tation .
&quot; heart transplan@@ tation In adult patients , who are switched to Adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Adv@@ agra@@ f in l@@ oral , pancre@@ atic and intest@@ ine transplan@@ ted patients , was performed in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , in an oral initial dose of 0.2 mg / kg / day and with intestinal transplan@@ t recipients in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dosage adjustment in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function To maintain blood fertility in the targeted area can be a reduction of the dose in patients with severe liver function disorders .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the ren@@ al function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that dosage adjustment is not required . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potentials of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , a careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular appointment of serum cholesterol level , a calculation of the cre@@ at@@ in@@ in@@ xing and monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
switching from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When switching from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see Sec@@ tions 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
the dose should primarily be based on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases by means of full blood @-@ tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ level controls .
&quot; it is recommended frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood @-@ level mirrors should also be controlled after switching from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , dose adjustment , changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or at the same time using substances that might alter the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus full blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clear@@ ance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred . &quot;
the data in clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the blood levels in the blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in whole blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ tations are usually in the range from 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and for cardi@@ oid and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were generally used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects which may occur in a sequence of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus under@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; changes of the formulation or regime should be performed only under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in the transplan@@ t ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the retard@@ ant formulation Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
&quot; for proph@@ yla@@ xis of gra@@ ft rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recipients and transplan@@ t recipients in childhood , no clinical data for the retard@@ ant formulation Adv@@ agra@@ ph are available . &quot;
&quot; because of possible interactions that may lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus levels in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies should be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ ph ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , since the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels can be subject to considerable fluctuations under such conditions . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , Pro@@ gra@@ f was known as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy called chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy , which can therefore be found under Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , hyper@@ tension , kidney or liver function disorders , infections , fluid over@@ burden and o@@ ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be restricted due to the possible risk of mal@@ ign skin les@@ ions due to suitable clothing or use of a suns@@ creen with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , changed state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and visual disturbances , a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ agra@@ ph tungsten capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose present , special caution is required for patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary Gal@@ en@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and , consequently , increase or lower the blood values of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is advisable to monitor the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels in the simultaneous administration of substances that can alter the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose to maintain the same concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ics such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Mac@@ ro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) . &quot;
pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the increase in blood levels resulted primarily from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus due to the in@@ hibition of gastro@@ intestinal metabolism .
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus effect on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 Hem@@ mer ; therefore the simultaneous application of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 may affect their metabolism .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can reduce the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tives and thus increase hormon@@ al exposure , precau@@ tionary measures must be particularly cau@@ tious when making decisions on contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal studies have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can potentially reduce the clearance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and pro@@ long their half @-@ life .
&quot; the results of a small number of transplan@@ t patients have no indication that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and outcome of pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; in the case of uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for possible harmful effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and hyper@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns , i.e. : &quot;
the side @-@ effectiveness of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants is often not determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; in the following , the side effects are listed according to their frequency in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1,000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( incidence based on available data ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases such as other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants are commonly increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
&quot; cases of non @-@ virus associated ne@@ ph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy , including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative diseases and skin tumours in combination with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and the high binding of ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma proteins , tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can not be di@@ aly@@ si@@ fiable . &quot;
action mechanism and pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects On the molecular level the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ean protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell nucleus .
&quot; this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um@@ dependent hem@@ ming of signal trans@@ duction path@@ ways in the T cell , preventing tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ tic genes . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , and the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
12 confirmed evacu@@ ation was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks in the Adv@@ agra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 37 ) and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % .
&quot; patients &quot; survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 0,@@ 8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; 25 ( 14 women , 11 males ) and Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) died . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy and safety of Adv@@ agra@@ ph and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared , in combination with my@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o ren@@ al transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; patients &quot; survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 97@@ ,5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) occurred . &quot;

&quot; the incidence of therapy failure after 12 months ( defined as death , transplan@@ t loss , biop@@ sy @-@ confirmed acute rejection or missing follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the treatment difference was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ agra@@ f@@ - C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.@@ 0 % &#93; ) for Adv@@ agra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the Adv@@ agra@@ f arm 3 ( men ) , in Pro@@ gra@@ f arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in arm 6 ( 3 women , 3 men ) died . &quot;
&quot; results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of twice daily @-@ applied pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ tations Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after pancre@@ atic , pul@@ mon@@ ary and intestinal transplan@@ tations . &quot;
&quot; 175 patients transplan@@ ted patients , 4@@ 75 patients undergoing pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation , were used as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant in 6@@ 30 cases . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f was consistent in these published studies in the studies in which pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ center study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported using either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or c@@ ach@@ los@@ por@@ in as part of a 1 : 1 random@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; chronic gra@@ ft rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis is also less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival after one year was 8@@ 0.8 % in the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
in the patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus patients came in 21.@@ 7 % of the cases related to bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % under C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases where C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) , was significantly larger ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were converted from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Thor@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases where no acute gra@@ ft rejection occurred was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) in the patients of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in one study , the incidence of bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi@@ center study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was performed on 205 patients who underwent a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ tation using a random@@ ised tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to reach the desired valley level from 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ tation showed an updated survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; detection methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row enlar@@ gements , additional administration of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 antagon@@ ist D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , which lead to talent between 10 and 15 n@@ g / ml and recently transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
factors such as low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ ite and low protein concentrations leading to an increase in the non @-@ bound group of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or an increase in metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clearance rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
&quot; this indicates that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby the ex@@ cre@@ tion occurs mainly via bile . &quot;
&quot; for stable patients who were converted from Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice a day ) to advance ( once daily ) in ratio 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) relative to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) was approximately 10 % lower than Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended frequent checks of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test levels during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory against other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the retard@@ ant formulation Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;

&quot; adv@@ ates are used to treat and prevent bleeding in patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( caused by the lack of Factor VI@@ II conditional , con@@ genital blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application depend on whether adv@@ ates are used for the treatment of bleeding or for the prevention of bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma but is manufactured using a method called re@@ combin@@ ant DNA :
it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced which em@@ powers them to the formation of the human scent factor VI@@ II .
&quot; adv@@ ate is similar to another in the European Union named Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is otherwise produced so that the medicine does not contain proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies on patients with severe to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A , among them a study of 53 children under six years , the application of the drug was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ates in the prevention of bleeding in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; &quot; was evaluated . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of adv@@ ates ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ates may not be applied to patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human scent factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission approved Ba@@ x@@ ter AG a licence for marketing advoc@@ ates throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage and duration of the sub@@ stitution therapy depend on the severity of the VI@@ II deficiency , according to the location and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity should not fall below the specified plasma levels ( in % of the standard or in I.@@ U. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours in patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
repeat the inj@@ ections every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours in patients under 6 years ) until the risk is over for the patient .
&quot; during the treatment process , the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections are recommended for controlling the dose and frequency of the inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; individual patients can differ in their response to factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and exhibit different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe hem@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ E. of factor VI@@ II per kg of body weight within 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor of VI@@ II plasma activities is not reached , or if the bleeding is not controlled with a proper dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so that other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the rate of administration should be directed after finding the patient , whereby a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies ( inhibit@@ ors ) against factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in the treatment of patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A .
these inhibit@@ ors are always directed against the pro@@ o@@ ag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml Plasma by modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say .
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk of the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in the case of previously treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure @-@ days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors development , a re@@ combin@@ ant VI@@ II @-@ product was observed , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II @-@ product to another , the re@@ occurring of ( low @-@ tri@@ gen ) inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences concerning the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the AD@@ R@@ s in the largest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of which had a higher risk of the formation of inhibit@@ ors , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 000 ) , very rare &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated according to the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected decrease of the blood coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ egels was postoperative ( 10 - 14 postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the period and the factor VI@@ II@@ - Spiegel in the plasma as well as the Clear@@ ance Rate showed sufficient levels again on the 15th postoperative day .
&quot; in clinical trials with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in 145 children and adults 2 with diagnosed heavy to moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) and previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 150 days ) , only one patient showed a low inhibit@@ or ( 2.4 B.@@ E. in the modified Beth@@ es@@ da approach ) after 26 expos@@ ures with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , none of the 53 pedi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed heavy to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) was diagnosed with a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or after previous exposure to factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) . &quot;
in previously untreated patients with an ongoing clinical study 5 of 25 ( 20 % ) treated with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II .
&quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by examining the antibody ti@@ des against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed both a statisti@@ cally significant upward tendency as well as an ongoing peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms occurred which indicated an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity . &quot;
&quot; four patients were isolated on the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , skin rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophil@@ es gran@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;
&quot; 7 As with other intraven@@ ous products , A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E reports hyper@@ sensitivity reactions of the allergic type , including an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic / an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ to@@ id reactions ( frequency unknown ) . &quot;

all pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E were performed on pre @-@ treated patients with severe or moderate hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( base value of the factor VI@@ II activity ≤ 2 % ) .

&quot; based on the data available since the first approval , CH@@ MP has continued to evaluate the benefits @-@ risk assessment as positive , but considered that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s safety profile , which necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , decided that the regi@@ stra@@ r should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited reported to the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the company res@@ ig@@ ns its application for the marketing authorisation of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ women &apos;s cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the chest , the brain , the bones or the soft tissue ( tissues that connect and support other structures in the body ) are affected . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that has been genetically modified so that it can carry a gene into the cells of the body .
&quot; the virus in Adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus , &quot; which has been modified so that it cannot produce copies of itself and thus can cause no infections in humans . &quot;
&quot; adv@@ ancements would have been inj@@ ected directly into the tum@@ ors , enabling cancer cells to re@@ constitute the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is formed of the p@@ 53 gene that is not broken down in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells if the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; at Li @-@ Fem@@ men@@ i cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein does not work properly , and the cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , at the Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer in the area of the under@@ belly , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP reviewed the company &apos;s answers to the questions , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the examination of the initial documents submitted , the CH@@ MP will create a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it has not been sufficiently proven that the injection of adv@@ ex in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tum@@ ors brings benefits to patients . &quot;
&quot; the committee also had concerns about the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the medicine . &quot;
&quot; moreover , the company did not adequately demonstrate that adv@@ ancements can be produced in a reliable manner and that it is not harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP of whether the withdrawal would have consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ passionate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are assembled so that one of the effective components is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by an allergy to pol@@ len @-@ induced inflammation of the nas@@ al passages ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adolescents from 12 years of age , the recommended dose of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and stop as soon as the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ utter@@ ed . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms which were reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during 15 @-@ day treatment .
&quot; during the study , patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed using a standard scale , how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours . &quot;
&quot; when considering all hay fever symptoms except for con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseudo @-@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was seen , the patients showed a relief of 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in patients receiving des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( lack of appetite ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for treating allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( increased intra@@ ocular pressure ) , ur@@ inary retention ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ ose ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ phy ) , hyper@@ thy@@ re@@ ose ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) , or a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without de@@ bit@@ ing , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after listening to the symptoms .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use may decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , the treatment can continue with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n as mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or or within the 2 weeks after termination of such therapy . &quot;
&quot; this is attributable to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined use of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , Lis@@ ur@@ id , cab@@ erg@@ olin , erg@@ ot@@ amine , aph@@ rodisi@@ acs , phen@@ y@@ met@@ az@@ oline , n@@ aph@@ rodisi@@ acs etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient population and the data are not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
the safety and efficacy of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction and the data are insufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or increasing head@@ aches ) must be de@@ posed . &quot;
&quot; treatment of the following patient groups is recommended : • Pati@@ ents with cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck ob@@ struction or bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before performing der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent positive reactions to indicators for skin reactions or reduce them to their extent . &quot;
&quot; as part of clinical trials with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between those treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the placebo @-@ treated patients regardless of whether des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was alone or with alcohol .
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies however did not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities in comparison to the frequency of the normal population .
&quot; since reproductive studies of animals are not always transferred to humans , and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ t@@ oric properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be applied during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it can lead to a di@@ zz@@ iness that may result in impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms can vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , decreased mental al@@ ert@@ ness , cy@@ an@@ osis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and CN@@ S stimulation ( in@@ som@@ nia , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ heads . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , breathing in@@ suffici@@ ency , heart rhythm disorders , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , vom@@ iting , im@@ measurable pain , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , blur@@ red vision and hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; CN@@ S stimulation is particularly likely in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth @-@ dry , pup@@ il @-@ rigid and - di@@ lat@@ ation , skin redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophi@@ lia as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight gli@@ ding , including ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectiv@@ ity drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily did not establish increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ athetic effects , such as increasing blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged between 12 and 78 with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine about the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences in terms of patient sub@@ groups defined by sex , age or eth@@ ni@@ city . &quot;
&quot; as part of a single dose study on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable within 30 minutes after administration in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ ical application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equilibrium of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached day 10 . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ disciplinary study , which was performed as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was found that four subjects des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were badly metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseudo @-@ eph@@ ed@@ rine according to the sole gift of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine bio@@ equivalent was to the exposure of an Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , toxic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can no longer identify any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the effects observed were generally associated with the substance pseudo @-@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
&quot; in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies , the combination of lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n / pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the oral administration of rats in a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day was not ter@@ ato@@ genic . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , the pharmaceutical co@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described is well established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s substance , and its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ chy nose and drow@@ ning or it@@ chy eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose . &quot;
&quot; 20 Under certain circumstances , you may be particularly sensitive to the mu@@ cos@@ a @-@ swelling drug pseudo @-@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , which is contained in this medicine . &quot;
&quot; a malign@@ ant stomach ul@@ cer ( ul@@ cer , which leads to a nar@@ rowing of stomach , small intest@@ ine or es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ) , a bladder neck , bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ ms in the history of the patient ( breathing not due to a cra@@ mp@@ ing of lung mus@@ cul@@ ature ) , a prostate enlargement or problems with the liver , kidneys or bladder . &quot;
&quot; tell your doctor if the following symptoms or diseases occur or be diagnosed with Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : • High blood pressure • Hear@@ ing of the heart , pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ aches or strengthening of existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; if you use Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; when applied in the recommended dosage , it is not necessary to calculate that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze leads to di@@ zz@@ iness or lowers your attention . &quot;
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze If you forgot to take a dose in time , take the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects may be significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .

&quot; after the market launch of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n it was very rare reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breath not , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves and swelling ) or skin rash . &quot;
&quot; cases of pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach pain , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , sleep disorders , muscle pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of eye @-@ catching liver problems has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as a 5 mg tablet , 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0,5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0,5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
&quot; for children between six and eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once daily , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup . &quot;
A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies involving about 4 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four studies of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies in patients who had asthma ) .
&quot; efficacy was measured by modi@@ fying the symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the squares , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance in the day ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to prove that the body uses the sy@@ rup , the solution to take and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is harmless . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , when the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us increased by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in both studies in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % compared to placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the marketing of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; one tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( onset of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be carried out according to the previous illness and can be resum@@ ed after the symptoms have been terminated and resum@@ ed .
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( onset of symptoms on 4 or more days per week and more than 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clinical relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should , however , be informed that in very rare cases it may lead to di@@ zz@@ iness , which may result in impaired mobility or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials in various indications , including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , reported 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us daily , than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common adverse events reported more often than placebo had ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , dry mouth ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
a clinical study involving 5@@ 78 young patients aged 12 to 17 was the most common side effect of head@@ aches associated with 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study , administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) . &quot;
&quot; this includes both the in@@ hibition of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophi@@ lia as well as the in@@ hibition of expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; as part of a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered up to 20 m@@ g. a day over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered in a dose of 45 mg a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight gli@@ ding , including ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectiv@@ ity drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , ap@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may be divided into inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms for less than 4 days a week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the occurrence of symptoms on 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated for further forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , since the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology is similar in the different forms and chronic patients can be easily pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ ited . &quot;
&quot; since hist@@ amine extraction is a caus@@ al factor in all ur@@ tic@@ aria diseases , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is expected to improve the symptoms except for the chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria . this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not react to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines was excluded from the study . &quot;
improved it@@ ching by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and al@@ ert@@ ness significantly as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study comparing patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients reached a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines are not completely ruled out . &quot;
des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n inhi@@ bits in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the medicine C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit and neither a substrate nor an inhibit@@ or of the P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is .
&quot; in a single dose study with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies conducted with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and lau@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in a comparable degree of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n exposure . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety @-@ har@@ mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n can not identify any particular risks to humans . &quot;
&quot; colourful film ( contains lac@@ tose mon@@ ohydr@@ ate , hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , titanium dioxide , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 , Indi@@ go car@@ min ( E 132 ) ) , colour@@ less film ( contains Hy@@ pro@@ m@@ less , Mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ) , car@@ nau@@ ba wax , ble@@ ached wax . &quot;
&quot; eri@@ us can be taken independent of meals , allevi@@ ating symptoms in allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing physician should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years of age are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of an infectious Rh@@ initi@@ s with A@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the diagnosis of an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examinations and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years of age met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experience higher substance strain ( see section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children between 2 and 11 years , which is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sac@@ char@@ ose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ c@@ rose in@@ suffici@@ ency should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies using A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the dimin@@ ishing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group as in the placebo group .
&quot; clinical trials involving adults and adolescents in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , were reported at the recommended dose of 3 % more adverse events in patients with A@@ eri@@ us than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) .
&quot; children between the ages of 1 and 11 , who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy , received a daily supplement of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( between 6 and 11 years ) . &quot;
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of up to 20 mg a day .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study in adults and adolescents , in the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 45 mg a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days in adults , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not establish increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; at a single @-@ daily dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical trials did not cause any impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous intake of alcohol did not result in a strengthening of alcohol @-@ induced performance impair@@ ment nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adult and adol@@ escent patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of Pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi @-@ dose study with the sy@@ rup formulation of children aged between 2 and 11 years with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , which inhi@@ bit limited metabolism . &quot;
the strain ( AU@@ C ) caused by des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6 times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x was about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no clu@@ es for clin@@ ically relevant active substance accumulation after a daily application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 In various single dose studies that AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines cannot be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup is offered in type III bre@@ wing bottles with a child @-@ safe poly@@ propylene cap with 30 , 50 , 60 , 100 , 120 , 150 , 225 and 300 ml . &quot;

&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ le can be removed without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not observed in clinical studies using A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in various indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets a day , compared to patients treated with placebo . &quot;
no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed in a multi @-@ dose study where up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ times clinical dose ) were observed .
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated , and this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was administered over 14 days a day in a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day .
&quot; in a clinical @-@ pharmac@@ ological study , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was applied in a dose of 45 mg a day ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for over ten days , there was no extension of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 m@@ g. daily did not establish increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight gli@@ ding , including ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectiv@@ ity drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and red@@ dening of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as demonstrated by the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; 18 In a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study comparing patients with the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients reached a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets once daily put in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience from clinical studies on efficacy in the application of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents aged 12 to 17 ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before the application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the enam@@ el tablet must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg of melting tablets in the treatment of children under 6 years have not been proven .
the overall frequency of adverse events between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not devi@@ ate significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be the bio@@ equivalent of the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at for the formulation of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses , in which des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was used in a dose of up to 20 mg daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clinical &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flight gli@@ ding , including ampli@@ fication of subj@@ ectiv@@ ity drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this poorly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and under black ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies by A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not studied in pedi@@ atric patients , but in combination with dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;
&quot; food has no significant influence on AU@@ C and C@@ MA@@ x by A@@ eri@@ us A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at , while food T@@ max of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is extended from 2.5 to 4 hours and T@@ max of 3 @-@ O@@ H des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n from 4 to 6 hours . &quot;

&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of processed tablet with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg of ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
the overall analysis of pre @-@ clinical and clinical trial tests for the enam@@ el tablet demonstrated that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical application .
&quot; the safety of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children between 2 and 11 years , which is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed , is identical to that of children who met@@ abo@@ li@@ ze normally . &quot;
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with inherited problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or su@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not be taken . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged between 2 and 11 was similar to the des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n group as in the placebo group .
&quot; infants between 6 and 23 months were the most common adverse events reported more often than in placebo , diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , a single dose of 2.5 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n solution for taking no side effects in patients aged between 6 and 11 years was observed . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see section 5.2 ) were comparable in children &apos;s and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials , the recommended dose of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents did not establish increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also be in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s depending on the duration of the symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the stress caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this restricted met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children aged between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations bigger in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adults , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; since A@@ eri@@ us solution to intake contains the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no Bio@@ equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;
different single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in pedi@@ atric patients were comparable to those of adults who received des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n sy@@ rup in a dose of 5 mg .

A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly persons for the protection against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
&quot; this is a special type of vaccine , which should protect against a strain of the flu virus , which could cause future pan@@ de@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new strain of the flu virus appears , which can easily spread from man to person , because people have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; after the vaccine is passed , the immune system detects the parts of the flu virus contained in the vaccine as &quot; alien , &quot; and antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system will later be able to make antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane covering of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface , which the human body recognizes as a foreign body ) was cleaned , cleaned and used as part of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study sites showed that the study was not carried out in accordance with the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scope of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the guidelines of the E@@ MEA for pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if you are interested in a clinical trial and need more information about your treatment , please contact your doctor . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP &apos;s recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years that are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus ( HIV @-@ 1 ) which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) .
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , A@@ gener@@ ase is available as a solution to take , but it cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r because the safety of this combination has not been studied . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should only be prescribed when the doctor has checked which anti@@ viral drug the patient has taken before , and the likel@@ ihood of the virus to respond to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over 12 years is 600 mg twice a day , which together with twice daily 100 m@@ g. of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and other anti@@ viral medicines are taken . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ gener@@ ase is based on the body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , as@@ gener@@ ase reduces the HIV @-@ quantity in the blood while in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; not cure AIDS , however , may delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies involving 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; the low @-@ dose Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r enhanced drug as@@ gener@@ ase was compared to 20@@ 6 adults who used to take prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ prov@@ able concentrations of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the change in viral load after treatment .
&quot; after 48 weeks , more patients had a viral load of 400 copies / ml than placebo , but A@@ gener@@ ase was less effective than in@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , as@@ gener@@ ase also reduced the viral load , but with the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , only very few responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study with adults who had previously been treated with Prot@@ e@@ as@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , the drug A@@ gener@@ ase strengthened the viral load after 16 @-@ week treatment as effectively as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there was a severe tr@@ ash of the viral load with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r for four weeks compared to the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of as@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( diar@@ rhe@@ a ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ gen@@ ase should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should not be used in patients , the St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or pharmaceuticals that are degra@@ ded in the same way as as@@ gener@@ ase and are inj@@ uri@@ ous in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take aging are the risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of body fat ) , o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue ) or an immune activation syndrome ( symptoms of infection caused by the re@@ juven@@ ating immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of as@@ gener@@ ase in use in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected adults and children over four years out@@ weigh the risks .
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee found that the benefit of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients who had previously not taken a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or has not been proven . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gen@@ ase was originally admitted under &quot; &quot; extraordinary circumstances &quot; , &quot; since only limited information was available at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for the marketing of as@@ gener@@ ase across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gener@@ ase is indicated in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines to treat HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
usually A@@ generic capsules should be administered to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ sters of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) .
the use of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r should take place in consideration of the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre @-@ treatment of the patient ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for taking is 14 % less than of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day together with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ gro@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not investigated in children . &quot;
&quot; a@@ qui@@ ase is not recommended for use in children under 4 years of age , due to lack of data for harm@@ lessness and efficacy ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of A@@ gro@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es should be reduced to 450 mg twice a day in adult patients with severe liver dysfunction on 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous application should be performed in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
A@@ gen@@ ase should not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and also represent substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
vegetable preparations containing St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used due to the reduced plasma concentrations and a dimin@@ ished therapeutic effect of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r while taking am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with ast@@ er@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others by sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; generally , A@@ generators should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver side effects with potentially fatal outcome .
&quot; for the event of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased incidence of liver function disorders under anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored in line with clinical practice .
&quot; simultaneous application of A@@ gro@@ ase and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ one or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , which are mixed via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , is not recommended unless the possible benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects including C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , simultaneous administration of A@@ generic with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of My@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; for patients who use these drugs at the same time , am@@ a@@ qui@@ ase may be less effective because of decreased plasti@@ c@@ isers ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interactions with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives can be altered but the information is insufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is given simultaneously with ammon@@ ia , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ pi@@ ate , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ col content of the A@@ gener@@ ase solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under an age of four years and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be dis@@ continued in duration 5 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , or an ex@@ ac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus . &quot;
&quot; many of the patients had other diseases , to which therapy drugs were required , associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a prolonged anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in the case of hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections leading to severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although multi@@ fac@@ torial ae@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including the use of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose were reported in particular in patients with advanced HIV / or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 sub @-@ medi@@ ums with low therapeutic width should not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic width and represent substrates of the Cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enz@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrates with low therapeutic width ap@@ hor@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r must not be given together with medicines whose active ingredients are predominantly metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are associated with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r causing a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
&quot; in the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma levels by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently unwanted effects on the liver were observed . &quot;
St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can be reduced by simultaneous application of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; when a patient already takes St. John &apos;s wort , the am@@ o@@ dynam@@ ical mirrors are and , if possible , check the viral load and susp@@ end St. John &apos;s Wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required if nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; increased by 50@@ 8 % for C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r were applied twice a day and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day , demonstrating the efficacy and harm@@ lessness of this treatment scheme . &quot;
52 % decreases if Am@@ det@@ ra@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) .
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of ammon@@ ia and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in combination with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but due to the an@@ ta@@ zi@@ dis component of Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in it is recommended that the revenues from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ generators are at least one hour apart ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore the dose of E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) is not necessary dosage adjustment .
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z combined with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is low .
the effect of ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine on other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggest that ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ ine may reduce the serum concentration of ammon@@ ia .
&quot; if these drugs should be used at the same time , caution is advised , because Del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine could be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma levels . &quot;
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult . &quot;
the simultaneous administration of ammon@@ ia and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin led to an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with fab@@ u@@ tin .
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with ast@@ er@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin were not carried out , but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in the plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ τ ) to the 2.@@ 69@@ age compared to the value observed once a day without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can , if applied together with A@@ generic , may lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs when used in combination with as@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase as it can come to resor@@ ption disorders . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous application of anti @-@ conv@@ ul@@ ants , known as enzyme induc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of am@@ ic@@ ell@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase its plasma concentrations and strengthen the associated side @-@ effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the simultaneous administration of as@@ gener@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ids , unless the possible benefits of treatment out@@ weigh the risk of systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oidal effects ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time ad@@ minist@@ ering as@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; since plasma level increases of these H@@ MG Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy including a rh@@ ub@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these medicines with ammon@@ ia is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirrors is recommended , since the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ ine , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased with the simultaneous administration of ammon@@ ia ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , A@@ generators should not be used together with or@@ ally recorded mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) , while at the same time it is advisable to use par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for the simultaneous application of par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors point to a possible increase in the plasma level of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am by 3 to 4 times .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with ammon@@ ia , patients should therefore be monitored for symptoms of op@@ pi@@ ate , especially if low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , no recommendation can currently be given as to how the am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r dose is to be adjusted when Am@@ det@@ ra@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the effect of an additional administration of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives is not predictable , therefore alternative methods of contrac@@ eption are recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended with simultaneous administration of a@@ qui@@ ase ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother as compared to the possible risks for fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study involving pregnant rats , which was administered by injection into the uter@@ us until the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 12 body weight during breast@@ feeding . &quot;
&quot; the further development of descendants , including fertility and reproductive capacity , was not affected by the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r to the dam . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; most of the side @-@ effects associated with A@@ gener@@ ase @-@ treatment were mild to moderate , occurred early and rarely led to the outbreak of treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects listed below are from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , patients received 1200 mg A@@ generic ase twice daily . &quot;
events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as in connection with the study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients as well as in the treatment of occurring laboratory changes ( Grade 3 to 4 ) .
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including loss of peripheral and fet@@ al sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al adi@@ pose tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of breasts and dor@@ so cervi@@ cal fat accumulation . &quot;
&quot; among 113 anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated persons treated with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in combination with Lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / Zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine for a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case was observed ( Sti@@ ern@@ acles ) ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 study , 2@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s showed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ car@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; r@@ ashes were generally mild to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ ul@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and occurred usually during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment had to be canc@@ eled with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV or long @-@ term treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in the case of HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defect , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; with PI pre @-@ treated patients , who received 600 mg A@@ ran@@ ase twice a day together with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) were comparable ; an exception was the increases in tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and CP@@ K levels observed in patients who received as@@ gener@@ ase along with low dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , very frequently . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r bin@@ ds to the active centre of HIV @-@ 1 prot@@ ease , thereby preventing the process of viral g@@ ag@@ - and ga@@ g @-@ pol@@ - poly@@ amide stages with the consequence of an un@@ mature , non @-@ infectious viral particles . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ det@@ ra@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ p Con@@ centr@@ ation ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ det@@ ra@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells .
the connection between the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r versus HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r fired treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral not treated patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day in the ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 study , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred until week 48 , with 14 isol@@ ates gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; a gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isolation of 13 of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , showed resistance patterns similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ E , M@@ 46@@ I , I@@ 5@@ V , I@@ 5@@ V , I@@ 5@@ V , I@@ 5@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 study and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
gen@@ otyp@@ ic detection systems based on gen@@ otyp@@ ical resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of am@@ o@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 54@@ A / L / F / G , I@@ 6@@ 2@@ V , I@@ 54@@ A / M / F / G , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , and L@@ 90@@ M with increased likel@@ ihood of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for analy@@ sing the results of resistance tests . &quot;
phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretations - based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests - can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ic data to estimate the activity of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
companies that drive diagnostic resistance tests have developed clin@@ ically @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test .
&quot; each of these four with a decreased sensitivity to am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r associated genetic patterns creates a certain cross @-@ resistance against rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the sensitivity to in@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data about resistance to cross @-@ resistance between ammon@@ ia and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; based on twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral not pre @-@ treated patients , in which a Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( one of them showed resistance against Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ) , Dar@@ in@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 25 isol@@ ates ) , quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 isol@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ pran@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four out of 24 insul@@ ates ) . &quot;
&quot; contr@@ ari@@ wise , Am@@ det@@ ra@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a massage therapy is recommended in order to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of efficacy of as@@ gener@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice a day is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ized open study with PI pre@@ treated adults after vi@@ ro@@ logical failure ( viral load ≥ 1000 copies / ml ) or standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , predominantly with low @-@ dos@@ ed Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to as@@ gener@@ ase , at least one PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI are included in the study A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis assessed the non @-@ su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison to the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in the viral load ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the viral load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ loss threshold of 0.4 log@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of un@@ born as@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled trials involving a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 with PI were pre@@ treated . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , A@@ generic &apos;s solution for taking and capsules in dos@@ ages of 15 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , 20 mg / kg twice daily and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , with the majority of patients receiving 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
no low dos@@ ed Knight was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ s arranged together with A@@ generic .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of the patients included in the study had a plasma HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml for a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to the bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into consideration when optimi@@ zing the therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the average duration ( t@@ max ) is about 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and approximately 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; increased by 50@@ 8 % , for C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered together with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of ammon@@ ia 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the minimum concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) remained unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ o@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r from the blood stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active ingredient in the plasma , whereby the amount of in@@ bound ammon@@ ia , which represents the active part , remains probably unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ tied ammon@@ ia remains constant , the percentage of free active constitu@@ ents fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the range from C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 need to be administered with caution when given at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the gift of A@@ gro@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times a day , leads to a similar daily ammon@@ ite exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; from the solution , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is less bio@@ available from the solution than from the capsules ; therefore , A@@ gro@@ ase Solution and A@@ gro@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are not inter@@ changeable on a milli@@ gram basis . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , so the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of ammon@@ ia and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low . &quot;
these treatment schemes are comparable to those obtained from healthy volunteers after a dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r twice a day without the simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , malign@@ ant h@@ ep@@ ato@@ bili@@ ary aden@@ omas were observed in dos@@ ages containing the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ bili@@ ous aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic use , yiel@@ ded little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al aber@@ ration contained in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen or gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical everyday life by measuring AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials no significant liver toxic@@ ity was observed in patients , neither during the administration of as@@ gener@@ ase nor after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality , both in the control animals and with the animals treated with ammon@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in case of a systemic plasma exposure which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ju@@ g@@ gling and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ gro@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es are applied without the ampli@@ fying addition of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ sters ) , higher doses of as@@ gener@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for A@@ generic capsules is 20 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , patients with severe liver dysfunction are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be removed 27 , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r causing a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
&quot; increased by 50@@ 8 % for C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r in the plasma , which were achieved in the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg of Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than when am@@ ic@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is administered twice daily . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of ammon@@ ia and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , but a close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed monitoring is recommended , as the effectiveness and harm@@ lessness of this combination is not known . &quot;
treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z combined with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended as the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors is low .
&quot; if these drugs are used together , caution is required ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be carried out , as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on del@@ avi@@ r@@ dine is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin together with as@@ gener@@ ase , a reduction of the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , Fel@@ odi@@ pine , Nic@@ ardi@@ pin , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine and Ver@@ ap@@ am@@ il can be increased . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study where Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µ@@ g Flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times a day ) over 7 days of subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma levels increased significantly , while the endo@@ genous cor@@ ti@@ sol decreased by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; with simultaneous administration of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants along with as@@ gener@@ ase , increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) is recommended because of the possibility of weak@@ ening or strengthening the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
simultaneous administration of or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0.0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg of Nor@@ eth@@ in@@ dr@@ one ) led to a 22 % decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min .
&quot; during pregnancy , this medicine may only be applied after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother in comparison to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study involving pregnant rats , which was administered by injection into the uter@@ us until the end of breast@@ feeding , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in the case of an over@@ dose , the patient must observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) if necessary , to initiate necessary suppor@@ tive measures . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of Am@@ det@@ ra@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied both in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % Hem@@ p concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of Am@@ det@@ ra@@ r is in the range from 0.0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in chron@@ ically infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; contr@@ ari@@ wise , Am@@ det@@ ra@@ r retains its activity against some other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resistance mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into consideration when optimi@@ zing the therapy with PI . &quot;
&quot; while absolute concentration of un@@ tied ammon@@ ia remains constant , the percentage of free active components fluctu@@ ates during dosing intervals depending on the total pharmaceutical concentration in the Ste@@ ady State via the range from C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , drugs that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 need to be administered with caution when given at the same time as as@@ gener@@ ase ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clear@@ ance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction on the elimination of ammon@@ ia and rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is likely to be low . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies of carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r on mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ bili@@ ary aden@@ omas were observed in do@@ si@@ ations using the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8@@ - ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cel@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; however , from the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical studies and therapeutic applications , there was little evidence of the assumption of a clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test of rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations of human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ det@@ ra@@ r was neither mut@@ agen or gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ity studies in young animals treated at an age of 4 days showed a high mortality , both in the control animals and with the animals treated with ammon@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; these results suggest that in young animals the metabol@@ isation routes are not fully developed , so that am@@ o@@ dynam@@ ica or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 infected , prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre @-@ treated adults and children from 4 years onwards . &quot;
the benefit of using a rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; ast@@ er@@ ase solution for inclusion was neither covered with PI pre @-@ treated patients nor with PI pre @-@ treated patients .
the bio@@ availability of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a solution for taking is 14 % less than of Am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r as a capsule ; therefore A@@ generic capsules and solution for taking on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see Section 5.2 ) .
patients should be able to swallow the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution to take in ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for A@@ generic therapy amounts to 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , because there is no dosage recommendation for the simultaneous application of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for taking and low dos@@ ed k@@ rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although dose adap@@ tion for ammon@@ ia is not considered necessary , an application of as@@ gener@@ ase solution for inclusion in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of a toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s solution is contra@@ indicated in infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may lead to a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabol@@ isation of these drugs and possibly cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia ( z ) .
patients should be advised that as@@ gener@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of HIV infection and that they continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the current anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including the treatment with as@@ gener@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of sending HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under surveillance of the International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) , methods are available to determine the drug concentration . &quot;
&quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be removed permanently , if a rash of systemic or allergic symptoms is accompanied or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy has been associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug 49 dependent factors , such as a longer anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and associated metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in the case of hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , there are reports of an increase in bleeding including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ or@@ thro@@ sis . &quot;
it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r causing a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development .
&quot; increased by 50@@ 8 % for C@@ MA@@ X by 30 % , when rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered in combination with am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing with A@@ gener@@ ase can significantly increase its plasma concentrations and lead to side effects associated with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , blur@@ red vision and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 @-@ inhibit@@ ors , Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am has significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the potential risk for humans is unknown . as a result of possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us , there must not be used during pregnancy ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tation rats , am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study involving pregnant rats , which was administered by injection into the uter@@ us until the end of breast@@ feeding , showed a dimin@@ ished increase of 55 body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
A@@ gener@@ ase &apos;s harm@@ lessness was studied in adults and children aged 4 and over in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are in connection with the intake of as@@ gener@@ ase or another at the same time to the HIV treatment , or whether they are a result of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral not previously treated patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r fired treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ ase inhibit@@ ors , the mut@@ ations described are rarely observed . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations that can adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; 62 Based on this data , the benefit of &quot; un@@ bund@@ led &quot; as@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into consideration when optimi@@ zing the therapy with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg ) and can be close to a large pot@@ able volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ o@@ dynam@@ avi@@ r from the blood stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ bili@@ ous aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; in case of a systemic plasma exposure which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than the expected exposure to therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor changes including thym@@ us ju@@ g@@ gling and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed , which indicate a delayed development . &quot;
&quot; if you have further questions , please contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . − This medicine has been prescribed for you personally . &quot;
&quot; it can harm other people even if they have the same ail@@ ments as you . − If any of the listed side effects are significantly affected or you notice any side effects that are not indicated in this use information , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
your doctor will normally instruc@@ t you to apply A@@ gro@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to enhance the effect of as@@ gener@@ ase .
the use of as@@ gener@@ ase is based on the individual viral resistance test carried out by your doctor and your treatment plan .
tell your doctor if you are suffering from any of the above mentioned diseases or taking any of the drugs mentioned above .
&quot; if your doctor recommended that you take A@@ gro@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to ampli@@ fy the effect ( boo@@ ster ) , make sure that you have read the use information on Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r carefully before starting the treatment . &quot;
there is also no sufficient information available to recommend the use of A@@ gro@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r to ampli@@ fy children aged 4 to 12 years or in general in patients under 50 kg of body weight .
&quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; When taking A@@ generic ase with other medicines &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; you may need additional factor VI@@ II to control bleeding . − For patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy , re@@ distribution , accumulation or loss of body fat may occur . &quot;

it is recommended that HIV @-@ positive women should not satisfy their children under no circumstances in order to avoid transmission of HIV .
traffic efficiency and the use of machines There were no studies on the influence of as@@ gener@@ ase on driving ability or the ability to operate machines .
please take this medicine after consultation with your doctor if it is known that you suffer from intoler@@ ance to certain sugar@@ s .
&quot; if you take Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable that you take this more than an hour before or after A@@ gener@@ ase , otherwise the effects of as@@ gener@@ ase can be reduced . &quot;
dose of A@@ gener@@ ase Cap@@ sul@@ es is 600 mg twice a day along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; if your doctor decides that the intake of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not suitable for you , you will have to take higher doses ( 1200 mg ammon@@ ia twice daily ) . &quot;
it is very important that you take the entire daily dose that your doctor has prescribed for you .
&quot; if you have taken a larger amount of as@@ gener@@ ase than you should , if you have taken more than the prescribed dose of A@@ generic , you should contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist immediately . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of A@@ gener@@ ase , take it once you think of it , and then continue taking the ing@@ es@@ tion as before . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of HIV infection , it is not always possible to tell if any side effects caused by as@@ gener@@ ase or other medicines that are taken at the same time or caused by the HIV infection themselves . &quot;
&quot; headache , fatigue , diar@@ rho@@ ea , sickness , vom@@ iting , blo@@ ating skin rash ( redness , bli@@ sters or it@@ ching ) - occasional skin rash may be of serious nature and force you to stop taking this medicine . &quot;

&quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms and in the face , a fat increase on the abdom@@ en and in other internal organs , breast aug@@ mentation and fatty tissue in the neck . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects may be significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; therefore , it is important that you read the section &quot; When taking A@@ generic ase with other medicines &quot; before you start taking A@@ gener@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; in some patients receiving anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment , one can develop a bone disease called o@@ ste@@ on@@ ec@@ rose ( death of bone tissue due to insufficient blood supply of the bone ) . &quot;
&quot; if you take Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , it is advisable that you take this more than an hour before or after A@@ gener@@ ase , otherwise the effects of as@@ gener@@ ase can be reduced . &quot;

&quot; the treatment frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the condition to be treated : • For small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream must be applied five times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered to apply to the affected skin areas so that it leaves sufficiently long ( approximately eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared with a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies involving 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the treated war@@ ts . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated six weeks or five times a week . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the number of patients with complete healing of the tum@@ ors after twelve weeks . • Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies involving 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; • In all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total healing rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in patients treated with placebo . • The results of the two studies on bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas showed a complete treatment rate of 66 % to 80 % compared to 0 % to 3 % in the placebo group . &quot;
the most common side effects of al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or the number of les@@ ions limit the effectiveness and / or the acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; apply on Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is continued until all visible patches of the genital or the peri@@ l range have disappeared , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intense local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period , the les@@ ions are completely healed after the second treatment period , another therapy should be started ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and then proceed with the usual therapeutic plan . &quot;
&quot; i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is spread in a thin layer and rub@@ bed into the cleaned , infected skin area until the cream is fully trac@@ ted . &quot;
it should take a balance between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease .
it should take a balance between the benefit of a treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft vs. host reaction .
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pro@@ gen@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis were observed and one case with a stri@@ k@@ tur to circumc@@ ision was observed . &quot;
&quot; when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ation ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases , severe local skin irrit@@ ations were observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or caused a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine , which necess@@ itated emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous inj@@ ected means for the treatment of external sei@@ zur@@ es in the genital and peri@@ l range , no clinical experience has yet to be found . &quot;
&quot; limited data may indicate an increased rate of exposure reduction in HIV @-@ positive patients , but I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream has shown reduced efficacy in this patient population . &quot;
&quot; the treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , the nose , the lips , or the hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions are frequent , but the intensity of these reactions decreases in general during therapy or the reactions are after completion of the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s complaints or due to the severity of local skin reactions , a treatment period may be made of several days . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy can be assessed after regeneration of the treated skin about 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; since there are currently no data on long @-@ term cure rates of more than 36 months after the treatment , other suitable forms of therapy should be considered in super@@ fici@@ inal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre @-@ treated BC@@ Cs no clinical experience is present , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tumours . &quot;
data from an open clinical study point out that in large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) there is a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of acute ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or in the ears or on the lip area within the lips . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside of the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis on the for@@ ear@@ ms and hands does not support the effectiveness of this use purpose , therefore such application is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; local skin reactions frequently occur , but these reactions normally decrease in intensity over the course of the therapy or go back after the treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream . &quot;
&quot; if the local skin reactions cause a large discomfort or are very strong , the treatment may be exposed for a few days . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial showed that patients with more than 8 patients showed a lower overall healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
&quot; due to the immun@@ os@@ tim@@ ul@@ atory properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be applied with caution in patients receiving an immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies show no direct or indirect harmful effects on the pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
although neither after a one @-@ time nor after several topical application quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) have been achieved cannot be recommended for use during breast@@ feeding .
the most commonly shared and prob@@ able or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in related side effects in the studies with three times weekly treatment were local reactions on the site of treatment of cow@@ ards ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
among the most commonly reported and as likely or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include complaints at the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream were reported below in a placebo @-@ controlled Phase III clinical trial .
&quot; the most common , most likely , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to adverse side effects were in these studies a reaction to the application site ( 22 % of patients treated with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
adverse events indicated by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical studies with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ treated patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose are listed below .
&quot; according to the test schedule , the clinical signs were assessed that these placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently led to local skin reactions including ery@@ thema ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ c@@ ori@@ ation / ab@@ stain@@ ing ( 23 % ) and ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the test plan , the clinical signs were assessed according to the test schedule , showing that in these studies five times weekly treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream was very common to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and to severe color@@ atur@@ ation and swelling ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials investigating the use of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or around the surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the accidental one @-@ time oral absorption of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically most serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ ony , which norm@@ alized after oral or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , systemic concentrations of alpha @-@ interfer@@ on and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al phase 3 efficacy studies could be shown that the efficacy in relation to a full healing of the cow@@ ards in an I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of a placebo treatment is significantly superior .
&quot; in 60 % of the patients who were treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , all patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od healed completely ; this was the case with 20 % of the patients with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; full healing could be achieved in 23 % of 157 patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , compared to 5 % of 161 with placebo @-@ treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in five @-@ year use per week over 6 weeks was studied in two double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials .
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fi@@ denti@@ al bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that about 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; were clin@@ ically cured and that remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week , treatment @-@ free period , was studied in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
&quot; patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , not hyper@@ trop@@ hic acts within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on un@@ ha@@ iry scal@@ p or face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined observation studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications of outward F@@ eig@@ ni@@ ces , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ ato@@ sis and bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma usually do not occur in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dar@@ a cream was studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled trials in children aged 2 to 15 years with m@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not shown in these studies in the dos@@ ages studied there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks respectively ) .
a minimal systemic insertion of the 5 % i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream by the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose was observed during the three times weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest drug concentrations in serum at the end of week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and amounted to 0,1 , 0,2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bags ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
&quot; the estimated half @-@ life time was approximately 10@@ times higher than the two @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous application in an earlier study , pointing to an extended retention of the drug in the skin . &quot;
the data on the systemic exposure showed that the resor@@ ption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ ill skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity in rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg kg resulted in significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for the der@@ mal application for four months showed no similar effects in the mouse . &quot;
a two @-@ year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days a week did not indu@@ ce tum@@ ors at the application .
&quot; the corresponding mechanism is not known , but since I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od possesses only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ agen , there is a risk for the human being to look very low due to the systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; the tum@@ ors occurred in the group of mice treated with the active @-@ free cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

&quot; if it remains untreated , it can cause de@@ formations , especially in the face - so early detection and treatment are important . &quot;
&quot; ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses are rough areas of the skin , which occur in people exposed to exposure to sunlight during their previous lives . &quot;
Al@@ dar@@ a should be applied only in flat ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in the face and on the scal@@ p in patients with a healthy immune system where your doctor has decided that Al@@ dar@@ a is the most suitable treatment for you .
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Cream supports your body &apos;s immune system in the production of natural substances that help your body to fight the superficial bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma , the ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or the virus responsible for infection with cow@@ ards . &quot;

a degra@@ ded number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to create a blue stain in a faster way or can cause de@@ fl@@ ation .
tell your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects may be significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; in addition , you may feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you applied Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; mostly these are lighter skin reactions , which end up again within about 2 weeks after the treatment has been removed . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes in the application site ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , skin irrit@@ ation , bli@@ sters , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;

Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with confirmed diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerve ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; the following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints that complic@@ ate movements , reduced lung volume , heart and eye diseases . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ alization devices , and patients may need appropriate medicines prior to administration to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study mainly investig@@ ates the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness was measured ( by examining its effect in relation to the reduction of G@@ AG concentrations in the urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under the age of five , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in over 1 out of 10 patients ) include headache , nausea , abdominal pain , skin rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in the limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat @-@ feeling , fever and reactions to the in@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients under five years are increased blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a meas@@ ur@@ ability of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ lac@@ tic reaction ) .
&quot; each year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all the new information that may be known and where necessary update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in terms of reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission granted Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. a licence for the marketing of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , ov@@ ary of the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme therapy in patients with the diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) in order to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be performed by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other inherited metabolic diseases .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosing regi@@ men can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effects that occur during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially those patients should continue to be closely monitored , and the in@@ fusion of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; due to the clinical phase 3 study , it is expected that almost all patients of Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase usually form within 3 months from the start of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions have to be treated with caution when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; there is little experience with regard to resum@@ ption of treatment after a longer break , due to the theoretically increased risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reaction after an inter@@ ruption of treatment must be cau@@ ti@@ ously anticipated . &quot;
&quot; 60 minutes prior to the onset of in@@ fusion with medicines ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ rites ) , to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions . &quot;
&quot; in case of light or moderate in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction , the in@@ fusion must be stopped until the symptoms have been reduced , a treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of the in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the preceding reaction occurred .
&quot; Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be applied at the same time with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the intra@@ cellular intake of Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect detri@@ mental effects on the pregnancy , which include embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no new@@ born data exposed to breast milk over breast milk , it is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which were observed in 53 % of the patients in the phase 3 study ( duration of treatment up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) .
adverse drug reactions related to al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the phase 3 study and their pro@@ long@@ ation in a total of 45 patients aged 5 years or older at a treatment duration of up to 4 years are listed in the following table according to the following frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ ness and facial oils ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ desirable drug interactions in connection with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 years , with predominantly severe sequ@@ ential form and a treatment duration of up to 12 months , are listed in the table . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients there was a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version within 3 months after the start of the treatment , whereby the patient aged less than 5 years showed a ser@@ o@@ kon@@ version within one month ( average after 26 days versus 45 days in patients aged 5 years and older ) . &quot;
&quot; up to the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until premature departure from the study ) , no antibodies were detected in 13 / 45 patients ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients in whom it never came to ser@@ o@@ con@@ version . &quot;
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction of G@@ AG &apos;s mirror in urine whereas in patients with high antibody ti@@ tr@@ es a variable reduction of G@@ AG in urine was determined .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase Activity in Vit@@ ae which did not seem to interfere with the clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear in connection with the incidence of un@@ desirable drug reactions , although the occurrence of un@@ desirable drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the reasoning for the enzyme replacement therapy is in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub@@ str@@ atum and the prevention of another accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzyme activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were studied in a random@@ ized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire spectrum of diseases , the majority of patients were of the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of expected value and they had to be able to stand for 6 minutes and go 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the absolute distance in the 6 @-@ minute walk test .
all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) .
after 26 weeks of therapy the patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement of the lung function and the ability to be cured in the following table .
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as from the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased propor@@ tionally to the height of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a h@@ ep@@ atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) up to the end of the study had a normal liver size . &quot;
&quot; within the first 4 weeks , a significant drop in the G@@ AG @-@ mirror was found in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in ) , which remained constant until the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation between the patients , which was taken into account by using a combined end@@ point ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in 6 @-@ minutes hearing test , range of movement of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 26 patients ( 58 % ) , no change in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a worsen@@ ing in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was carried out in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients at the time of their inclusion in the study under 5 years old ( 16 patients with the severe die @-@ loop form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased due to increased g@@ ag@@ - levels in the urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks to 200 E / kg .
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group . younger patients with the severe delay form ( &lt; 2.5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development speed , whereas in the older patients with severe delay , there were only limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , investigations into pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosing regi@@ mens on the G@@ AG mirrors in urine , liver volume and 6 @-@ minute hearing test were performed . &quot;
&quot; intraven@@ ously once weekly ( recommended dose ) , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
the dosage intake of 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent an acceptable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical effectiveness of these two dosage schemes is equivalent .
&quot; the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review any new information available annually , and if necessary , the summary of the characteristics of the medicine will be updated . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic profile in patients aged less than 5 years was similar to those in older and less strongly affected patients .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety mac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity with a unique gift , toxic@@ ity with repeated administration and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not allow any particular risks to humans . &quot;

this register is subject to long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment .
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase which spl@@ its certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small quantity before or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to any of the components of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me or if you have encountered a severe allergic reaction to larv@@ on@@ id@@ ase .
an in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines , please inform your doctor if you are taking drugs that contain chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ ine or proc@@ ain because a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me exists . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription drugs . &quot;
instructions for handling - di@@ lution and application The concentrate for producing an in@@ fusion solution must be dil@@ uted prior to application and is intended for intraven@@ ous use ( see information for doctors and medical professionals ) .
&quot; the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can , if the patient toler@@ ates this , can gradually be increased to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h every 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I@@ - conditional involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in pre@@ history , however , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , breathing still@@ ness and facial oils . &quot;
&quot; very common ( occurrence with more than 1 out of 10 patients ) : • headache • nausea • abdominal pain • Skin pain , joint pain , back pain , pain in arms and legs • Sle@@ eps • F@@ ills • lower pulse • hyper@@ tension • less oxygen in the blood • reaction to the in@@ fusion zone &quot;

preparation of the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in@@ fusion ( using as@@ ep@@ tic technique ) • Dep@@ ending on the body weight of the individual patient first determine the number of di@@ lution fl@@ ushing bottles .
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant - cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used in patients who have not yet been treated , combined with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies than any therapy . &quot;
&quot; to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , before or after the gift of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , a &quot; anti @-@ eme@@ tics &quot; ( medicine against vom@@ iting ) and liquids ( to prevent a lack of fluids ) should be given . &quot;
&quot; patients whose blood image changes or in which certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be postpon@@ ed , removed or the dose is reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
&quot; the conversion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active life in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a main study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy against their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta was also compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another drug against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in a study of 1 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients who were treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months at the sole administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
&quot; patients who had previously received chemotherapy had an average survival time of 8.3 months , compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , however , patients with whom cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous epitheli@@ al cells showed longer survival times as compared with the comparative medicine . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. for the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; each bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) , resulting in a resolution of 25 mg / ml . &quot;
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the pier@@ cing flas@@ k and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is indicated in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell @-@ cell lung cancer except for the predomin@@ ant plate @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ - and advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma ( see Section 5.1 ) .
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes each 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours about 30 minutes after completion of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day of each 21 @-@ day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell lung cancer following previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered as intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes each 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid will be given the day before and on the day after treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must continue throughout the treatment duration and for another 21 days after the last dose of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients must also receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed dose as well as after each third treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood sample should be created before each dose , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose check must take place taking account of the N@@ adi@@ rs of the blood image or the maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of previous treatment cycles . &quot;
&quot; after recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 that apply to A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria correspond to the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC Grade 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ degree 3 ( excluding neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before treatment &quot;
treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ ti@@ o- ne hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity level 3 or 4 occurs or so@@ - onwards in the occurrence of degrees 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
clinical studies showed no indication that in patients aged 65 years or more compared to patients at the age of 65 there is an increased side effect risk .
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age due to insufficient data on harm@@ lessness and effectiveness .
&quot; in clinical trials , dose adjustments of ≥ 45 ml / min were not necessary for patients with dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see Section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in case of liver metast@@ ases ) or &gt; 5,@@ 0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not specifically studied in the studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with regard to bone mar@@ ital immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ phy number has once again reached a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number has reached a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count and maximum non @-@ hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in the previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction in Grade 3 / 4 ha@@ em@@ at@@ ologic and toxic@@ ity toxic@@ ity such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre@@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 had taken place . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all patients treated with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be instructed to apply fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure for reduction of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous in@@ gest@@ ing of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients for therapy with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ life time for at least 5 days prior to the therapy , on the day of the therapy and at least 2 days after the therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients experiencing these events had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre@@ valent high blood pressure or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in patients with a clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in trans@@ cellular space , drainage of the eff@@ usion to the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment should be considered . &quot;
&quot; 5 serious cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were occasionally reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed when this substance is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous application of atten@@ u@@ ated life vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , men should be advised to seek advice regarding sperm preservation . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) , high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g per day ) can lead to reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re @-@ elimination with the result of an increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
&quot; therefore , caution is recommended if patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) can be used high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses . &quot;
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high dosage for at least 2 days before the therapy , in the day of therapy and min@@ des@@ - tens 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data is available with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with a long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ - x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous application with P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed should be avoided for at least 5 days before the therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ - xed . &quot;
the great in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of coag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed in pregnant women , but as for an@@ de@@ - or an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites , serious birth defects are expected during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed may not be used during pregnancy , except if necessary - and after careful weighing of the benefits for the mother and the risk for the fet@@ us ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to the reproductive capacity by P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised before the course of treatment to obtain advice regarding the sperm preservation order . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is transferred to breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be excluded .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and were random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed and 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
&quot; side effects : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 000 and &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) and not known ( based on the available data of spontan@@ eity ) . &quot;

&quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of patients who received random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , included ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and mot@@ oric neu@@ rop@@ athy . &quot;

&quot; the clin@@ ically relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity grade 3 and 4 was similar in phase 2 combined with the summ@@ arized results of three P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed @-@ Mon@@ other@@ api@@ studies , excluding neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to be attributed to differences in the patient population as the pha@@ - se 2 studies both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests included .
&quot; the following table shows the frequency and severity of unwanted effects that could possibly be related to study medication ; they were reported at &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC , who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine in 8@@ 30 patients . &quot;

&quot; severe cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular insulin and trans@@ itory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks have been reported in hospital studies with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed , which is usually administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; clinical studies have occasionally reported cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal per@@ fo@@ - ration , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and ty@@ ph@@ litis ) . &quot;
&quot; from clinical studies , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were sometimes reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed treatment . &quot;
it has been reported in cases of acute ren@@ al failure at p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were ir@@ radi@@ ated before , during or after their p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see Section 4.4 ) . &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed ) is an ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate that ex@@ erts its effect by interrup@@ ting important acid @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication .
&quot; in vitro studies showed that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as an anti@@ qu@@ ate with several targets by blocking the thy@@ mi@@ dy@@ lat@@ ti@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ e- m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the fol@@ ate @-@ dependent key enzymes of the de nov@@ o bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi@@ center , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin against c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ ial cells showed that patients treated with C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin were treated with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for a medi@@ an 2.8 @-@ month period . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients who received investig@@ ational medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
a statisti@@ cally significant improvement of clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ ial arm was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) compared to the u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous C@@ is@@ pla@@ ine arm ( 2@@ 18 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement of the lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and the in@@ timi@@ dation of the lung function over time in the control arm .
&quot; a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC showed medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on the overall survival fell in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 6.2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1,@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
limited data of a separately random@@ ized controlled Phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre @-@ treatment by doc@@ et@@ axel are similar .
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination compared to gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
&quot; mean P@@ FS was 4.@@ 8 months for the combination A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 27.@@ 3 - 3@@ 3,@@ 9 ) for the combination of gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;

&quot; patients receiving A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 1 % versus 27.@@ 3 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) and thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the patients required the administration of ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ opo@@ ie@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 6.1 % , p = 0.00@@ 4 ) , and iron preparations ( 4.3 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mit as a mon@@ otherap@@ ist were examined in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with various solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in urine and 70 % to 90 % of the administered dose will be found in urine within 24 hours after the application .

&quot; in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le @-@ dogs , who had received intraven@@ ous Bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , Tes@@ tic@@ ular changes were observed ( degeneration of the corneal epitheli@@ al tissue ) . &quot;
&quot; unless otherwise applied , the storage times and conditions after preparation are in the responsibility of the user and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has taken place under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
&quot; dissolve the contents of the 100 mg capsule with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preser@@ vatives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed . &quot;

it is used in obes@@ e adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of ≥ 28 kg per square meter in combination with low @-@ cal@@ orie diets .
patients who take allergy and do not have weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are ham@@ mer@@ ed , they can &apos;t break down some fats in the food , which causes about a quarter of the fats fed to the food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
in a third study All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo .
&quot; in both studies in patients with BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who took All@@ i 60 mg recorded an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after one year , compared to 2.3 kg when taking placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily patches on the anus , fl@@ atus ( win@@ ch ) with stu@@ h@@ work , bow@@ string , o@@ ily / o@@ ily chair , leaving o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( win@@ ch ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients treated with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in to prevent blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; furthermore , it must not be applied in patients suffering from long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( not sufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) , and for pregnant women or breast@@ feeding mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited for placing Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K in the European Union . &quot;
all@@ i is indicated for weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass @-@ Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be applied in combination with a slightly hypo@@ cr@@ oric acid @-@ induced diet .
&quot; all@@ i must not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , as there is not enough data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , since or@@ list@@ at is resor@@ bed only to minimal resor@@ ption , no adjustment of the dosage is necessary for elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function . &quot;
• hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or any of the other ingredients • Simul@@ tane@@ ous treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • St@@ opping time ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see sections 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the probability of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken together with a fat @-@ rich meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i , because the dosage of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic should be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dose of this drug needs to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional fluctu@@ ating measures in order to prevent possible failure of the oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on the interactions of pharmaceuticals and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a lowering of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma is observed .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( internationally normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; most patients who were treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years remained the concentrations of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a supple@@ mental mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin preparation before bed@@ time to ensure sufficient vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the dose of a one @-@ time dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a limited number of healthy volunteers , who received or@@ list@@ at at the same time , observed a minor decrease in the am@@ o@@ dar@@ one plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect negative effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are related to the pharmac@@ ological effect of the medicine , since the absorption of absorbed fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were determined from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and transi@@ ent .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 000 ) and very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of adverse events reported after the or@@ list@@ at market launch is unknown , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible and actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg of or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e subjects over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after the market launch of or@@ list@@ at over@@ dose , no side effects or similar side effects , as reported at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at , were reported . &quot;
&quot; based on studies on humans and animals , a rapid reg@@ ression of any systemic effects caused by or@@ list@@ at characteristics can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect uses co@@ valent bonding to the active ser@@ ine rest of the ga@@ stri@@ c and p@@ ank@@ re@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine .
&quot; clinical studies have been derived that 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , blocks absorption of about 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double @-@ blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled trials in adults with BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 substanti@@ ate the efficacy of 60 mg of or@@ list@@ at , which was taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ cr@@ oric , fat @-@ du@@ ed diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in body weight compared to the bas@@ eline value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , has been evaluated as follows : as a change in body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a proportion of those participating in study ( table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although the weight reduction in both studies has been observed over 12 months , the biggest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( bas@@ eline value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was 60 mg -@@ 3.5 % ( bas@@ eline : 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( bas@@ eline : 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .

&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which you also find as an indication of the packaging of foods . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should take maximum per day . &quot;
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; what quantity is suitable for you , refer to the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is suitable for you . • Due to the capsule &apos;s mode of action , adher@@ ence to recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot process this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by adher@@ ence to recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss while reducing the probability of hazard @-@ related complications . • You should try to increase gradually and continuously . &quot;
this decreased cal@@ orie intake should allow you to lose weight incre@@ mentally and continuously about 0.5 kg per week without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments .
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; S@@ low physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal per day , work in the garden or do other physical activities . &quot;
• For a lasting weight loss it is necessary to set realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and to adhere to them . • Sen@@ se is a nutritional journal with information on the cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i .
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a food plan and a large number of additional information materials that can help you to nour@@ ish cal@@ orie and fatty acids and give guidelines to become physically active .

&quot; Alo@@ is is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as for chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the effectiveness of al@@ op@@ xi can be increased by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine that can be used as an anti@@ em@@ etic ) .
&quot; it is not recommended for patients under 18 years of age , as there is not enough information for the effects of this age group . &quot;
&quot; this means that the active substance prevents binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in three main studies , Alo@@ is was studied at 1 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong and moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , showed 59 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi , in the 24 hours following chemotherapy , no vom@@ iting ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate trigger for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) , compared to 69 % of patients treated with on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 from 185 ) . &quot;
in comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 out of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a license to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ is is inde@@ xed : for prevention of acute nausea and vom@@ iting in heavily em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , due to a cancer illness and for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer . &quot;
&quot; the efficacy of al@@ op@@ xi for the prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given prior to chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon , patients with am@@ nesty enti@@ t@@ lements or signs of a sub@@ acute I@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised with simultaneous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that pro@@ long the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is prolonged or which tend to an extension . &quot;
&quot; apart from a further chemotherapy regi@@ men , in the days following chemotherapy , Alo@@ is should not be used to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not inhi@@ bit the activity of the five investigated chem@@ otherap@@ ists ( c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , cy@@ tar@@ ab@@ ine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; a clinical study showed no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady @-@ stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ lo@@ pra@@ mi@@ ds , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis showed that simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ o@@ dar@@ one , c@@ im@@ e@@ ti@@ dine , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in , flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , nit@@ rit@@ ine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , Ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ ine ) had no significant effect on the Clear@@ ance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; experiences for the use of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies are not present , therefore Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most common side effects observed at a dose of 250 micro@@ grams ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , at least possibly with al@@ op@@ xi in connection with head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions to the performance ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) have been reported in post @-@ marketing reports . &quot;
&quot; in the group with the highest dosage , similar frequency of adverse events occurred as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships to be observed . &quot;
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , but due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably no effective therapy for al@@ op@@ oxi@@ - over@@ dosage . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double @-@ blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and 250 mc@@ g Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( half @-@ life time of 7.@@ 3 hours ) were obtained , which was given intraven@@ ously on day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ised double blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 Cy@@ clo@@ phosph@@ amide and D@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of p@@ alli@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared to patients who received 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron which were given intraven@@ ously on day 1 . &quot;
results of early chemotherapy studies and the study of highly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials for the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of p@@ alli@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron on blood pressure , heart rate , and EC@@ G parameters , including the Q@@ t@@ c interval , were comparable with the corresponding effects of on@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; according to clinical studies , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron possesses the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ arization and pro@@ long the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the study carried out at 2@@ 21 healthy volunteers was the assessment of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of intraven@@ ous pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration a gradual elimination of plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination of the body with an average term half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours .
the average maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the surface below the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ 3- 90 μ g / kg in healthy and cancer patients .
after intraven@@ ous administration of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses the mean ( ± SD ) increase in the Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron plasma concentrations measured in 11 testi@@ cular cancer patients was 42 ± 34 % .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations illustrate that the total tex@@ tual position ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) achieved with an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg was comparable ; however , the C@@ MA@@ X was higher after the one @-@ off dose of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
&quot; about 40 % are eliminated through the kidneys and around 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites , which in comparison to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vitro studies on metabol@@ isation have shown that C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , to a lesser extent , are involved in the I@@ so@@ enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 on the Met@@ abol@@ ism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in urine , pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as imm@@ utable agent made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous injection of bol@@ us in healthy eyes , the total body composition 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver dysfunction have increased the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure to pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction of the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , effects were observed only after ex@@ positions , which are considered sufficient for the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
&quot; 10 out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies , evidence suggests that pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations , which are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and pro@@ long the action potential . &quot;
&quot; high doses of pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose met in about the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure to humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased incidence of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid , p@@ itu@@ itary , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mark ) and skin tum@@ ors in rats , but not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since al@@ op@@ xi is determined by humans for a unique application , the relevance of these results is considered to be low for humans . &quot;

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative report in which the licensing of the approval for the placing of the medicine prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same dentist , which is already approved in the EU ( also known as &quot; reference drug &quot; ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ oni@@ um should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( prolonged ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by viral infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ scopic examination the liver tissue has damages , and the values of the liver enzyme al@@ anine amin@@ ot@@ ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) in the blood are also increased . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( active ingredient structure , composition and purity of the medicine , effectiveness , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study on patients with hepatitis C , the efficacy of Al@@ ph@@ aco was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor in 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study measured how many patients after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after setting up the treatment responded to the medicine ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .

&quot; in addition , concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Al@@ ph@@ el@@ on and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
&quot; after the treatment with Al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease worsen@@ ed again with more patients than with the reference drug agent ; in addition , Al@@ ph@@ el@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to examine the question to what extent the drug triggers an immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug ) is not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used for the treatment of im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cut wounds ) , abra@@ sions and se@@ wn wounds . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used for the treatment of infections that have been proven to be demon@@ stra@@ ble or probably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ ic Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) , because Alar@@ go may not have an effect against this type of infection . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ tar@@ go can be applied to patients from the age of nine months , but in patients under 18 years of age , the skin surface to be treated must not exceed 2 % of the body surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced ) and thus inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was acc@@ ru@@ ed at the end of the treatment .
&quot; 119 ( 8@@ 5,@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo referred to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were taken together at Hau@@ tw@@ onds , about 90 % of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( ice @-@ filled cavi@@ ties in the body ) or from infections which were demon@@ stra@@ bly or presumably caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with Al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the site .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go in short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections out@@ weigh the risks : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ ations , abra@@ sions or stit@@ ched wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . approval for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go throughout the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy can be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in case of sensi@@ tization or severe local irrit@@ ation by applying re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully wi@@ ped and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started . &quot;
&quot; retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is not intended to treat infections , where MR@@ SA is known as a patho@@ gen or is suspected ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) was insufficient .
an alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected body occurs after a 2- or 3 @-@ day treatment .
the effect of the simultaneous application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended .
&quot; due to the low plasma concentrations , which were achieved in humans after topical application on sk@@ ewed skin or infected superficial wounds , clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times a day , 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole increased the mean ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x after topical application of 1 % re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment on sk@@ ewed skin of healthy adult men by 81 % . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are insufficient in terms of a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) .
ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin o@@ int@@ ment should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
&quot; when deciding whether breast@@ feeding should be continued / terminated or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated , the benefit of breast@@ feeding is to be considered for the infant and the benefit of alt@@ ar@@ go therapy for the woman . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials of 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections that have used Al@@ tar@@ go , the most commonly reported side effects of irrit@@ ation at the place of administration affecting approximately 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated from cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ wort ( previously P@@ lei@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ wort ) by fermentation . &quot;
the mode of action of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding points of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ ales Protein L@@ 3 is involved and is located in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the pep@@ tide transfer facility .
&quot; binding on this binding site inhi@@ bits the pep@@ tide transfer , partially blocking P @-@ binding inter@@ activity and prevents the normal formation of active ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; due to the local pre@@ valence of resistance , the application of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at least some infection forms may seem question@@ able , should seek advice by experts . &quot;
there were no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin compared to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us regardless of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; in the case of non @-@ response to treatment with S.@@ au@@ re@@ us , the presence of strains with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
resor@@ ption In a study with healthy adults 1 % Ret@@ ur@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be was applied daily under oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and reduced skin for up to 7 days .
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) , who received 1 % Ret@@ ur@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
samples were carried out on days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , maximum individual systemic absorption on humans after topical application of 1 % o@@ int@@ ment on 200 c@@ m2 shiel@@ ded skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP in@@ hibition . &quot;
&quot; metabol@@ ism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ism of retin@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , with less involvement of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) carried out over 14 days , there were indications of adap@@ tive liver and thy@@ roid changes . &quot;
in @-@ vitro examination based on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse @-@ lymph@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo analysis of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats signs of limited fertility at oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , thus reaching a maximum of 5 times higher exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 shiel@@ ded skin : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study of rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( corresponding to the ≥ 3 @-@ times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ ic@@ ity ( reduced body weight of the fet@@ us and delayed oscill@@ ation ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity established . &quot;

&quot; irrit@@ ation or other signs and symptoms at the treated place , you should end the application of Al@@ tar@@ go and talk to your doctor . &quot;
&quot; do not apply any other o@@ int@@ ments , cre@@ ams or l@@ oti@@ ons on the surface treated with Al@@ tar@@ go if you have not expressly been prescribed by your doctor . &quot;
&quot; it must not be applied in the eyes , at the mouth or on the lips , in the nose or in the female genital area . &quot;

Ambi@@ rix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between 1 and 15 who are not immune to these two diseases .
&quot; Ambi@@ rix is used as a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during imm@@ uni@@ zation and ensures that the vacc@@ ination plan existing from two doses can be brought to an end . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose against hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or another hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; act vacc@@ ines by contributing to the immune system ( the body &apos;s natural def@@ ences ) , as it can defend against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; alien &quot; and produces antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix contains the same components as the V@@ acc@@ ine , which has been approved since 1996 , and the vaccine approved since 1997 . &quot;
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are administered within the framework of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of three doses . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix adults contain identical ingredients , some of the data that support the application of Twin@@ rix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study involving 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six @-@ month period and a 12 @-@ month interval between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ rix conducted a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children .
the additional study showed that Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar in a six @-@ month period and a 12 @-@ month interval between the inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common adverse events of Ambi@@ rix ( observed in over 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , fatigue ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to the active substances , any of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
August 2002 the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals .
&quot; the standardi@@ zation plan for pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zing with Ambi@@ rix consists of two vacc@@ ines , whereby the first dose is given at the date of choice and the second dose is administered between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination for hepatitis A and hepatitis B is desired , vacc@@ ines can be vacc@@ inated with the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or with a combination vaccine . &quot;
the anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) - and anti @-@ hepatitis A @-@ Virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) antibody levels are in the same size as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully assured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have responded to a Hepatitis A@@ - vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ her as protection since they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 . as with all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should be immediately available for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ kia reaction after the application of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a quick protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in case of ha@@ em@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with disorders of the immune system , insufficient anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody levels are under certain circumstances , so that in these cases the gift of further vacc@@ ines can be required . &quot;
&quot; since intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscles could lead to a sub@@ optimal success , these inj@@ ections should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; however , in cases of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or coag@@ ulation disorders , however , Ambi@@ rix can be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously as it may occur in these cases after intra@@ muscular administration to ble@@ ed@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered in the form of a separate injection simultaneously with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , ac@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ e- , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or with a combined meas@@ ur@@ ing- m@@ um@@ ps @-@ ro@@ ach vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient ( see Section 5.1 ) . &quot;
patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects must assume that there may be no adequate immune response .
&quot; in a clinical study carried out with 3 vacc@@ ines of this formulation in adults , the incidence of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ur@@ ation , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , head@@ aches and fever was comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ os@@ sal and preser@@ v@@ ative vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vaccine doses have been given to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 @-@ including 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants aged 12 and 15 , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ rix was compared with that of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequencies of pain and fatigue on a calculation basis per acc@@ ine dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
&quot; pain was observed after the administration of Ambi@@ rix in 5@@ 0.1 % of the subjects , compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in the subjects after the dose of a 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6,@@ 4 % of the volunteers who had given Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % for the test persons , who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ography was comparable high per pro@@ band ( i.e. about the whole vaccine cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of the subjects who got Ambi@@ rix , compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of severe pain and fatigue was small and comparable to that observed after administration of the combination vaccine with the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination regi@@ men .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ gruppe was comparable to that observed in administration with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; for the 6@@ - to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds , however , after vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , was reported . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ ines , which reported severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix , or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination chem@@ a with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen , was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 @-@ including 15 years , serum levels for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
serum conversion rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % a month after the first dose and 100 % a month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) .
&quot; 7 In a comparative study carried out at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combin@@ ant with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immunity was worth@@ less , the serum sample rates ( SP in the table below ) against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 were significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
immune responses received in a clinical comparative study of 1 to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) are listed in the following table .
in both studies the vaccine was either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination with a combination vaccine with 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen .
&quot; in people who were between 12 and 15 years old at the time of pri@@ ori@@ ti@@ zing , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ h@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 months . &quot;
the immun@@ reaction observed in this study was comparable to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine consisting of 360 ELISA units of form @-@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml .
&quot; in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , it was shown that the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies is comparable 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation in the 0 @-@ 6 months &quot; vacc@@ ination scheme . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the refres@@ her of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eria , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ is@@ e- , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis and 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response to all anti@@ gens was sufficient . &quot;
a clinical study carried out with 3 doses of current formulation in adults showed similar serum and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ sions similar to the previous formulation .
the vaccine is examined both before and after res@@ us@@ ur@@ ation to any foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted through viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as bathing in the waters contaminated by wastewater . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , a pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may necess@@ itate a stationary treatment . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix does not fully protect the virus from infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus , even if the complete vacc@@ ination series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child are already infected with hepatitis B or hepatitis B virus before ad@@ minist@@ ering both V@@ acc@@ ines Ambi@@ rix ( although you / your child may not feel uncomfortable or ill / feel ) an ino@@ cul@@ ation may not prevent a disease .
&quot; protection against other infections that damage the liver or cause symptoms similar to those after a Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B infection , cannot be medi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; • If your child has already shown an allergic reaction to ambient rix , or any part of this vaccine , including Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; an allergic reaction may manifest itself by it@@ ching skin rash , breathing difficulty or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or Hepatitis B , if you / your child have a severe infection with fever . &quot;
• If you want to quickly have a protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. within 6 months and before the normally scheduled dose of the second vacc@@ ination dose ) .
&quot; at a possible risk of hepatitis B infection between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
instead it will recommend you / your child 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with reduced levels of effective constitu@@ ents per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of a re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface ) .
the second vacc@@ ination dose of this vaccine with decreased content of effective components is usually given a month after the first dose and should give your child a vacc@@ ination protection prior to the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ rix is inj@@ ected in people who suffer from severe blood cl@@ ot@@ ting disorders , under the skin and not into the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to a disease or treatment in your body &apos;s defense or if you / your child undergo hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ rix can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals to vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test can be required to see how strongly the response to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Sa@@ y your doctor if you / your child take other medicines ( including those you have received without prescription ) or if you have been vacc@@ inated or have been given immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or have been planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and therefore the person is not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine has to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ rix , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate places and as various limbs as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix is to be given at the same time or shortly before or after an injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will still be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; normally , Ambi@@ rix will not be given pregnant or breast@@ feeding women unless it is strongly required that they are vacc@@ inated against Hepatitis A and Hepatitis B . &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ rix Please tell your doctor if your child has already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) .
&quot; if you miss the appointment for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new appointment as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very common ( more than 1 case per 10 dil@@ uted doses ) : • pain or discomfort at the in@@ stit@@ ch or redness • Mat@@ eness • irrit@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ often ( up to 1 case per 10 dil@@ uted doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • di@@ zz@@ iness • gastro@@ intestinal symptoms
&quot; further side effects , which have been reported very rarely for days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or single vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and Hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 doses ) are : &quot;
&quot; these include locally restricted or extended le@@ ashes that may or may be pu@@ zz@@ led , swelling of the eye part and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure loss and un@@ consciousness . &quot;
&quot; flu @-@ like symptoms , including ch@@ ills , muscular and joint pain , sei@@ zur@@ es , di@@ zz@@ iness , mal@@ sens@@ ations such as ting@@ ling and &quot; ants running , &quot; multiple sclerosis , disorders of the optic nerve , loss of sensation or mus@@ cul@@ ability of some body parts , strong head@@ aches and stiff@@ ness of the neck , inter@@ ruption of normal brain functions &quot;
&quot; f@@ ain@@ ting inflammation of some blood vessels causes discomfort or disease , loss of appetite , diar@@ rho@@ ea , and abdominal pain Change liver function tests lymph@@ atic no@@ des causing increased inclin@@ ation to bleeding or bru@@ ising ( bru@@ ises ) caused by waste of the quantity of blood . &quot;
23 Inform@@ ing your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects will significantly affect you / your child or notice any side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; based on the data that has been known since the initial approval for the market , CH@@ MP has shown that the benefits @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , as Ambi@@ rix has only been placed in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available security data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
am@@ mon@@ osis can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ exhaus@@ tive enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ et en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage as a result of high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in the pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is - split into several single doses at meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ y ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach of leading tube ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading tube ) . &quot;
&quot; this was not a comparative study , because ammon@@ ia could not be compared with another treatment or with placebo ( a placebo , i.e. without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , fla@@ ws or fla@@ vor@@ ing , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , uncomfortable body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that ammon@@ ia in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ eed was approved under &quot; &quot; exceptional circumstances &quot; , &quot; because only limited information was available to this drug due to the r@@ arity of the disease at the time of approval . &quot;
the use is indicated in all patients where a complete lack of enzyme already mani@@ f@@ ests in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 live days ) .
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ mani@@ able form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first month of life ) there is an indication for use when a hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy exists in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually with regard to protein tolerance and the daily protein intake of the patient for the growth and development .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ read@@ scar@@ can@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with an ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ ase deficiency must obtain ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with swal@@ lowing disorders , as there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be applied only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and with sodium retention and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; since Met@@ abol@@ ism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat occurs over the liver and kidneys , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used in patients with liver or kidney failure only with extreme caution . &quot;
the importance of these results in pregnant women is unknown ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons occurred . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and thus a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans into breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during lac@@ tation ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS at least 56 % of patients had at least an unwanted event ( AE ) and 78 % of these un@@ desirable events were considered that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS .
&quot; frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1,000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank @-@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of an over@@ dose occurred in a 5 month old infant with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms are associated with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate that showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity with intraven@@ ous dos@@ ages of doses up to 400 mg / kg / day .
&quot; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ li@@ cal active compound , which is con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine by acet@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted through the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen . &quot;
5 patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be believed to be produced for each gram of di@@ ced sodium poly@@ but@@ yl rate between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen .
the assumption of full take @-@ up tends to exagger@@ ate the simulated increase in cas@@ elo@@ ads and fiscal costs of a social policy reform .
the pre@@ diction of the early manifest form of the disease with the onset of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st and the disease itself led to death in treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
&quot; due to hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the use of alternative ways of nit@@ ric secre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced diet and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first months of life ) to increase to 80 % . &quot;
patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and that were already treated before the first onset of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy was 100 % survival rate but even in these patients it came with time for many to mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its .
&quot; patients with a late @-@ mani@@ able form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of or@@ ni@@ th@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , who recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and were subsequently treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , was 98 % . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible , and a further worsen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur in some patients . &quot;
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidney enzy@@ mati@@ cally with glut@@ amine , with phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rate and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine have been determined after a single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin metabolism and liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , as well as repeated gifts of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also studied in cancer patients following an intraven@@ ous dose of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were measured 15 minutes after taking . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with urine cy@@ c@@ lic disorders or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glo@@ bin@@ opath@@ ies , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) was det@@ ectable in the next morning after ni@@ gh@@ tly fasting no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in the plasma . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of liver cir@@ rho@@ sis , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the mean phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in plasma gas were five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;
ex@@ cre@@ tion The medication is ex@@ cre@@ ted within 24 hours to about 80 - 100 % in the form of the con@@ ju@@ gated product phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine over the kidneys .
&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat did not have any compla@@ ined effects on toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of a single dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS Gran@@ ules are either taken or@@ ally ( infants and children , who cannot swallow tablets , or patients with swal@@ lowing disorders ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ y or a nas@@ al probe . &quot;
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in new@@ bor@@ ns , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13.@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg and in adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched @-@ chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum proteins in the plasma should be held within the normal range . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ yl phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ th@@ read@@ scar@@ can@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5,@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat , according to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rats were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before birth , les@@ ions were found in the pyramid cells of the cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; a prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by an 18 year old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient , which developed a metabolic en@@ cephal@@ opathy associated with lac@@ tate , heavy hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank @-@ top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
&quot; as a result , phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is comparable to ure@@ a ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess solvents . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of investigations on the ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , it can be assumed that for each gram , the mon@@ oso@@ dium glut@@ amine is produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine nitrogen . &quot;
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible , and a further worsen@@ ing of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur in some patients . &quot;
&quot; after an oral single dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ulate form , measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were measured 15 minutes after taking . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of the life , the patient can store the finished product once for a period of 3 months at a temperature of not more than 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; the small measuring spoon of 0,@@ 95 g , the medium measuring spoon is 2,@@ 9 g and the large measuring spoon of 8.@@ 6 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medicine by a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rate is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot secre@@ te the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after eating proteins . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
&quot; during breast@@ feeding , you may not use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as the medicine may go to breast milk and harm your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , fla@@ ws , re@@ visions of hearing , dis@@ orientation , memory disorders and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions were observed . &quot;
&quot; if you notice any of these symptoms , contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initi@@ ating appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you miss the dose of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood image ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , impotence , irrit@@ ability , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , uncomfortable skin odor , rash , ren@@ al dysfunction , weight gain , and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects may be significantly affected or you notice side effects that are not stated in this use information .
&quot; after the exp@@ iry date , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can no longer use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS according to the exp@@ iry date specified on the cart@@ on and the container . &quot;
&quot; like AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS and the content of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of white color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out , you must inform the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS as sodium phen@@ yl but@@ y@@ rat can affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines , please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you take other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription drugs . &quot;
you should admini@@ ster AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS to the same single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ st@@ l ( hose which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
&quot; • Rem@@ ove from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Att@@ ach a straight edge , e.g. a knife press over the rim of the measuring spoon to remove excess gran@@ ulate . • The amount remaining in the measuring spoon is equivalent to a measuring spoon . • Take the recommended number of spo@@ on@@ ful gran@@ ules from the container . &quot;
&quot; Angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with &quot; acute cor@@ on@@ ary syn@@ dro@@ mes &quot; ( AC@@ S , decreased blood supply to the heart ) , for example in inst@@ able ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different strength ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; stress &quot; &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value in electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; if it is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients receiving a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14@@ ,000 patients participated in the main study of the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox was compared with either a dose or in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI , another drug for the prevention of blood cl@@ ots ) with the traditional combination treatment with he@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during PCI , the patient was often used as a st@@ ent ( a short tube remaining in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and they additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as ab@@ ci@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or rev@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a whole year as much as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from a PCI , angi@@ ox was as effective in terms of all indicators just as effective as he@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding in which it was significantly more effective than he@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , other Hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other components . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had a bleeding , as well as for people with severe hyper@@ tension or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox in the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI is an acceptable replacement for he@@ par@@ in .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted authorization to the company The Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( inst@@ ab@@ ile ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST traction inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) ) in case of an emergency call or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous dosage of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
an additional bol@@ us of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h .
&quot; according to the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be recorded for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the procedure , a measurement of 0.5 mg / kg is to be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the procedure . &quot;
the recommended dosage of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous injection of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and an intraven@@ ous intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg of body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a sole Bol@@ us gift of angi@@ ox has not been studied and is not recommended even if a short PCI en@@ cro@@ achment is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0,3 mg / kg / body weight should take place . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drug should be carefully bl@@ ended before application and intraven@@ ously administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is administered properly . &quot;
a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1.4 mg / kg / h should be used in patients with severe ren@@ al function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) .
&quot; if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second half dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be administered and the ACT 5 minutes after the second half dose again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with severe kidney damage , which were included in the Phase II@@ I@@ - PCI @-@ study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which was approved for approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after receiving the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average of 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients suffering from severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after completion of the intraven@@ ous administration of un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after completion of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular lifting .
• known hyper@@ sensitivity to the active ingredient or other components or against Hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased risk of bleeding due to a distur@@ b@@ ance of hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible bacterial end@@ ophthal@@ mi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and in di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially when bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if in case of PCI @-@ patients under Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din most bleeding can occur at arter@@ ial pun@@ cture points , in patients undergoing a per@@ cut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) , bleeding can occur in principle everywhere . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving War@@ far@@ in and treated with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R value ( International Reg@@ ular R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din is once again reached the level before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on knowledge about the mechanism of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tic or Th@@ rom@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ation@@ sh@@ em@@ mer ) , these agents may increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in the combination of bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ines with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregate numbers or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters can be checked regularly . &quot;
&quot; animal experimental studies are inadequate in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , child@@ birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine alone , 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ised to either un@@ frac@@ tion@@ ated he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or . &quot;
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group as well as in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women and patients over 65 years of experience than in male or younger patients .
severe bleeding has been defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups with he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or and Bi@@ vali@@ dru@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a- In@@ hibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; AC@@ U@@ ITY major hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ≥ 4 g / dl with a known bleeding edge , reduction of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror of ≥ 3 g / dl with a known bleeding point , re@@ operation due to bleeding , use of blood products for trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; further , less frequently observed loc@@ aliz@@ ations occurring in more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) were &quot; other &quot; pun@@ cture points , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information on side effects is based on data from a clinical trial with Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
both in the Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din group as well as in the comparative groups treated with he@@ par@@ in were more common in women and patients over 65 years of experience than in male or younger patients .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in the comparison group under he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , have been reported in practice after extensive use and are grouped by system organ@@ ics in Table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ ines is immediately broken down and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ ocular inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both to the cataly@@ tic center as well as on the ani@@ on @-@ binding region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or in cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din to Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , and therefore its effect , is rever@@ sible because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , which re@@ generates the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din had no thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ in@@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , Bi@@ Vali@@ ru@@ din is showing a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is demonstrated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the patient following a PCI , an additional bol@@ us of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery is increased to 1.@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
in the arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study un@@ fac@@ tional he@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with inst@@ able ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST traction inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) .
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ized to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or in PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , requiring angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were spread evenly over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; about 77 % of patients had a recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EC@@ G changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 @-@ day and the 1- yearly end@@ point for the total population ( IT@@ T ) and for patients who received aspir@@ in and Clo@@ pi@@ do@@ gre@@ l according to protocol ( before angi@@ ography or before PCI ) are shown in tables 7 and 8 .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or that insulin can not be processed effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very little from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has shorter active life than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in the application in combination with a long @-@ lasting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; for type 2 diabetes , where the body is unable to use insulin effectively , A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
in the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) was observed compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % in insulin .
in adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease of H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin .
A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin or any of the other ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
the doses of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission granted approval to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the marketing of A@@ pi@@ dra throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; as a sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall , the thi@@ ghs or the delta muscle or to apply sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously through continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the abdominal wall . &quot;
&quot; due to the reduced glucose capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism , the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function . &quot;
&quot; any change of effectiveness , the brand ( creator ) , the insulin type ( normal , N@@ PH , z@@ ink@@ lag etc . ) , the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the production method can pull a change in the insulin demand . &quot;
&quot; 3 An insufficient dosage or abor@@ tion of a treatment , in particular in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis . these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
&quot; the conversion of a patient to another insulin type , or an insulin produced by another manufacturer , should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage necessary . &quot;
the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia depends on the operating profile of the used insulin and can therefore be changed when changing the treatment scheme .
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar reduction activity and increase the inclin@@ ation to hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia include oral anti@@ diabe@@ tics , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ Con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibit@@ ors , Dis@@ op@@ y@@ ramid , Fi@@ br@@ ate , Flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , Pro@@ po@@ xy@@ yl , S@@ aliz@@ yl@@ ate and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , symptoms of adren@@ ergi@@ c counter @-@ regulation can be weakened or absent under the effect of symp@@ athetic disorders such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ ane@@ thi@@ din and Reser@@ pin . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ in and human insulin in terms of pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see Section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin stimulates the human breast milk , but in general insulin is not absorbed into breast milk , nor is it resor@@ bed after oral application . &quot;
&quot; listed below are listed in clinical studies , grouped by system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 100 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; cold @-@ sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or tre@@ mor , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration difficulties , ligh@@ the@@ ade@@ dness , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Wir@@ d fails to change the injection area within the injection area , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia with un@@ consciousness can be treated with an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glucose ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by an appropriately trained person or treated with intraven@@ ous glucose by a doctor .
&quot; following a glucose injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake ( in particular through skel@@ etal mus@@ cul@@ ature and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that a sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ - be of insulin recept@@ ors takes place faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu@@ - man@@ em normal insulin .
&quot; in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes , insulin doses of 0,@@ 0@@ 75 to 0,@@ 15 E / kg showed a proportional amount of glu@@ cos@@ al effect , and 0.3 E / kg or more a low @-@ proportional increase in the glu@@ cos@@ al effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin .
&quot; the data showed that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a comparable post@@ pran@@ dial gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is reached like with a human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; for 2 minutes before the meal , insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ was obtained in 2 minutes before the meal , and a better postoperative control than with the human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin doses are applied in 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a comparable gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control such as the human@@ ized normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ - nu@@ ds before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) , is achieved . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at gift 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - before ) before the beginning of the meal , compared to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes before the start of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at a dose of 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human nor@@ - mal@@ aria that was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) .
