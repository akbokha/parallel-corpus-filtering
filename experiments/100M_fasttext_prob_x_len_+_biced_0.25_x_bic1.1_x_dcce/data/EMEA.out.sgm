<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution for taking (1 mg / ml) and an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. wirl thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), mistrust and delusion; • Bipolar-I disorder, a mental illness in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high spirits) alternating with periods of normal mood."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have responded to the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased unrest or behavioural disturbance if the oral intake of the drug is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both cases, the solution for taking or the melting tablets can be applied to patients with difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"for patients who are taking other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this interferes with signal transmission between brain cells through" neurotransmitters, "i.e. chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazl probably acts primarily as a "partial agonist" for the receptors for neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazl acts as 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but in a lesser extent than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"since dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazole contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, which reduces psychotic or manic symptoms and prevents its recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">The effectiveness of Abilify to prevent recurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">The efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases that suffered from increased anxiety over a period of two hours with a placebo.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study Abilify was compared to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo to prevent recurrence of 160 patients in which the manic symptoms had already been stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared to 301 patients with bipolar disorder, suffering from increased unrest, compared to Lorazepam (another antipsychotic drug) and placebo over a period of two hours."</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in patients "symptoms based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients responding to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also carried out studies to investigate how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to take up (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg or 15 mg, showed a significantly greater reduction in symptoms of increased anxiety than the patients receiving a placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effectively than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in addition, Abilify prevented the recurrence of some episodes from previously treated patients for up to 74 weeks and when it was administered in addition to an existing treatment."</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses also significantly reduced the symptoms of increased unrest and were similar to lauazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled), somnolence (nausea), headache, blurred vision, nausea, vomiting (increased saliva production), fatigue and exhaustion, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder and in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who spoke mostly of manic episodes, and in which the manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazole versus the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the Committee concluded that the benefits of the injection solution in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, if oral therapy is not appropriate, outweigh the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission issued a license to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes on the treatment with Aripiprazole (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day regardless of the meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased effectiveness in dosages over a daily dose of 15 mg has not been proven, although individual patients may benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once daily, regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this patient group, a lower initial dose should be considered if clinical factors justify this (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the recommended dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or after menopause, also in treatment with Aripiprazl (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no higher suicide risk with Aripiprazl compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with well-known cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that predispose for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolmia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including accelerized and maligne form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials lasting one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia appearing during treatment with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if signs and symptoms of late dyskinesia occur in a patient treated with Abilify, should be considered to reduce the dose or cancel treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a mns, or has unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be dismissed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazl should be used in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or at states associated with seizures."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazl in patients with psychoses associated with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of mortality compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there was in one of these studies, a study with a fixed dosage, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazole."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolarem coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic agents, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycemia related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic agents that allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsy, polyurie, polyphagia and weakness are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and in patients with bipolar disorders, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effect, and may lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary effect of Aripiprazole on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazl is taken in combination with alcohol or other centrally-effective medicines with overlapping side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazole, but this effect is considered clinically irrelevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical study with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC from Aripiprazole by 107%, while the CMAX remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"it is expected that other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, such as fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolisers, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazole in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers."</seg>
<seg id="53">"if you consider the joint gift of ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4-inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should outweigh the potential risks for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4, such as Itraconazole and HIV-proteaseinase inhibitors, are likely to have similar effects and therefore similar dosages should be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="55">"after replacing the CYP2D6- or 3A4-inhibitor, the dosage of Abilify should be raised to the dosage height before starting the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or Escitalopram) or CYP2D6 to be administered together with Abilify can be calculated with a moderate increase in arithmetic concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazole per day did not show a significant effect on the metabolism of the substrates of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine-Ratio), 2C19 (Omebozol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorphan)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or plan pregnancy during treatment with Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data situation for safety in humans and due to the concerns that arise in the animal reproduction studies, this drug may not be used in pregnancy, unless the potential benefits justify the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against using dangerous machines, including motor vehicles, until they are certain that Aripiprazl has no negative impact on them."</seg>

<seg id="70">"CPK increases (creatine phosphokinase), generally temporary and asymptomatic, were observed at 3.5% of patients treated with Aripiprazole compared to 2.0% of patients treated with placebo."</seg>
<seg id="71">"adverse events associated with antipsychotic therapy have been reported to include maligne neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and seizures, undesirable cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintended or deliberate overdoses were observed with Aripiprazl alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without deaths."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information about the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazole, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose, since Aripiprazole has a high plasma protein binding."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is believed that the efficacy of Aripiprazl in schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder is mediated by the combination of a partial agonist effect on dopamine di- and serotonin 5HT1- receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Aripiprazl showed in vitro a high affinity to dopamine D and D3 receptor and serotonin 5HT1- and 5HT2a receptors as well as a moderate affinity to dopamine D4-, serotonin 5HT2c- and 5HTC, to alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor."</seg>

<seg id="82">In two placebo-controlled monotherapy trials with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks.</seg>
<seg id="83">In a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dosage with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar I disorder Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo.</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active-controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazole showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a maintenance effect comparable to that of lithium or semi-surgery in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">Aripiprazole also showed in week 12 a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of mania such as lithium or neck surgery.</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study over 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic symptoms, which sometimes did not affect lithium or valproat monotherapy in therapeutic serum levels, the companion therapy with Aripiprazl revealed superior effectiveness in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>
<seg id="87">"10 In a placebo-controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long-term enlargement phase over 74 weeks in manic patients who had achieved remission with Aripiprazl during a stabilization phase before randomization, Aripiprazl showed himself superior to the prevention of a bipolar reverse, mainly in preventing a decline in the mania."</seg>
<seg id="88">"based on in vitro studies, the enzymes CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 are responsible for the Dehydration and hydroxyulation of Aripiprazole, the N-dealkyylation is catalyzed by CYP3A4."</seg>
<seg id="89">The mean elimination time is approximately 75 hours for Aripiprazl in extensive metabolisers on CYP2D6 and about 146 hours at 'bad' (= "poor") metabolisers on CYP2D6.</seg>
<seg id="90">"in Aripiprazl, there are no differences in pharmacokinetics between male and female healthy volunteers, and in a pharmacokinetic study schizophrenic patients did not show any gender-dependent effects."</seg>
<seg id="91">A simulation-specific evaluation of pharmacokinetics did not show clinically significant differences in regard to ethnic origin or the impact of smoking on the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole.</seg>
<seg id="92">The pharmacokinetic properties of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole were similar in patients with severe renal insufficiency compared to young healthy volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="93">"a single dose study involving subjects with varying liver cirrhosis (Child-Pugh class A, B and C) showed no significant effect on liver function affecting the pharmacokinetics of Aripiprazole and Dehydro-Aripiprazole, but the study included only 3 patients with liver cirrhosis of class C, which is not sufficient to draw conclusions on their metabolic capacity."</seg>
<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies on safety-harmacology, toxicity with repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity and the carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not allow any particular risks to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were observed only in doses or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no meaning for clinical use."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects contained a dose-dependent adrenal toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal cell loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to 3 to 10 times the average steady state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose for humans.</seg>

<seg id="302">Paclitaxel is an anti-microtubules compound that promotes the contraction of the microtubules from the tubules and stabilises microtubules by inhibiting their demodularization.</seg>
<seg id="303">"this stabilization leads to an inhibition of the normal dynamic reorganization of the microtubular network, which is essential for the vital interphase and the mitotic cell functions."</seg>
<seg id="304">It is known that albumin conveys the transcytosis of plasma components into endothelial cells and in the course of in-vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of albumin promotes the transport of paclitaxel with endothelial cells.</seg>
<seg id="305">It is assumed that this improved transcendothelial transport is mediated by the gp-60-albuminrezeptor and occurs due to the albuminous protein SPARC (secreted protein acidic rich in cysteine) in the area of the tumor.</seg>

<seg id="750">Actos is used to treat type 2 diabetes (also known as non-insulin-dependent diabetes). • It can be used alone (monotherapy) in patients (especially overweight patients) where metformin (a diabetes drug) is not displayed.</seg>
<seg id="751">"it can be applied in addition to metformin in patients (especially overweight patients), which cannot be satisfactorily adjusted with metformin alone in the highest tolerable dose."</seg>
<seg id="752">"in combination with a sulphonyl resin or insulin, the previous dose of sulfonyl resin or insulin can be maintained with the beginning of the acetyl treatment, except in patients with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); here, the dose of sulfonyl resin or insulin should be reduced."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this means that the body's insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases, which makes type 2 diabetes more adjustable."</seg>
<seg id="754">"in more than 1,400 patients the efficacy of Actos was studied in tripletherapy; the patients received a combination of metformin with a sulfonic resin, in addition they received either Actos or placebo for up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="755">"in the studies, the concentration of a substance in the blood (glycosylated haemoglobin, HbA1c) was measured, indicating how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="756">"Actos resulted in a decrease in the HbA1c value, which indicates that the blood glucose levels were reduced by 15 mg, 30 mg, and 45 mg doses."</seg>
<seg id="757">"at the end of the tripletherapy study, the effect of the additional administration of Actos for the existing treatment with metformin and a sulphonyl-resin showed a reduction of the HbA1c values by 0.94%, while the additional administration of placebo led to a reduction of 0.35%."</seg>
<seg id="758">"in a small study where the combination of Actos and insulin was examined in 289 patients, the patients who took Actos in addition to insulin showed reduced HbA1c values of 0.69% after 6 months, compared to 0.14% in patients who additionally took placebo."</seg>
<seg id="759">"the most common side effects related to Actos were visual disturbances, upper respiratory tract infections (colds), weight gain and hypogethesia (reduced sensitivity to stimuli)."</seg>
<seg id="760">"Actos may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to Pioglitazone or any of the other components, nor in patients with liver problems, heart failure or diabetic ketoacidosis (high ketone levels - acid levels in the blood)."</seg>
<seg id="761">It has been decided that Actos should be used as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin in patients with metformin as an alternative to standard treatment with metformin.</seg>

<seg id="804">In clinical trials over a year under Pioglitazon a statistically significant decrease of the Albumin / Kreatinin quotient was shown in comparison to the baseline values.</seg>
<seg id="805">The effect of Pioglitazon (monotherapy with 45 mg versus placebo) was tested in a small examination of type 2 diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="806">"in most clinical trials, compared to placebo, a reduction of the total plasma triglycerides and free fatty acids and an increase in HDL cholesterol as well as slight, but clinically not significantly increased LDL- cholesterol levels were observed."</seg>
<seg id="807">"in clinical trials over a period of up to two years, Pioglitazone reduced the overall plasglyceride and the free fatty acids and increased HDL cholesterol levels compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="808">"compared to placebo, there was no statistically significant increase in LDL Cholesterinspiegel in Pioglitazon, while Metformin and Gliclazide were observed."</seg>
<seg id="809">"in a study over 20 weeks, Pioglitazon reduced not only the Nüchtern triglycerides, but also improved the postprandial increased triglyceride level, which has an effect on triglyceride absorption as well as the hepatic triglyceride synthesis."</seg>
<seg id="810">"in the ProActive study, a cardiovascular outcome study, 5238 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and pre-existing advanced macular vascular disease were randomized in groups who received either pioglitazone or placebo over a period of up to 3.5 years."</seg>
<seg id="811">"after oral application, pioglitazone is quickly resorbed, whereby the top concentrations of unmodified pioglitazone in the plasma are usually achieved 2 hours after application."</seg>
<seg id="812">"on this basis, the contribution of M-IV is equivalent to the effectiveness of about three times the efficacy of pioglitazone, whereas the relative effectiveness of M-II is minimal."</seg>

<seg id="1656">"for adults and adolescents from 12 years of age, the recommended dose of Aerinaze is twice a day a tablet that should be taken with a glass of water with or without food."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and stop as soon as the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are cluttered."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the drug can be reduced to constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main efficacy measurements were the changes in the severity of hay fever symptoms which were reported by the patients prior to the treatment and during 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">"during the study, patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and assessed using a standard scale, how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours."</seg>
<seg id="1661">"when considering all hay fever symptoms except for constipation of the nose, patients who received aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudo-ephedrine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"if only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was seen, the patients showed a relief of 37.4% compared to 26.7% compared to 26.7% in patients receiving desloratadin alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most common side effects of Aerinaze (observed at 1 to 10 of 100 patients) are tachycardia, dizziness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (lack of appetite), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleeplessness), somnolence (sleeplessness), somnolence and nervousness."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to desloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or lauatadin (another medicine for treating allergies)."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"aerinaze may not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow-angle glaucoma (increased intraocular pressure), urinary retention (hypertension), hyperthyreose (hyperthyrophy), hyperthyreose (hyperthyrosis), or a risk of hemorrhagic stroke."</seg>
<seg id="1666">"on 30 July 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aerinaze throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1667">"the tablet can be taken with a glass of water, but can be swallowed whole (i.e. without debiting, breaking or chewing)."</seg>
<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be applied to children under 12 years of age due to lack of data for safety and efficacy (see Section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after listening to the symptoms.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long-term use may decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"after the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, the treatment can continue with desloratadin as monotherapy if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"since Aerinaze contains Pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor or within the 2 weeks after termination of such therapy."</seg>
<seg id="1673">"this is attributable to alphamimetic activity in combined use of pseudoephedrine with other vasoconstrictors such as bromocripitin, pergolid, Lisurid, cabergolin, ergotamine, aphrodisiacs, phenymetazoline, naphrodisiacs etc.)."</seg>

<seg id="1750">"since histamine extraction is a causal factor in all urticaria diseases, desloratadin is expected to improve the symptoms except for the chronic idiopathic urticaria. this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines."</seg>
<seg id="1751">"in two placebo-controlled trials over 6 weeks in patients with chronic idiopathic urticaria, Aerius was effective in the improvement of Pruritus and the reduction of size and number of squares at the end of the first dose interval."</seg>

<seg id="1972">Therefore the dose of Efavirenz in combination with amprenavir (600 mg twice daily) and Ritonavir (100 mg twice daily) is not necessary dosage adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="1973">Treatment with Efavirenz combined with amprenavir and saquinavir is not recommended as the exposure of both protease inhibitors is low.</seg>
<seg id="1974">The effect of nevirapine on other protease inhibitors and existing limited data suggest that nevirapine may reduce the serum concentration of ammonia.</seg>

<seg id="1976">"if these drugs are used together, caution is required; thorough clinical and virological monitoring should be carried out, as a precise prediction of the effect of the combination of amprenavir and ritonavir on delavirdine is difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The simultaneous administration of ammonia and rifabutin led to an increase in plasma concentrations (AUC) of rifabutin by 193% and thus to an increase in the side effects associated with fabutin.</seg>
<seg id="1978">"if it is necessary for clinical reasons to administer rifabutin together with asgenerase, a reduction of the dosage of rifabutin is recommended to at least half of the recommended dose, although no clinical data is available."</seg>
<seg id="1979">"pharmacokinetic studies with asterase in combination with erythromycin were not carried out, but the plasma levels of both drugs could be increased in the case of simultaneous administration."</seg>
<seg id="1980">Simultaneous application of twice daily 700 mg of Fosamprenavir and 100 mg of ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the CMAx of ketoconazole in the plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-τ) to the 2.69age compared to the value observed once a day without simultaneous use of Fosamprenavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"other medicines listed below, including substrates, inhibitors or inductors of CYP3A4 can, if applied together with Ageneric, may lead to interactions."</seg>

<seg id="1987">"in a clinical study where Ritonavir 100 mg capsules were given twice a day together with 50 µg Fluticasonpropionate intranasal (4 times a day) over 7 days of subjects, the fluticasonpropionate plasma levels increased significantly, while the endogenous cortisol decreased by about 86% (90% confidence interval 82 to 89%)."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"as a result, the simultaneous administration of asgenerase with Ritonavir is not recommended along with these glucocorticoids, unless the possible benefits of treatment outweigh the risk of systemic corticosteroidal effects (see Section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1989">"for HMG CoA reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, pronounced increases in plasma levels are expected at the same time administering asgenerase."</seg>

<seg id="1991">"more frequent monitoring of therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirrors is recommended, since the plasma concentrations of cyclosporine, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased with the simultaneous administration of ammonia (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1992">"therefore, Agenerators should not be used together with orally recorded midazolam (see section 4.3), while at the same time it is advisable to use parenteral midazolam."</seg>

<seg id="1996">"with simultaneous administration of warfarin or other oral anticoagulants along with asgenerase, increased control of the INR (International Regular Ratio) is recommended because of the possibility of weakening or strengthening the antithrombotic effect (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"the effect of an additional administration of ritonavir on hormonal contraceptives is not predictable, therefore alternative methods of contraception are recommended."</seg>
<seg id="1998">Careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tricyclic antidepressants (for example Desipramine and Nortryptilin) is recommended with simultaneous administration of aquiase (see Section 4.4).</seg>

<seg id="2047">The apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l (6 l / kg at a weight of 70 kg) and can be connected to a large distribution volume as well as an unimpeded penetration of amodynamavir from the blood stream into the tissue.</seg>

<seg id="2660">"in June 2006, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Medicinal Products (CHMP) approved a negative report in which the licensing of the approval for the placing of the medicine prescribed for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended 6 million IE / ml injection solution."</seg>
<seg id="2661">"this means that alpheleon should resemble a biological drug called Roferon-A with the same dentist, which is already approved in the EU (also known as" reference drug ")."</seg>

<seg id="2665">"the manufacturer of Alpheleon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of Alpheleon with Roferon-A (active ingredient structure, composition and purity of the medicine, effectiveness, safety and efficacy in hepatitis C)."</seg>
<seg id="2666">"in the study on patients with hepatitis C, the efficacy of Alphaco was compared with the efficacy of the reference doctor in 455 patients."</seg>

<seg id="2669">"in addition, concerns have been expressed that data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed is not sufficient."</seg>
<seg id="2670">The number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with Alphelon and Roferon-A was similar in clinical study.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"after the treatment with Alpheon, the disease worsened again with more patients than with the reference drug agent; in addition, Alpheleon had more side effects."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"apart from this, the test used in the study to examine the question to what extent the drug triggers an immune response (i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the drug) is not sufficiently validated."</seg>
<seg id="2673">"it can be used for the treatment of impetigo (a skin infection associated with crust formation) and small infected infirmations (crack or cut wounds), abrasions and sewn wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2674">"Altargo should not be used for the treatment of infections that have been proven to be demonstrable or probably caused by methicillinic Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), because Alargo may not have an effect against this type of infection."</seg>
<seg id="2675">"Altargo can be applied to patients from the age of nine months, but in patients under 18 years of age, the skin surface to be treated must not exceed 2% of the body surface."</seg>
<seg id="2676">"if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days, the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments."</seg>
<seg id="2677">It works by blocking the bacterial ribosomes (the parts of the bacterial cell in which proteins are produced) and thus inhibits the growth of bacteria.</seg>
<seg id="2678">The main indicator of efficacy was in all five studies the proportion of patients whose infection was accrued at the end of the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2679">"119 (85,6%) of the 139 patients under Altargo and 37 (52.1%) of 71 patients under placebo referred to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"in the treatment of infected skin wounds, Altargo and Cefalexin showed similar response rates: when the results of both studies were taken together at Hautwonds, about 90% of the patients of both groups responded to the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2681">"however, in these two studies, Altargo was not effective enough in the treatment of abscesses (ice-filled cavities in the body) or from infections which were demonstrably or presumably caused by MRSA."</seg>
<seg id="2682">The most common side effect with Altargo (which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients) is a irritation at the site.</seg>
<seg id="2683">"the Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Altargo in short-term treatment of the following superficial skin infections outweigh the risks: • Impetigo, • infected small infirmations, abrasions or stitched wounds."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in May 2007, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Glaxo Group Ltd. approval for the transport of Altargo throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2685">Patients with no improvement within two to three days should be examined and an alternative therapy can be considered (see section 4.4).</seg>
<seg id="2686">"in case of sensitization or severe local irritation by applying reapamulin ointment, the treatment should be aborted, the ointment is carefully wiped and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"retinapamulin is not intended to treat infections, where MRSA is known as a pathogen or is suspected (see Section 5.1)."</seg>
<seg id="2688">The efficacy of retinapamulin in patients with infections caused by a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was insufficient.</seg>
<seg id="2689">An alternative therapy should be considered if no improvement or deterioration of the infected body occurs after a 2- or 3-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The effect of the simultaneous application of retinapamulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface has not been studied and the simultaneous application of other topical medicines is not recommended.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"due to the low plasma concentrations, which were achieved in humans after topical application on skewed skin or infected superficial wounds, clinically relevant inhibition in vivo is not expected (see Section 5.2)."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"3 After simultaneous oral administration of 2 times a day, 200 mg of ketoconazole increased the mean retapamulin AUC (0-24) and CMAx after topical application of 1% reapamulin ointment on skewed skin of healthy adult men by 81%."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients, dose adjustments are not considered necessary if topical retapamulin is applied during systemic treatment with CYP3A4 inhibitors."</seg>
<seg id="2694">Animal studies have shown a reproductive toxicity after oral consumption and are insufficient in terms of a statement on the birth and fetal / postnatal development (see Section 5.3).</seg>
<seg id="2695">Retapamulin ointment should only be applied during pregnancy if a topical antibacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the application of retinapamulin is preferable to the administration of a systemic antibiotic.</seg>
<seg id="2696">"when deciding whether breastfeeding should be continued / terminated or the treatment with Altargo should be continued / terminated, the benefit of breastfeeding is to be considered for the infant and the benefit of altargo therapy for the woman."</seg>

<seg id="2698">"retinapamulin is a semi-synthetic derivative of Pleuromutilin, a substance that is isolated from clitopilus passwort (previously Pleiurotus passwort) by fermentation."</seg>
<seg id="2699">The mode of action of retinapamulin is based on selective inhibition of bacterial protein synthesis by interaction at a specific binding site of the bacterial ribosome that differs from the binding points of other ribosomal interacting antibacterial substances.</seg>
<seg id="2700">Data indicate that the binding site ribosomales Protein L3 is involved and is located in the region of the ribosomal P-binding site and the peptide transfer facility.</seg>
<seg id="2701">"binding on this binding site inhibits the peptide transfer, partially blocking P-binding interactivity and prevents the normal formation of active ribosomal subunits."</seg>
<seg id="2702">"due to the local prevalence of resistance, the application of retinapamulin at least some infection forms may seem questionable, should seek advice by experts."</seg>
<seg id="2703">There were no differences in the in-vitro activity of retinapamulin compared to S.aureus regardless of whether the isolates were sensitive or resistant to methicillin.</seg>
<seg id="2704">"in the case of non-response to treatment with S.aureus, the presence of strains with additional virulence factors (such as PVL = Panton-Valentine Leucocidin) should be considered."</seg>

<seg id="2709">"metabolism The in vitro oxidative metabolism of retinapamulin in human liver microsoms was primarily mediated by CYP3A4, with less involvement of CYP2C8 and CYP2D6 (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="2710">"in studies on the oral toxicity of rats (50, 150 or 450 mg / kg) carried out over 14 days, there were indications of adaptive liver and thyroid changes."</seg>

<seg id="2723">Ambirix is used to protect hepatitis A and hepatitis B (diseases affecting the liver) in children aged between 1 and 15 who are not immune to these two diseases.</seg>
<seg id="2724">"Ambirix is used as a vaccination plan consisting of two doses, whereby a protection against hepatitis B may only be reached after the second dose is administered."</seg>
<seg id="2725">"for this reason, Ambirix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during immunization and ensures that the vaccination plan existing from two doses can be brought to an end."</seg>

<seg id="2728">"after a child has received the vaccine, the immune system detects viruses and surface antigens as" alien "and produces antibodies against it."</seg>
<seg id="2729">"Ambirix contains the same components as the Vaccine, which has been approved since 1996, and the vaccine approved since 1997."</seg>
<seg id="2730">"the three vaccines are used to protect against the same diseases, but Twinrix adults and Twinrix children are administered within the framework of a vaccination plan consisting of three doses."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"because Ambirix and Twinrix adults contain identical ingredients, some of the data that support the application of Twinrix adults were also used as evidence for the application of Ambirix."</seg>
<seg id="2732">The main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of vaccinated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration a month after the last injection.</seg>
<seg id="2733">"in an additional study involving 208 children, the efficacy of the vaccine was compared to a six-month period and a 12-month interval between the two injections."</seg>
<seg id="2734">Ambirix conducted a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibodies against hepatitis A and B between 98 and 100% of vaccinated children.</seg>
<seg id="2735">The additional study showed that Ambirix's degree of protection was similar in a six-month period and a 12-month interval between the injections.</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the most common adverse events of Ambirix (observed in over 1 of 10 vaccine doses) are headache, loss of appetite, pain at the injection point, redness, fatigue (fatigue) as well as irritability."</seg>

<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dose of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamyl phosphate synthetase or ornithreadscarcanylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with an argininosuccinatase deficiency must obtain arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">"AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with swallowing disorders, as there is a risk for the formation of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach."</seg>
<seg id="2821">"each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, according to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose."</seg>

<seg id="2965">"Apidra is used for the treatment of adults, adolescents and children from six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneously (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, the thighs or the upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin to regulate the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or that insulin can not be processed effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very little from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has shorter active life than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was studied in the application in combination with a long-lasting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"for type 2 diabetes, where the body is unable to use insulin effectively, Apidra was studied in a study involving 878 adults."</seg>
<seg id="2971">The main indicator of efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in the blood which indicates how well the blood sugar is set.</seg>
<seg id="2972">In the first study with adults with type 1 diabetes a reduction of 0.14% (from 7.60% to 7.46%) was observed compared to a reduction of 0.14% in insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2973">In adults with type 2 diabetes the decrease of HbA1c concentration was 0.46% after six months with Apidra compared to 0.30% in human normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2974">Apidra may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive to insulin or any of the other ingredients or in patients who are already suffering from hypoglycemia.</seg>
<seg id="2975">The doses of Apidra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines that can affect blood glucose levels.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"in September 2004, the European Commission granted approval to the company Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH for the marketing of Apidra throughout the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"as a subcutaneous injection, Apidra can be applied either in the area of the abdominal wall, the thighs or the delta muscle or to apply subcutaneously through continuous infusion in the area of the abdominal wall."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"due to the reduced glucose capacity and the reduced insulin metabolism, the need for insulin can be reduced in patients with a limitation of the liver function."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"any change of effectiveness, the brand (creator), the insulin type (normal, NPH, zinklag etc.), the type of insulin (animal insulin) and / or the production method can pull a change in the insulin demand."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"3 An insufficient dosage or abortion of a treatment, in particular in patients with insulin-based diabetes, can lead to hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis. these conditions are potentially life-threatening."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"the conversion of a patient to another insulin type, or an insulin produced by another manufacturer, should take place under strict medical supervision and can make a change in the dosage necessary."</seg>
<seg id="2982">The time of occurrence of hypoglycemia depends on the operating profile of the used insulin and can therefore be changed when changing the treatment scheme.</seg>
<seg id="2983">"the substances that increase blood sugar reduction activity and increase the inclination to hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetics, angiotensin-Converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, Disopyramid, Fibrate, Fluoxetine, Propoxyyl, Salizylate and sulfonamide antibiotics."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"in addition, symptoms of adrenergic counter-regulation can be weakened or absent under the effect of sympathetic disorders such as beta blockers, Clonidin, Guanethidin and Reserpin."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"experimental studies on reproductive toxicity showed no differences between insu- linglulisin and human insulin in terms of pregnancy, embryonic / fetal development, birth or postnatal development (see Section 5.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"it is not known whether insulin stimulates the human breast milk, but in general insulin is not absorbed into breast milk, nor is it resorbed after oral application."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"listed below are listed in clinical studies, grouped by system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence (very common: ≥ 1 / 100, &lt; 1 / 100; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000; very rare: &lt; 1 / 10,000)."</seg>

<seg id="2989">"Lipodystrophy Wird fails to change the injection area within the injection area, can result in a lipodystrophy at the injection site."</seg>
<seg id="2990">Severe hypoglycaemia with unconsciousness can be treated with an intramuscular or subcutaneous injection of glucose (0.5 to 1 mg) administered by an appropriately trained person or treated with intravenous glucose by a doctor.</seg>
<seg id="2991">"following a glucose injection, the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypoglycemia and to avoid similar episodes."</seg>
<seg id="2992">Insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral glucose intake (in particular through skeletal musculature and fat) as well as by inhibiting glucose production in the liver.</seg>
<seg id="2993">Studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that a subcutaneous ga- be of insulin receptors takes place faster and the active duration is shorter than with hu- manem normal insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2994">"in a study of 18 male people aged 21 to 50 with type 1 diabetes, insulin doses of 0,075 to 0,15 E / kg showed a proportional amount of glucosal effect, and 0.3 E / kg or more a low-proportional increase in the glucosal effect, just like human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="2995">Insulin lulisin has a twice as fast effect as normal human insulin and achieves the complete glucosal effect of approximately 2 hours earlier than human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2996">"the data showed that in an application of insulin lulisin 2 minutes before the meal, a comparable postprandial glycaemic control is reached like with a human normal insulin, which is given 30 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for 2 minutes before the meal, insulin luliswas obtained in 2 minutes before the meal, and a better postoperative control than with the human normal insulin, which was given 2 minutes before the meal."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"if insulin doses are applied in 15 minutes after the start of the meal, a comparable glycaemic control such as the humanized normal insulin, which is given 2 mi- nuds before the meal (see Figure 1), is achieved."</seg>
