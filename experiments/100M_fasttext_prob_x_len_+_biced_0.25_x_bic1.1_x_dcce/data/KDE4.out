&quot; if a part of the text is selected , only this part will be translated into place of the entire &amp; URL . &quot;
&quot; in the best case , bab@@ el@@ fish produces a gross translation and in the worst case non@@ sense . therefore , no important decisions should be made dependent on the translations without checking the translation beforehand . &quot;
only websites on the Internet can be translated . other texts should be translated on the Bab@@ el@@ fish page itself where you can insert translated texts directly .
&quot; package &amp; package ; contains various modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . despite its small size , they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making it easier to use . &quot;
more information about using &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select settings extensions ... Open the card card tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that any more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , which contains &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , before comp@@ iling this package . &quot;
&quot; to use the crash module , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; on Tools Canc@@ el . then you can view the page that has brought &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or the list of crashes , if any , delete . &quot;
you can reach the module view filter ( also called Fol@@ der Filter ) in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar under Extras Application Filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; it can filter the current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use the DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default the display begins with the root node of the document , example : document@@ element , all other no@@ des are sub @-@ elements of this root node . &quot;
the &amp; FS@@ View module ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; provides a wider view of objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative to the different symbol and text views to view the contents of your local file system .
&quot; tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle , whose surface is proportional to its size . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or folder , the size of a folder than the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily detected even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , it can be viewed as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX command . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap representation is a rect@@ angle representing a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . for easier navigation , the rec@@ tan@@ gles have meaningful color and labelling settings . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the illustration of another file property like name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each property , you can specify whether it is displayed at all , only if there is enough space for representation or if the area of subordin@@ ate rec@@ tan@@ gles is to be used ( whereby , therefore , you can set the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle ) . &quot;
&quot; for Tre@@ em@@ aps the rule should be observed that the area is proportional to the size of the entry . with the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal will not always be observed . &quot;
&quot; how to split the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . in this case , it is necessary for lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses due to frames always beneficial to divide surfaces that are as square as possible . the best methods in this regard are lines , columns or recur@@ sive branches . &quot;
&quot; you can specify the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry using the menu entry View on area . instead , a diamond pattern is drawn into the area of the parent entry to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; original was &amp; FS@@ View ; as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map Wid@@ gets , which was developed for the K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application . &quot;
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Picture Gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens with which you can specify the image of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to customize the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .

&quot; using the comment file check box , you can specify a comment file for the cap@@ tion of the images in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the check box , you can specify a different color depth for the thumb@@ nails than in the original images . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings allows you to easily access the general &amp; HTML ; settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; Settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML Settings . the following behaviour of the web browser can be specified here :

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; working together . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; includes a fast image processing with basic picture editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ cam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 @-@ bit color space and all available modules support the crude conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with much more metadata , such as &amp; eg ; over the camera or lens , which can be searched for . &quot;
like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs is also &amp; digi@@ kam ; an open source project . that means it depends on the support of end users . you should therefore report problems and improvement options .
&quot; whenever you are in the program , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . if you are using this link , your web browser will open a page in the error reporting system . &quot;
&quot; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ cam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ cam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ cam ; if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ cam ; are , then we would like to answer you questions to other users of &amp; digi@@ kam ; however , in this mailing list is spoken English , you should therefore be powerful . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ cam ; homepage to find news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ kam ; to learn .
the best start to join &amp; digi@@ kam ; to participate is registration in the developer mailing list . instructions for reporting in the developer mailing list of &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; when you start &amp; digi@@ cam ; for the first time , you will be asked where you want to save your pictures and your database . you can specify a local , remote or removable folder . simply enter the path name , or click the Fol@@ der icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you need to specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data ab@@ n@@ k will be saved . this path stays the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you would like to add . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will also use as an Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard drive , you can specify the top@@ most folder that contains images as the base folder . &amp; digi@@ kam ; viewed each sub@@ folder as an album . no picture will be changed . during browsing the folder you get a progress indicator like this : &quot;
&amp; digi@@ kam ; dur@@ ess recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub @-@ folders unless it is i@@ ste in hidden folder . this lets you insert a point in front of the name of the sub@@ folder .
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folders , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ kl@@ ist don &apos;t have any photos as symbols . you can change them by taking any photo from the album and taking this on the folder icon . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up your digital camera . after that you should learn how to use My Albums and My keywords to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; raw file support : if you use the raw mode of your camera , it can work . support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Menu Help menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in sections Ro@@ h @-@ Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; more than 1000 digital cameras are supported by the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , every medium and card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam ; working together . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; memory cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer .
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses the g@@ Photo@@ 2 program to communicate with digital cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a common protocol developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripher@@ als without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
&quot; many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos generally are large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow , this connection is outdated . &quot;
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support so that the thumb@@ nails can be read reliably by digi@@ K@@ am . if the ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to see thumb@@ nails or the generation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things in &amp; digi@@ cam ; is how easy its functionality can be extended by modules :
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE Image plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common modular structure for &amp; digi@@ kam , K@@ Photo@@ Album , Sho@@ vi@@ mg and G@@ wen@@ view . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphic programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section . &quot;
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as it can also be a user . their advantage is that it is much easier to add &amp; digi@@ kam ; by writing a small module to add a function than the changes in &amp; digi@@ kam ; even perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; remove or switch to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images works anywhere : you can place a picture in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ edi@@ n , over the horizontal divi@@ der line or in another application window . the only limitation is that you can not disc@@ ard one image in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; - a file type selection allows you to highlight the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is only used for the fields that are currently displayed in the symbol view . thus , the filter works on the fil@@ en@@ ame only if it is displayed in the symbol view . what fields are displayed can be configured in the dialog of the default settings . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; provides an organized view on your photo albums . all photos stored by &amp; digi@@ cam can be stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted by the folder where they were created on the hard drive , or after the date the album was created . &quot;
&quot; if you have set up a scanner , you can scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan a photo directly to an album . you can also add a screen@@ shot straight to an album . choose Album Import screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move a picture from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it there . in the then appearing menu , you have to select whether the image is moved by moving or copying . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and edit album features in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name . the collection you set will be used to sort your photos , if you want to add or delete new collections by collection . if you want to add or delete new collections , you can do this in the settings for collections . &quot;
the album date : is used when you sort your albums by date with view albums by sorting date .
&quot; buttons El@@ ders , average , New Year : these set the date on the oldest , the newest picture or the section of the album . this will first attempt to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of last change of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first select an album in &amp; digi@@ cam ; open , the first picture in the album is selected as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this should help you to remember the photos on the album . sometimes , the first photo on the album is not representative and you may want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select &quot; &quot; Set as album preview &quot; &quot; in the pop @-@ up menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can only be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
this collection includes all photos of the album . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window will provide you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures will be displayed in this album in the picture window . each picture will be shown in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two lou@@ pe buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait a short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided by using Extras all thumb@@ nails in the Extras menu . &quot;
&quot; information on each image is displayed below the corresponding preview . what information this is , you can edit it . select the Albums page and customize the preview images to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails have help window that appears . if you let the mouse @-@ hand rest a moment over a picture . the help shows the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the Intro@@ duction to the main window shows one such help window .
&quot; albums and keywords allow you to organize your photos as it fits you . image editing displays your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to this . you can choose all the functions that are available with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can choose between viewing the pictures , a slide show or editing the pictures . &quot;
you can open the picture editing with a photo by either editing F@@ 4 image ... or selecting the contex@@ tual menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... Select a guide how to edit your photos . with image editing you can view and change your photos .
&quot; it may happen that &amp; digi@@ kam ; the functionality you need is not available . you can open a photo in another program by selecting the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the File Type sub@@ menu . &quot;
&quot; some programs do not store these data when you save the changed image . therefore , this information is lost from the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest is to click the right mouse button on the preview and rotate . in the sub @-@ menu , you can specify the degree of rotation . &quot;
&quot; to change the file name of a photo , right click the Pre@@ view button and select F@@ 2 Ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you will retain the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo ; delete it , it will be moved to the garbage dump of &amp; k@@ de ; Del@@ ete . F@@ 8 Picture Del@@ ete or Del If you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; the View &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ me quot ; organizes your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ kam ; use either the EX@@ IF date , or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be displayed in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date page at the bottom of the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days can be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags are sti@@ ckers that can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or a search . &quot;
&quot; when a keyword is selected , all photos marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tags can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . hereby you can organize your keywords lo@@ gically . you can also find parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword list , so that you can easily find the keywords you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG , so you can also use your keywords in other programs . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by clicking with the right mouse button either at &quot; &quot; My keyword &quot; &quot; or on an existing keyword and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked a new keyword after you click an existing keyword , this will be the sub@@ stit@@ ch@@ word of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; you can delete a keyword by clicking on the keyword with the right mouse button and selecting Del@@ ete . if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword , drag it to the desired position in the tree and put it there . then a menu appears that gives you the possibility to post@@ p@@ one the keyword . a keyword can only be in the tree at a time . &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by right @-@ clicking it and edit the keyword in the keyword . you can change the name of the keyword and the icon in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you need to click the picture with the right mouse button and select Run as an album preview in the context menu . additionally , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : once you have selected the photos you want to add with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword . alternatively , you can click on the right mouse button on the preview of the pictures and select keywords from the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; you can indicate a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you choose one of the keywords assigned to him . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was made , one for the event it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keyword , this will be displayed under the preview of the image in the main window . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword in which you open the context menu of the photo with the right mouse button , and select from the keywords menu Rem@@ ove . the menu will show you only the keywords assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline view shows a time @-@ dependent , adjustable hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be cli@@ cked through this hist@@ ogram . to select a time@@ frame , you only need to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame which displays the time unit . this will display all the associated pictures in the main window . &quot;
&quot; in the field below , you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below . &quot;
&quot; include all the elements of the database : names , reviews , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more . &quot;
&quot; when you click on this , the filtering will be deleted and all images are displayed again . if the search has not found anything , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you can save a simple search box as described above . &quot;
&quot; if you are satisfied with your selection , hit the header OK and search will be performed . the results will be displayed in My Search List in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching again , you only need to select the corresponding entry from the View My search list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you select to edit search , the form to enter the search will appear again with the search information entered in . if you select as advanced search , the dialog will appear for the advanced search to change your previous search . here you can find more rules for searching . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select &quot; &quot; Del@@ ete &quot; &quot; in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides an extended search form with many search parameters , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ cam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . all rules are displayed in line by operators , sorted by operators . each option can be added with other information about logical operations All ... , A ... , No ... or At least ... you can create search of type &amp; quot ; AND NI@@ CH@@ T@@ quot ; . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; character@@ izes each image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two picture signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar one . if you move a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ accurate search in the left side@@ bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : open @-@ hand colour sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and digi@@ cam ; find the matching pictures . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom in with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will then be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; provides a lighting table in a separate window with which you can easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em Li@@ gh@@ tly from the contex@@ tual menu . the selection is added to the lumin@@ aire and open its window . if you are back in &amp; digi@@ cam ; main window , you can quickly open the lumin@@ aire with L Extras lumin@@ aire . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nail allows you to drag and drop the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window . a small arrow shows you which copy in which window area is to be seen . if you want to preview the preview from the tool@@ bar and perform zo@@ oming operations on one of the images , then you can compare the same area of the two images . &quot;
&quot; another mode is better suited to quickly select from a series of images . if you use combination mode from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the areas for compar@@ isons . use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to display it in the right pane . this simpli@@ fies it through a series of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal sol@@ der actions work directly from the LED like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both thumb@@ nails in the light table . this makes it easy to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . to swing the visible area of the image , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB . in the preview mode both pictures will show the same image area . &quot;
just use the zoom slider under the images or C@@ trl ; scroll wheel to zoom into the image and zoom out . this happens in both images if you are in the preview mode .
&quot; digital stock management considers every part of the process that follows after the image has been taken to final output and permanent storage . each of the photos receives , scans or digital photos stores a form of digital inventory management . most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect , and use photos . we look at the procedures for digital photographers that use &amp; digi@@ cam ; use . we look at the download , ren@@ ame , remove , convert , record , archive , review , wait and export image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management takes up , inde@@ xed , categ@@ orized , sec@@ ures , searches , transformed , conf@@ ec@@ tioned and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value . quot ; &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is defined in accordance with your definition data that provides information about or documentation of other data that are administered by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then use definitely not &amp; digi@@ cam ; . the approach to store metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast searches and secure archiving that you can access with other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you incorporate something into your system is the structure of information structure unlike the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive , etc ; make sure you have to switch to a larger drive at some point . &quot;
&quot; maybe you will be happy with this structure . holiday pictures can be quickly found on your location . the remaining photos will be organized by your date . if you make enough photos , you will be able to use sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements such as version@@ ing of photos , archiving , work sequences , constant supply of images to different themes and a large number of everything . within 10 years 95 % of archives and 5 % work files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? the separation of file types makes the batch processing easier . separate new files from old files .
the separation of original and work files simpli@@ fies a backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative picture .
&quot; we also recommend storing the metadata in the Settings page of the metadata in &amp; digi@@ kam ; to enable it to be added to the file . if you forget this , you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the relevant item in the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what happens if you want to change it ? added &amp; digi@@ cam ; they provide a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important ones . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can select all the images that require the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense , because you can focus on the best photos in the next work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s continue with keywords , keywords , as you frequently call other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; if you import catalogues from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or insert the images in the right place . the sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is not a problem and can easily be done by dra@@ gging a sub @-@ tree to another . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different metadata is over@@ lap . this is a very rough representation , since each block of metadata consists of many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; most people just want to let you see your photos , you want to share them with your friends , your family , other photographers and agencies . you are sure to be interested in how your photos arrive . &quot;
&quot; from the distance there is not even a nice beach panorama . if you look closer , then catch some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; wow ! you begin to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period is present again , you may even hear the silence . so the lab@@ eling has changed your perception of this panorama completely . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures you should tell a story . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only with an inscription for itself to work alone .
&quot; with &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can save as much text as you want in an internation@@ alized alpha@@ bet ( UT@@ F @-@ 8 ) , as well . you can even export it for a selection of images at the same time . &quot;
do you remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find another city without navigation system ? was it not a boring planet before Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well because with pictures the train of spatial presentation now drives with light speed .
&quot; the possibilities of using ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become even deeper in the future . I &apos;m sure one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your trips by using images with geographic data . this then shows the photos at the location . you can also export the pictures to G@@ aller@@ y@@ 2 , Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web , Fli@@ ck@@ r &amp; etc ; with the Goo@@ gle@@ Maps Viewer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and den@@ otes the practice of using copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and modification of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ cam ; as information should be stored :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo . if it is not desired to use the name of the photographer , e.g. to protect the identity of the photographer , then the name of a company or organization can be used . this field does not support comm@@ as or sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ ons as separ@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; author &apos;s title : associated with the author . this field contains the working description of the photographer . examples of this can be titles such as : employee photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . &quot;
&quot; publisher ( syn@@ onym for provider ) : use the provider field to identify who works the photo . this does not necessarily have to be the author . if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not offer protection against mis@@ use . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or modify this data embedded in the image . for individuals , this is very important for the majority of your photos . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per image . &amp; digi@@ kam ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : disk failures , disk failure , electric sho@@ cks , EC@@ C , transmission errors , ageing of the storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , disaster prevention , lifetime , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tions &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that have been lost on the street or fire . this sort of loss is the same which can also happen with traditional paper photographs or neg@@ atives . in this section , it &apos;s about problems with the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; K@@ roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers about gold coated DVDs , &amp; dollar ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years . whether you believe it lies in your discretion . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD disks can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest , but you write a lot more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control h@@ um . despite this massive protection they age through chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a cheap program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that apparently works wonders on CDs and DVDs . it runs on Windows and Linux ; it is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read damaged disks , hard drives , flash media , USB drives , etc . &quot;
optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against HD DVD . a Dual @-@ layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a Dual @-@ layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs is of course also valid for the Blu @-@ ray disc .
&quot; burn slowly with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . after that , read the data again to check you . likewise , you should copy the media with a description , date &amp; author and then copy the data to the next generation of media before you read the last piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; disk manufacturers keep your statistics for themselves . their manufacturer guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives : &quot;
&quot; electronic parts of the controller are the most common error cause , S@@ MA@@ RT cannot detect these errors . some of S@@ MA@@ RT errors are the most common error cause . some of S@@ MA@@ RT errors are the most frequent cause of failure . the expected lifetime is between 4 and 5 years . &quot;
&quot; of course you can also recover data loss due to a power failure before you secured the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electrical devices don &apos;t make much electricity , it looks different for devices with computer chips and high @-@ speed processes . these can cause severe damage . so , these anom@@ ali@@ es can cause serious damage , hardware aging , destroyed mother@@ boards and other defects . protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most common protection against spi@@ kes is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absor@@ bs a part of the energy slots and ends the rest . it is usually available in the form of a connector bar . remember , however , that not every connector bar also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should make sure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; as an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should make sure that all peripheral devices that are connected to your system are also protected . some manufacturers provide over@@ voltage sho@@ cks which also provide a telephone connection for your modem . others offer connectivity options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially designed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem . &quot;
&quot; while an over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . it can therefore be useful to invest in un@@ interrup@@ tible power supply . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protecting against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power ou@@ tage occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run the system in order . if you buy a U@@ PS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as over@@ voltage protection . furthermore , the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk that your computer system is exposed to and compare its security with the costs to avoid this . a high @-@ quality over@@ voltage protection can you get up to &amp; euro ; 20 costs , A 500@@ W US@@ V can be used for less than &amp; euro ; 40 . &quot;
&quot; Amazon Web service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . &quot;
&quot; however , they are very expensive compared to the hard drives at home - 40 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB cost &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you need to send the data over the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . it is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the Photo Community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are available on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to have your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are adjusted automatically thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies contain a backup and distributed memory . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transm@@ issions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the file system Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing about it is that nobody says you when a transmission error occurred , not when it happened in your hardware . all these disturbances remain un@@ discovered until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise . no one seems to have ever thought of it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , since they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . for normal fil@@ es@@ ystems these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems , you should look into the future . in 2010 you will see thousands of mistakes each year . &quot;
&quot; it is open source , with many patents and is available under a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon also be available for Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ lower fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha status . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS is used and is also available for &amp; Linux ; it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss in the not@@ ebook and 46 % for work@@ station systems .
data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to a lesser damage such as theft or new installations . and it is currently limited to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; nobody has been si@@ ghted for a long time .
&quot; open source fil@@ es@@ ystems are less vulnerable to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the most common fil@@ es@@ ystems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling file systems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the investigation process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem occurred , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : false , theft and human error are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
sensors of digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 lens settings of fundamental physical limits . this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras go towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the end result rather deterior@@ ates . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have their limit at 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . for higher resolutions you need a full @-@ format sensor ( 24@@ x@@ 36@@ mm ) or larger formats .
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; therefore , make no one responsible for data loss . so , make sure your data is affected by data loss every year . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive every day . if , then one day , a lightning strikes you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; therefore , disaster prevention is always a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as already said above , there is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be backed up . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential lock : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . generates a complete snapshot of two time points : the complete assurance and the last differential lock .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . produces multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time when such backup is made . this backup comes with an exemp@@ tion system closest to the exception that it is only scann@@ ed and not continuous .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts r@@ sync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed . this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
secure important images directly after you have saved them on your computer onto a DVD or another optical medium .
&quot; in the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . &quot;
&quot; themes : metadata , stored in the image file , retained IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , retained original , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eval of images and metadata , copying images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is approximately the period in which you are really interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you must consider all that is said today with caution and re @-@ evaluate it as time goes by . unfortunately , there is no other way to make a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . the less variants you have used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone today . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the Council is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , your memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have set the scal@@ ability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition . at * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it on a new disk :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new disk has been recognized by the system , but don &apos;t hang it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c &amp; dollar ; par@@ ted / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; par@@ ted / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; par@@ ted / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; par@@ ted res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 # change the size of disk if necessary &quot;
&quot; open source standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if one day there is no software that can be read , then you can create it yourself . this task becomes easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary , patented format that slowly disappears from the market . therefore , you should not use it any more . &quot;
&quot; it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG can store gam@@ ma@@ - and chro@@ mati@@ city data for improved color assignment at hetero@@ geneous platforms . the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and has a slow compression . &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with loss @-@ free compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images of high quality but requires very large files .
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open blank format that was developed by Adobe Systems . D@@ NG is developed on the basis of the need to standardi@@ se camera cap@@ tions . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to use metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers are already at your disposal and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it at some point .
&quot; this is possibly one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe has introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; image resource block &quot; technology of the n@@ ine@@ ties . X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer an original of your recording , mostly in raw format , to archive . X@@ MP fits as it stores metadata separately from the image file . however , you should consider if you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI activities include workshops , discussions and collaborative work in the D@@ C@@ MI communities and D@@ C@@ MI working groups , annual conferences and workshops , standard links and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import pictures from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the pictures are on the camera folder , you can use it as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save it to your raw archive . this function has not been implemented yet .
&quot; for a fine @-@ lay@@ ered editing you can use external programs . if you edit the images again with &amp; digi@@ cam ; edit , then you should add the metadata again . these were under certain circumstances trun@@ cated from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed images for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . export them into web galleries , code in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; digi@@ cam ; to get . in the addition of a photo to an album , you will find a description of how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect these to the computer , turn the camera on the display mode and turn it on . see the manual of your camera for more description . &quot;
&quot; if you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . if the connection is made , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera are displayed . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file allocation for each file , photos , movies , music etc. are displayed on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before you download the photos on your computer , you may need the camera information for each entry . with the side bars properties and metadata from the camera interface , you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and photo information that is internally stored by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not been downloaded to your computer . note that some digital cameras do not have all the information available .
&quot; the tab Met@@ adata displays the internal metadata such as Ex@@ if , manufacturer remark , GPS , etc. of the image . this information is the same as for the metadata page bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam ; or image processing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the easiest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All . this loads all photos from your camera into a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; .
&quot; if you do not want to download all the photos , you can select only the desired selection methods from &amp; k@@ de ; once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download the selected button . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option &quot; &quot; New &quot; &quot; is available . in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you select this option , only the new pictures will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; if you want to download all the buttons , select a dialog with which you can select the target album in which the photos will be selected . the list of existing albums will be shown in the My Albums tab . &quot;
&quot; after you selected the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ cam ; loads the photos from the camera into the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the photos you have downloaded , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at once by selecting the Del@@ ete Clear All . if you only want to delete a few , you must select them first and then delete selected delete sel@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore the photos you have deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully downloaded into a digi@@ cam ; so you should carefully check if you want to remove them from the camera . if you want to completely delete the camera , you should do so on the camera , as this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; the file names are usually re @-@ used after the photos have been deleted from the camera . this can lead to dup@@ licate file names , if you load photos of different recording sets into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the image has been made into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section , you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for database @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , you will automatically create a folder per day . &quot;
&quot; the options Dur@@ ing the transfer will open three more options that are performed before the photos are stored on the disk . if you select this , the corresponding entries will be copied from the ex@@ if information into the IP@@ TC fields . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % m@@ - % d % H : % M in the editing field . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the camera fil@@ en@@ ame option , you have the option to modify the file names in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case , if you prefer this . &quot;
&quot; the new file name , the digi@@ cam ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you open the camera window next time . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point recording to perform automatic rotation during download . not all cameras provide this information . in the Met@@ adata section , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; automatic rotation is normally turned on , and if your camera doesn &apos;t deliver this information , the photo in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic rotation , use the Advanced button and select the automatic rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; if your camera provides information about the date the photo was made available , you can use this to automatically download sub @-@ albums in the target album . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . &quot;
&quot; this option is normally turned off , and in this case it saves &amp; digi@@ cam ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , use the Advanced button and select the Date @-@ based Sub@@ al@@ ds at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to load photos from your computer to your camera is the button download . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , asks &amp; digi@@ cam ; you know where the pictures should be uploaded . a folder selection dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and click OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means that a position indicated in length and width graphs and which can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers , it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses a plane to car@@ to@@ graphic an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architectural offices and real estate agents can use this ability . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot about where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that shows the area . if you want to send a postcard to another &amp; digi@@ cam ; users who want to locate the location of the photo , or just want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how to get the GPS data in the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 many GPS data fields , such as direction , sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ings and card references . the question is actually more than the data in these fields ? there are at least three ways to achieve this . directly with the right hardware , about a post @-@ processing of the GPS data and image files with the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographical mapping ( manual ) and finally via manual entry of well @-@ known locations . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that integrates a GPS unit . but there are a few working with GPS receivers . either as a card module or by transmission of data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ d or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel , but you need to save that data in GP@@ X format , as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ mapping module . &quot;
&quot; there are different programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS , which can extract and cor@@ relate the data of images and GPS . on the following page , you can download the same under &amp; Linux ; &quot;
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ Tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the characters ha@@ iry coordinates created for example by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show European road maps . here are some European sites , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; tries to give you so much control over your work processes as possible . there are many settings that modify the behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; to access these settings , you need to edit the Settings menu . you can switch between these by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
select Action can be set on embedded preview or image editing can be set . you set the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ cam ; determine if you click on an entry in the main view .

the IP@@ TC actions store the data into the corresponding IP@@ TC field@@ bus . this results in the fact that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the databases of &amp; digi@@ kam ; these metadata are also available to other programs and can be imported into &amp; digi@@ kam ; imported without being lost .
&quot; save image ann@@ ot@@ ations as embedded cap@@ tions ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , with the cap@@ tions embedded in the images . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appears when the mouse cursor rests in the main window over a file . depending on the chosen option , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; &amp; # 160 ; digi@@ kam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ kam ; attempted , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
you can reset the default settings by pressing the Update button to the right of each category .
&quot; each time you open the illuminated table , these settings are switched on if possible . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , you can get better viewing results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use the image processing in full screen mode . &quot;
over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image . these colors are set here . in image processing this view mode can be switched on and off with F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 .
&quot; with Chro@@ ma @-@ Sub@@ sampling , it is meant that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for closer explanation . &quot;
&quot; with the P@@ NG compression setting , you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce the image quality because P@@ NG requires a loss @-@ free algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the TI@@ FF files , you can switch the de@@ late compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of TI@@ FF images . it does not affect image quality since the default algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; you can save los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files with los@@ s@@ less JPEG 2000 files . even if you select the los@@ sy settings , the relationship between loss of quality and file size is far better than the normal JPEG . as this paragraph is written , metadata has not yet been supported but was in the planning phase . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . currently , it is fast becoming a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the image processing settings . &quot;
&quot; the default is that all green pixels are the same . if the straight green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels on odd lines , this difference produces a mesh pattern in the output . this option draws the image slightly soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic ink balance is used . &quot;
this setting is only used if the white balance is not set . standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight .
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect that under@@ exposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the top lights , so the parts of your images that are burned with , due to the inability of your camera to catch the top lights as penet@@ rating white . use the setting of continuous white in the settings . the setting colors trigger some unusual results as it shows the pointed @-@ lights in various Ros@@ at@@ ö@@ nen . finally , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of the missing information from the top lights . &quot;
this is possible because blue pixels generally do not satur@@ ate as fast as green and red . &amp; digi@@ kam ; and d@@ cra@@ p therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red portions of the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course this is a question of how much color or white you want .
&quot; if you select the option re@@ construct , you get the possibility to set a level . here , a value of three is a compromise and can / should be adjusted individually for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can also be done later in the editing options of the digi@@ cam ; image editing . to keep the time for the demo icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor , which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of colored pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color design . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ f provide three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it looks as if A@@ HD @-@ Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ic Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ f . it creates colour art@@ ef@@ acts on the edges . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue correction values here . this is certainly the best method for a color change correction , as it is carried out during crude conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions on how to return it . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information like color information from a color space to translate into the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
ask behavior Ques@@ tions when an image is opened in the image processing / color management module with raw files .
&quot; color Profile Fol@@ der Set the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles You have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed later when opening the raw file .
&quot; the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here , only your images are color @-@ managed not the entire screen . &quot;
&quot; the input profiles should fit the camera manufacturer and model you are using . not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , for example Canon which does not contain color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ b G@@ amma does not correct for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you have to perform the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options like the Soft @-@ Pro@@ of @-@ Profile , which you can em@@ ulate as your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print a picture , because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore be very saturated . this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras it is quite obvious which color profile is provided for what is intended for . unfortunately , not with the models of Canon . therefore here is a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is naturally in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension leaves the style for the goal : F for a precise style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . it is an interface supported by a series of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image processing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ cam ; many modules that were written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has the K@@ IP@@ I modules installed , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use , and these will be uploaded by &amp; digi@@ cam ; these modules appear as new entries in the main window menu and in addition , you will find some also in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings short commands .
further information ( in English ) via K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the settings of the slide show should be easy to understand . the upper regulator adju@@ sts the time between the picture transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds are good . &quot;
&quot; the camera properties show on the left side a list of all the currently supported cameras . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which tries to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . if you want to use this , make sure the camera is properly connected , turned on and in image mode . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom end , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . this field is only active if you have selected a USB or Fire@@ Wire mass storage camera from the camera list . you have to specify the path , / m@@ nt / camera or / m@@ nt / Rem@@ ov@@ able , on which you mount your camera . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , place it in the display mode and turn it on . &quot;
&quot; check out if &amp; digi@@ kam ; the camera automatically detects . if not , you can manually set camera models and port . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . it is displayed in the menu cameras of the main window . if you own more than one camera , you can insert all of them here . &quot;
&quot; with the option confirmation dialog for moving the images in the bin , you can set the dialog by &amp; digi@@ cam ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album . in the sections Del@@ ete a photo and delete an album you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; editorial changes through the right side bar can be tac@@ itly set by &amp; digi@@ cam ; applied , if you use the option changes in the right side bar without resor@@ ting to . otherwise , you will need to save the changes with the button changes . &quot;
you can also display the display screen of &amp; digi@@ cam ; to prevent starting . this speeds up the start @-@ up of &amp; digi@@ cam ; .
&quot; setting Bei@@ m start looking for new photos creates &amp; digi@@ kam ; search the base folder for new or deleted albums / photos ; this length@@ ens the start time of &amp; digi@@ kam ; if something was deleted from the base folder , asks &amp; digi@@ cam ; you know if it should delete it from the database . &quot;
various color schemes can be used in &amp; digi@@ kam ; used to customize the main window to your taste . these settings can be selected from the tool@@ bar settings from the tool@@ bar settings . a preview of the available designs will be listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ cam ; to create , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; includes a fast image processing with some base tools . you can use them to view your photos and to preview and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of a picture or by selecting the entry / editing entry .
the image editing includes a set of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ cam ; so you may not be part of your distribution .
&quot; a status bar at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fying factor and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar on the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most frequently required functions .
&quot; editing functions of the image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using Save or Save the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can &apos;t recover the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
&quot; so you should make a copy of your image before you change it , so you can save it as a file . &quot;
&quot; as long as you have not saved your photo , you can restore the original image by using the File Rest@@ ore button or button Rec@@ re@@ producing the image processing in the tool@@ bar . you will then lose any change you have done on the photo since last saving . &quot;
&quot; virtually any action of the image editing can be revers@@ ed or restored . the last action can be revers@@ ed , by selecting Edit Ref@@ res@@ h or Rest@@ ore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should use the keyboard short@@ cut , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo , and C@@ trl ; Shift Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you select the &amp; L@@ MB ; pressing the button or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be revers@@ ed or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos in the same album or the same keyword , using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , picture high , down picture or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save them . &quot;
you can zoom into the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or the icons in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the view menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select magni@@ fying factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full Screen mode displays the picture in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c button . if you do not want this , you can change it in the editing dialog by &amp; digi@@ cam ; you can view it in the editing dialog by editing the main window . see the section to set up the image processing . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print the image in the File Picture and get the default &amp; k@@ de ; print dialog . you can customize the settings here before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu , you can print single images or whole sets . whole picture templates can be selected from your selection . you only need to select the images with the standard methods and select from the Album Ex@@ porting Wiz@@ ard . if you follow the wizard , you just need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; this &amp; digi@@ cam ; main window has a side bar at the right edge which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side bar is available without the navigation arrows , even in image processing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicks on the same tab let the side@@ bar appear or disappear back into the edge .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF@@ - and IP@@ TC fields so that you can be used by other programs .
IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are trun@@ cated after 2000 characters and special characters are changed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC labelling field in other applications you should consider these restrictions .
&quot; after you have commented on it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the user button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done if you chose a metadata setting that is always written into the images . &quot;
&quot; the review section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be used either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side bar or with the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to evaluate multiple images at the same time , select it and use the context menu . &quot;
the evaluation is written to the IP@@ TC field . the code follows the scheme in the following table :
&quot; the keyword @-@ view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword @-@ tree and a selection box with the keywords used previously in this &amp; digi@@ cam ; session . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the input keyword . you can quickly limit the number of possibilities when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom end is a further simpli@@ fication when entering keywords for a picture series . if you have typ@@ ed several keywords , they are stored for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by selecting the appropriate check@@ boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored in the keyword in the IP@@ TC field .
&quot; if multiple images are selected in the main view and you select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the keyword filter section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images displayed in the main window . usually , the left side bar is used with their album , - Date , keyword and view@@ points . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop keywords . suppose you have selected several images in the main view , so you can simply pull it out of the right side bar and put it on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window shows the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is on no keywords , which reduces the amount to three images . they were selected with C@@ trl + a , and after that a keyword was drawn from the right keyword @-@ tree to the selection and placed there . a dialog asks whether this keyword should be set . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be disabled in settings Mis@@ cell@@ aneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and realize that it should be one or more , you can change this easily by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the record you are looking for in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , picture , keyword , etc . &quot;
( 3 ) : the argument for the operator which is a name or string that is already set in the database .
&quot; for example , you can set an Advanced search across all the elements of the database with the following options : &quot;
if you want to group options you just need to use the check box at the end of the rule and then the button group@@ ing . the options then look like this :

this article / tutorial was mainly written by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed and scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web from your digital dark@@ room .
&quot; if the theme is on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , colour management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing work@@ flows . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t have to worry about colour management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated on the s@@ RGB colour space . ( see below for more information )
&quot; your only other photo issues are e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is de @-@ facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life for everyone so easy , why should one use another color space and get thoughts about colour management ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB in comparison to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors that we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e @-@ shaped region , and the colors in the s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare s@@ RGB with some bigger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ om and click Info and then click Info About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to c@@ alli@@ ate my monitor when I decided to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you &apos;re working in the s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ bri@@ ate your monitor , since s@@ RGB assumes that your ; on@@ itor works on s@@ RGB , then you must use either your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a suitable monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions , which can improve an image in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions Norm@@ alize , synchron@@ ize , automatic matching and contrast are added from the Edit Automatic correction menu try to make the best out of your colors . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this method scales the lumin@@ ous intensity over the entire image , so that the dark@@ est point black and the brigh@@ test point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade . this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or full @-@ washed . &quot;
&quot; this method adju@@ sts the brightness of the color of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible . sometimes the matching very good results in improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image , sometimes it also produces rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; automatic matching : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . it detects the dark and light border tones and adju@@ sts the red , green and blue channels to the complete hist@@ ogram region . &quot;
&quot; contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible when images are washed , and can be a good correction for bad photos . &quot;
white balance of &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is a little limited because of a color space with 8 @-@ bit per color . so if you can be too far away from the original picture , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in rough mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your chances of correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start it via the menu item paints white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left hand side , both the original picture and the preview of the target picture can be seen . the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target picture has a red marker . the L@@ umin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; on the top right , a hist@@ ogram is shown to change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well lit images , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or trim the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance . this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance with the list of default settings . the following settings are available : &quot;
the over@@ exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will get the combined result in white balance . this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
&quot; the buttons save as and load exactly this . every setting of the white balance that you have set , you can save it to a text file and load later . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button rever@@ ts all the filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; you can adjust the coding depth for each color channel of the processed image here . 8 @-@ bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this encoding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles . color mapping can be performed by the sub@@ window for the brightness settings . a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consul@@ ted in the chapter Color Management .
&quot; this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time . this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistake , so you will always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under color gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool color effects provide you with four color effects , a solar isolation effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a edge filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , Solar@@ isation was also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er , an effect that arose when a partially developed print was replaced by a short flash light and then completed the development of the image . the coloured , darker areas protected the sensitive phot@@ op@@ aper from the additional light . &quot;
&quot; the intensity controls the ion@@ ization . at approx . 50 % intensity , the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . a further up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment ultimately creates a negative image that does not produce photographic paper . &quot;
this is an example of the solar system effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ oth &quot; &quot; effect . it differs from satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . try it simple , it embell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted colour film made by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ terr@@ ot ; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts .
&quot; the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeat the strength of the ne@@ on light . in large images , the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment . &quot;
digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not un@@ common that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview . once you are satisfied with the result use the button O@@ k and you will be applied .
if you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem : a too big satur@@ ation . also in this case the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation instead of increasing it . if you like the result you can confirm the changes with O@@ k .
&quot; between the complex mold gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is set to improve the exposure . even if the dialog has a very complicated effect on this tool , you only need the range of the slider for the use purpose described here . concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . under the graph , three sli@@ ders are cli@@ cked into them and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn how to operate it is to move the regulator and watch out how the image changes .
&quot; on the right , the original and preview of the image can be viewed . the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image . on the left hand side , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : with this selection box you can set whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the bright tones and the bottom for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma @-@ values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pin@@ ts can be used in the preview of the original image to automatically adjust the input values of shadows , middle and light tones . furthermore , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
exit status : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to change the output values inter@@ actively as with the input values . the compression of the output values can be used e.g. to create a f@@ aded image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground .
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are automatically set depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
&quot; save as and load : with these buttons , the set values in the file system can be saved and loaded later . to do this , the Gim@@ p Levels format is used . &quot;
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the input of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the lumin@@ ance channels . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
&quot; below you can see an example of the alignment of the input values applied to red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture with ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target picture will be displayed . the preview will be dynamically updated according to your settings . on the right , the following options are available : &quot;
modi@@ fier channel : this selection box allows you to specify the channel that is changed by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two icons to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images taken with a digital camera , the linear mode of the most sensible is mostly the linear mode . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve to the right , for example the bright tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspon@@ ded with darker gab@@ les and that the corresponding image pixels are darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original picture a red marker is visible . if you shift this marker to the area you want to change , a suitable line is displayed on the curve representing the original value . create a point on this line and then move it up and down until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : with these buttons you can do exactly this . each curve you have created can be saved in the file system and later loaded . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p Cur@@ ve format .
&quot; if you use this method and the three color pi@@ p@@ ette buttons automatically create the check@@ points of the curve for all channels of shadow , medium and sun tones . activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original picture to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the option over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to display over@@ exposed pixels . if in more than one channel over@@ exposed pixels are found , you get the combined result displayed . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black and white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were set with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel bl@@ ender der &amp; digi@@ cam ; Image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel bl@@ ender is another sophisticated tool to mix the h@@ ues of the images . you can edit it from the menu Color channel bl@@ ender for image processing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and impact . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . &quot;
&quot; the preview of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you want to retain L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness even if you want to change the corresponding color components . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour space . the colour space consists of small noise arti@@ facts that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and whose noise pattern is different in each channel . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion by reducing the color space first . &quot;
&quot; save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . you can save any bl@@ ender setting for later , and then load it . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel bl@@ ender format . &quot;
&quot; the over@@ exposure indicator controls all color channels to find over@@ exposed pixels and to show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it &apos;s no effect to see the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was re @-@ adjusted . the L@@ umin@@ ance option is activated . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step because color images can be easily converted on the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford HP@@ 5 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene images and fits particularly well to portraits against the sky . &quot;
&quot; orange filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . similar to the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
red Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar li@@ on@@ aires at day@@ time .
yellow filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and therefore similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
S@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while adding a bit of cold in the sh@@ ading tones . this is very similar to the process of ble@@ aching a pressure and the re @-@ development in a s@@ qui@@ at@@ oner . this is typical for the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 c@@ ok@@ ine ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool texture apply you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to a picture .
&quot; adding a texture to your image regardless of whether it is a color image or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a canvas , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth or three dimension@@ ality of the texture on the image .
a paper tex@@ tured effect has been applied on the photo below . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
with the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool frame add can be added a decorative frame to add a picture .
keeping the eye of a viewer in the confin@@ es of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to put the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye . under picture frame add the module from the image processing .
&quot; type : with this parameter , set the desired frame type for your image . throughout the picture , the picture with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce will surround it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , coated with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; the target picture decorated with the frame will be larger than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for printing the images , especially if you have used the tool according to aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into a picture at any location . this is also possible in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; this tool is very intuitive to use . simply enter the text and place it with the mouse . use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply select a frame around the text and / or a semi @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; any setting you have chosen for your text can be changed until you press &quot; &quot; OK &quot; &quot; button . once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it can no longer be changed . &quot;
with the digi@@ cam ; tool template apply you can lay a template over a picture .
the Image template menu can be used in picture editing can be used to lay sten@@ cils on a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no restrictions about the size and orientation . however , you need to take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template to the digi@@ cam ; list box digi@@ kam @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; if you are using this tool for the first time , you need to set your template folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you copied the template files . these settings are noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder is set for the templates , a tree view that reflects the folder structure of the template folder appears . selecting a folder automatically refres@@ hes the template of the template . &quot;
&quot; under the Pre@@ view , there are three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and position of your image . &quot;
enlarge This button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; smaller : this knob shr@@ inks the image below . it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
move : use this button to move the image lying under the template . take the image and place it at the desired position .
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then be automatically adjusted to the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools for sharpen@@ ing . each of you has advantages in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy to create , but especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny pictures . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ ry mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per look . in fact , it sharp@@ ens not a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric vap@@ or and it makes a really good job here . &quot;
re@@ focus is possibly the best of the three since it really improves sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment .
&quot; images without focus , as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images need a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because the dig@@ itali@@ zation process needs to be combined with only minimal differences to one color point . this , in turn , causes sharp edges to be printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually require more subsequent sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users . &quot;
&quot; in JPEG pictures , a camera is often used for internal sharp@@ ness . images in rough format , on the other hand , must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scann@@ ers use a focus filter while reading the image . if you disable this , you will get control of your image . &quot;
&quot; in some situations , you can obtain useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo with the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use the menu entry for correc@@ ting sharpen@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; you should handle it carefully , as the results do not work very naturally : sharpen@@ ing increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies noise . in general , the most useful technique to shar@@ pen an image can re@@ focus the tool . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the image a bit sof@@ tly is much easier than to shar@@ pen it . use the tool to draw a soft sign with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ ble soft drawing and experiment something with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often generate good results and should be tried first . an increase in the radius or the amount intensi@@ fies the effect . if you make the blur@@ red mask too strong , noise and impression of gr@@ en@@ ades are generated near sharp edges . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i .
the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image that is added to the original . thereby the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set .
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount . thus , it is possible to define a minimum difference in this way for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharp@@ ness and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces , skies and water surfaces . &quot;
&quot; this is an example of the blur@@ red filter . the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image the ( 2 ) . blur@@ red mask was applied with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focused a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted Ent@@ f@@ alt@@ ungs @-@ Filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . this is better approach than trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener filtering .
&quot; in practice , the circular cle@@ av@@ age works much better than the Gau@@ ß &apos;s folding . the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which causes the mathematical result to be influenced by the source pix@@ ell@@ ates too far from the original pixel . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of circular spl@@ itting . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most pictures , the default value should result in good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation can help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation can be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the sharpen@@ ing effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filters : an increase of the noise filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , the image quality is very bad . &quot;
&quot; G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the G@@ auss &apos;s sharp@@ ness . use this parameter if your blur@@ ry is correct . in most cases , you should have this value to 0 to avoid annoying art@@ ef@@ acts . if you use a value un@@ equal zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase of the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select great values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the gauge &apos;s sharp@@ ness . &quot;
save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose . any re@@ focus parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all tri@@ mming , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise . the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible , but then leave unpleasant arti@@ facts later . &quot;
&quot; if you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; as JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
generally un@@ sharp masks produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by the un@@ sharp mask of a larger neighborhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
&quot; theoretically , un@@ sharp masks always have to create art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions it is impossible to remove the effect of blur@@ ring . the result of the FI@@ R Viennese filter is always at least as good as the sharp@@ ness mask . the FI@@ R Viennese filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small un@@ focused image :
this picture has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens .
&quot; for more information on the field correction methods in digital pictures , you can read a technical comparison in English under this address . &quot;
the knob smooth@@ es the sharp@@ ness of the area that was dark@@ ened in order to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink @-@ ink allows a modified color for the pup@@ il . if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones , then you can adjust it here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains different pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings fine , you can use the tab@@ s smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detail conservation p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the preservation of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ness over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpen@@ ing should be necessary retro@@ spec@@ tively . &quot;
&quot; alignment dependence Alpha &#91; 0,@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly in all directions , while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film gra@@ ding or CCD noise , a high value will produce wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts are best eliminated at a value near 1 . &quot;
&quot; fl@@ atten &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ es. p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; repeti@@ tions : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is passed . normally , 1 or 2 is enough . &quot;
&quot; angle step @-@ up da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle dependent integration of the an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic Alpha . if alpha is selected small , you should also choose small angles for a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs . &quot;
&quot; integrated stri@@ de length &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral step width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never larger than 2 . &quot;
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more of the quality that you receive by selecting this option is only low . it doubles the run@@ time . we therefore recommend it to allow it .
&quot; the buttons save as and load exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file , and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; it can take a long time and load a high CPU load , so you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City using an analog camera . as you can see there is a peculiar black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by a bad film deposit during the trip .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other art@@ ef@@ acts , e.g. from dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ iny noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; the following is a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced settings window will remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can blur@@ red the image . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing that the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again . &quot;
&quot; edges : controls edge accuracy for the sharp@@ ness . this value improves the filter frequency response . if it is too strong , the entire noise can be removed or noise tips can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend either change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the gam@@ eplay tolerance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas , which are typically rough@@ ened more strongly . however , it also lubric@@ ates the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; atten@@ u@@ ation : controls the alignment of the phase j@@ itter atten@@ u@@ ation . this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius responds to variations of the lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . &quot;
store under and Lo@@ ad : these buttons are used precisely for this . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
&quot; the solution to draw the image a little bit sof@@ tly is fortunately much easier than a picture to shar@@ pen . use tool to sof@@ ten the image with the menu entry Cor@@ rigi@@ ble soft drawing and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; photo Rest@@ oration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; the restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted art@@ ef@@ acts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gra@@ ining , scrat@@ ches , compression arti@@ facts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture creation . the texture composition is performed using a different tool , the image error correction . the algorithm for restoration was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS Lab@@ ors in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ s and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
JPEG Artef@@ acts reduce : compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm it produces some compression &amp; quot ; Artef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems .
&quot; the buttons save as and load exactly this . any setting of photo @-@ restoration can be saved to a text file , and later loaded . &quot;
&quot; photo @-@ restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a long time and pull up a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) HP @-@ 5 film with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO . you can see the in@@ famous film grain on the faces . the original picture is below ( 1 ) and the corrected unter ( 2 ) .
below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time tex@@ tures were reduced to an old color photo that was scann@@ ed with a scanner . you can see the scan arti@@ facts which were created by the scanner lighting and the photo paper . the original picture is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high @-@ quality raw @-@ mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &apos; bright pix@@ el@@ quot ; on a photo with a dark image extraction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file in the wizard with the Dark Image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should find the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the Wiz@@ ard notices the last dark image and re@@ charges it automatically in the next session . &quot;
the image area and preview help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . then select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the available filters :
&quot; average : an average of neighbouring pixels is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the default filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ quad@@ r@@ atic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) which is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure , applied . the original image has been enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected picture is visible under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ cam ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed corners , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can often not illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead , they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that the sensor reaches there . tel@@ eph@@ oto lenses may also show this behavior . &quot;
&quot; many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the f @-@ stop filter , which increases the necessary sh@@ utter speed under certain circumstances , which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide @-@ angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or smaller , since otherwise blur@@ red effects are caused by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure areas of today &apos;s felt and the color or gra@@ y@@ scale of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was done without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applies the transformation with a center filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three regul@@ ators , you can control the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of light power atten@@ u@@ ation at the point of the largest density filter . the standard density is 2.0 , resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or by random@@ ly a light intensity of 2 , . increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of vi@@ gn@@ etting , reduce it by a small degree . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels . you only need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more subtle adjustment of the exposure of the target image , let the values for brightness / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation out of the color gra@@ dation ; image processing from the Color Gra@@ ding menu . &quot;
this is an example of the vi@@ gn@@ etting correction applied to one image . the original picture ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected picture .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second degree treats the general geomet@@ rical distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third grade has a similar effect effect , but fla@@ ke at the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
the coefficient fourth degree correc@@ ts the remote corners opposed to that of the second degree . if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geometric distortion .
in general : this value controls the strength of distortion second degree . negative values can be corrected without distortion and positive values cushion distortion .
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the fourth grade . this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner Par@@ ameters &apos; has the opposite character of the General parameter . &quot;
zoom : this value res@@ umes the image size and thereby performs a correction of the first degree . negative values increase while positive image size decreases .
&quot; bright : this value adju@@ sts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners , while positive values increase it . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog with a Pre@@ view Pre@@ view illustrates the distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used for the next start as default values . &quot;
&quot; the pitch or cushion distortion should be performed prior to all tri@@ mming or size changes . ideally , perform this correction as the first one . if you want to cut a picture anew and then perform a spher@@ ical correction , the effect would be apparent to the wrong . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal aid line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black verti@@ ces . you can remove them using the tri@@ mming tool in the Trans@@ forming C@@ utting out of the image processing or via the Zoom slider of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motifs like taking pictures of the front , frames and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera with your hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the spher@@ ical correction applied to a church in Norway . the original picture is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture below ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method to simulate the infrared film of the G@@ imp@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website which is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the known Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ IR film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse , you can view the effect on different parts of the image . &quot;
&quot; below the Pre@@ view , you can set two parameters setting motion capture and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Fun@@ ge film gra@@ ding if you want to simulate the gra@@ iny texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO regulator changes the amount of film gra@@ ining and the domin@@ ance of color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow ! &quot;
&quot; since the filter color channels are mixed to reproduce infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is set under ( 1 ) and the processed image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights .
&quot; this is known by classic high @-@ speed films such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , the manufacturers mix big silver grains of photo@@ emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gra@@ zing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past . the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life . if you want this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny sight especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you need to use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the regulator , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , on ISO @-@ 24@@ 00 . if you need more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film production effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and processed the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity corresponds to ISO @-@ 1600 .
der &amp; digi@@ kam ; Filter oil painting produces the appearance of an oil painting . it uses a copyright protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice appearance like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two regul@@ ators to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better suited for large images . smooth@@ es , checks the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the hing@@ ness . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the processing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size is 1 and G@@ lät@@ te 17 .
the &amp; digi@@ cam ; filter coal drawing uses color and intensity gra@@ dients to create a cab@@ bage face . the lines that define the outline in drawing are emphasized . images of their gra@@ dients may change slowly therefore are not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you would have chosen to sket@@ ch yourself . this would be good pictures to start with .
&quot; there are two controllers with a value range from 1 to 100 , to control this effect . the upper slider sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower adju@@ sts the contrast ( smooth ) . &quot;
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the digi@@ cam ; filter engraving shapes your image in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; it works particularly well in pictures with a simple structure , where color is not the most important . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ing landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of the filtering . a value of 30 , corresponds to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving fil@@ ter@@ . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave @-@ blocks 2 : an@@ alog@@ ous to the wave @-@ blocks 1 the picture is distorted with a different version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and create a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects at any time with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom Un@@ shar@@ per : blur@@ ring the image along star shaped lines that eman@@ ate from a center point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring a zo@@ oming camera and thereby generates a dynamic expression of the often seen in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels by a focal point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ r : blur@@ ring the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object seems to come back into the background .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train taking photos , camera . &quot;
&quot; soft marker : blur@@ red the image sof@@ tly in the dark and strong in bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
sh@@ red@@ der sharp@@ ness : blur@@ red the image through random shift of pixels and thereby simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent blur@@ ring : finds the colour bas@@ ins in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , by filling with an average pixel value . &quot;
some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load . therefore you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish .
the ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your image . this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of the drops . since the drop@@ let size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce size for small images . number changes the number and density of drops . fish eyes change the visual effect of drops on the picture .
&quot; you can choose with the digi@@ cam ; image processing a area free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you then start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . &quot;
this is an example of the Reg@@ ent@@ rop@@ fen filter . the original image ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image ( 2 ) suggests a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it through mirr@@ oring or turning into the right orientation . &quot;
&quot; photo magni@@ fication is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo , with minimal loss of image quality . &quot;
the big question is how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you re @-@ invent or guess the missing information ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm that is used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself .
if a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size change . choose to change size change in the menu and specify the target values . the dialog can be seen below .
&quot; the tool to change size uses a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality , then try the tool for infl@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; many image processing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. Spl@@ ine Inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ kam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you need to tell the tool how to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
&quot; preserve aspect ratio : if this setting is enabled , the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary if very much noise is present , since it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the buttons save as and load are used exactly for this . enlarge each collection for photos , can be saved as a text file and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; infl@@ ating the photo is very fast with what it does , but it can take a long time and pull up a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
you can see below an example of a photo magni@@ fied by adding a small color image to the double size . the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of linear expansion to compare .
&quot; cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to assemble a picture . to cut a photo you simply need to use the mouse just the rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle . you will then see this rect@@ angle while you move the mouse . &quot;
when you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off . you can change the size of the area to be cli@@ pped by dra@@ gging at the corners of the rect@@ angle . a new rect@@ angle can be created by simply using the left mouse button .
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button View button of image editing in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl + + X ) . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact . &quot;
&quot; in the tool After aspect ratio , you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format . in high @-@ format , the larger value of the height and in the cross format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimet@@ ers , inches or any other physical size . you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for phot@@ op@@ aper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the dialog , you can set the area to the greatest possible depending on the chosen relationship and orientation . &quot;
&quot; when you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation . the changed image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF tables , so that EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
the settings of the cooperation help make it possible to hide help so that you can put together your images better . these help are :
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonic divi@@ des are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third @-@ el@@ bow , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonious tri@@ angles on the diag@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; golden centre : the golden centre is a division of different natural growth patterns , such as the spiral of a Nau@@ til@@ us shell or the leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden division is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct their temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden ratio in all times when you put together your images , buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from the Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc ; the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden middle . &quot;
the golden centre provides smo@@ other auxiliary lines if you put together a picture . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos . compared to the third @-@ level rule , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture . this kind of composition leads the viewer &apos;s gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ rical visual flow . &quot;
&quot; another rule is the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . it should be something that the eye is at the center of the composition . this can be a line or different objects . &quot;
&quot; the Golden Tri@@ angles also derive from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . your verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not con@@ tra @-@ angled tri@@ angles . diag@@ onal to place these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic . &quot;
if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame you create an effect of professional phot@@ ograph@@ ers called dynamic symmet@@ ry . try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you can &apos;t achieve .
the Horiz@@ on@@ tal mirror and verti@@ ces options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions .
&quot; with the Color button , you can set the color of the help lines . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; when you make a photo , it &apos;s easy that you don &apos;t hold the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this with the digi@@ cam ; image processing and the tool free rotation . choose to transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider corner . the values on this slider are indicated in degrees . with the button Pre@@ ferences you can reset the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on the top right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
&quot; after you have turned a picture , you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair this is to use the function Trans@@ forming tri@@ mming from image processing . &quot;
an elegant way to trim the image is the Automati@@ cally cut function . select one of the following options :
&quot; the anti @-@ ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after rotation , but note the above warning . &quot;
all perspective transform@@ ations are carried out by a fixed point to the so @-@ called reference point . this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . you will then automatically re@@ compu@@ te the preview . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including the empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
left corner : displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area .
angle right above : displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle left below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area .
angle right below : displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective the image becomes a little blur@@ red . for a single adjustment this effect is small , but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you adapted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean this is to cut the image with transform@@ ations from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; the tool is used to post@@ p@@ one part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite . this is not rotation , the image is distorted . in other words , a rect@@ angle is turned into a parall@@ el@@ ogram . you can start this module about transforming sciss@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles . if you press pres@@ ets , the angles are reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane . &quot;
&quot; move the mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; after you have done the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image is wi@@ ped a bit . for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two rein@@ for@@ cements producing twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sh@@ ear@@ ing , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transform@@ ations from the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , from the way these libraries are compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with &amp; digi@@ cam ; &quot;
&quot; because of this dependency on other libraries it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system , but they will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF among them . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; displays only files in formats to which you know . this happens on the basis of file extension and a comparison of this with a pre@@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , it will show &amp; digi@@ kam ; the file in the image processing is displayed ; you can change this list of file extensions to &amp; digi@@ cam ; see Con@@ figuration section for more information . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format to be used . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in the Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression processes to digital images . redundant information is reduced in order to save image data in a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG on the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also save los@@ s@@ less when specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw image format , please read Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour very helpful guides in English . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ cam ; in the Con@@ figuration section you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ cam ; . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw pictures only with the d@@ cra@@ b program , which is included in &amp; digi@@ cam ; all supported cameras can be seen at the bottom of the web page of Dave Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats supported by &amp; digi@@ cam ; &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support recording short films . these clips are often stored in A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . however , it is not a film editing program and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to display or edit movies . if you click on a movie file &amp; digi@@ cam ; the &amp; k@@ de ; settings to play movies to start playing . &quot;

many tools you need to do the photo editing are in &amp; digi@@ kam ; your description follows here .
&quot; all picture editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ tness , noise suppression , re@@ focus , blur@@ ring , &amp; etc ; . use a single dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter to the current image . to the left of it allow five buttons to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertically split without dup@@ licate . the left pane displays the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizontal parts without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
the left area shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
the upper part shows the original and the lower compared to the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ Style : displays the preview if the mouse is not in the preview area , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over and under@@ exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general installation page .
( 3 ) : the frame to select the preview . you can drag the frame with the mouse inside the picture and drop it on the part of the image you want to preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the page bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self @-@ explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters in shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive card search tool based on the Mar@@ ble mini program . you can zoom in or zoom in with the mouse wheel . press C@@ trl ; left mouse button to pull a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to manipul@@ ate color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; the P@@ allet @-@ Files that are installed by &amp; k@@ de may apply either for the entire system or only one user . in the latter case , they are in your Personal Fol@@ der for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog box , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed in the pallet view as a line . it can be moved by clicking the area next to a color .
it shows the colour next to it . the color is described below the pallet view . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor over there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
the color is either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode over@@ write is selected . this mode can be set by selecting the check@@ box over@@ writing under Bei@@ m cursor .
&quot; a selection that was created in this way as described in the last section can be used together with the actions Copy , Cut and Pa@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a line character , if another color follows . if so three numbers are in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color choos@@ er can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .
select a color anywhere on the screen and then find it in the color sel@@ ector on the left side .

integration into &amp; kate ; and &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ( so that a change of the graph in &amp; kate ; the graph re@@ counts and in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; )
menu to open the graph in &amp; kate ; to open or to open the graph in &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; in a &amp; kate ; component
loading large graphs ( currently there are problems with about 1000 no@@ des and a h@@ ack to show more than these no@@ des )
additional needed software : &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that pres@@ upp@@ oses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ Tool &amp; dot ; for displaying graphs . needed in detail :
&quot; the main window displays the opened graphs , each in a separate sub @-@ window . initially , if you start &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; without starting a argument , the main window is empty like in the lower screen shot . in this case , the tool@@ bar contains only the icon file and the ( empty ) list of last opened files . click on the first icon to open the dialog file . &quot;
&quot; after choosing one or more &amp; dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen@@ shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; -@@ key ) ; &quot;
zoom is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum cr@@ ushing of a graph .
&quot; if the file is currently being modified by another program , the following window will appear : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph is to be re@@ charged or whether you want to ignore the change . if you want to change your decision later , you can change the menu item settings c@@ graph@@ Viewer ; set up ... use , see also . &quot;
&quot; if you open a graph@@ ite file outside of a running &amp; co@@ graph@@ viewer ; in the file browser or in the command line , you have the choice if you want to open a new &amp; k@@ ima@@ viewer ; instance , or want to display the graph in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but can also change it with the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; at program start , you can re@@ open all graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice both as well as later . &quot;
you can also specify how the graph should be split into several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be freely chosen .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph will be fit to this page . if you maintain the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled from the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with one graph distributed on several pages without header and with another font
&quot; the Ref@@ res@@ h Shop page gives the option to specify behavior when a file has been modified on the hard drive , eg ; from another program . you can specify a default behavior ( automatically re@@ charge or ignore the changes ) or let the program ask for each time . &quot;
&quot; the page Open gives the possibility to specify the behavior of the graph viewer ; if a graph is opened outside a current session , you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the session already running ) or determine that each time it is requested . &quot;
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of &amp; k@@ graph viewer ; you can specify a default behavior ( open or not open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked for each start afterwards .
&quot; the context menu , which usually appears on a single click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up further possibilities : &quot;
&quot; here you can choose among different &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries , as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z , are : &quot;
the algorithm sets the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) and tries to produce as short edges as possible and as few edge over@@ laps as possible .
&quot; the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ ene . it produces graphs in accordance with the spring model . in doing so , the Kam@@ ada Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used , which is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi @-@ dimensional sc@@ aling . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm creates a spring@@ board model for ung@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ ct@@ man Rein@@ gold He@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid trigger for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graphs . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the k@@ not circular according to the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and Wiese , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multi @-@ cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that will then be executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph@@ ite file as a parameter , and output the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . &quot;
&quot; speci@@ fies the type of graph ( strai@@ gh@@ tened or er@@ ect ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directed , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ ed graphs ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is activated , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; displays the What is the mouse cursor . with this mouse cursor , click on a &amp; GUI ; element to get more help to this element ( if any ) . &quot;
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source repository .
&amp; k@@ graph viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; program that uses the &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z ; -@@ tools to display . it needs the following packages :
&quot; a special device is not necessary to use &amp; k@@ ima@@ viewer ; in the Settings menu , you will find more options . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the tool@@ bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid , in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; if the current file has been modified , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to save the changes . after that , a dialog appears where you can choose whether the icon should be created from a template , or whether you want to start from scratch . &quot;
&quot; restore the last rever@@ ted step . if you do not have a step back , this function is de@@ activated . &quot;
adds the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
set the current symbol in gra@@ y@@ scale . this can create colors that do not coinci@@ de with those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de .
&quot; does not change the symbol , but sets the current character color to the color of the point on which you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right it shows you the x and y coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current canvas , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
adds the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up ... a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; add ... , Edit ... and Rem@@ ove the templates for Standard File , Source File , Com@@ pressed File &amp; etc ; Change . &quot;
&quot; select Transpar@@ ent pixels or show Lin@@ e@@ ale and insert single @-@ color : or a chess board as a transparent display . you can also adjust the size : the car@@ os to small , medium and large as well as the color 1 : and Color 2 : choose . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module provides images to read and save new images .
this module can be used to read and save new images from external sources . currently two sources can be used :
scan images : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner that supports the San@@ e project or another source like Video Stre@@ ams . to make this work you have to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you open the menu entry picture , a dialog appears that lets you select between all available sources on your computer . here , select the source from which you want to get the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window will appear in that you can replace the default values duc@@ r@@ h to select your image accordingly . view the preview and customize the area to your needs before using the button scanning the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right , lower corner . &quot;
make sure that the window is completely displayed as some settings may not be displayed otherwise .
&quot; after you have pressed the button , you have to wait until the scan is completed and the window to specify the destination image appears . here , you can specify the compression and type of the image file . remember that the type BM@@ P is not compressed and therefore very large files created . you also need to select the folder &amp; # 160 ; select or create by saving the image . &quot;
screen shots can be created after you selected in the Import &gt; Screen Sa@@ ver menu . a window will appear in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ di :
select The complete desktop to read to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; when all your own program windows are selected , the calling program will disappear so you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , you will read the currently visible work@@ space . if you have selected the complete desktop , only the window will be read under the mouse . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen@@ shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other work surfaces , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot has been created , the dialog options of the target image will appear with the options described above . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Calendar does not currently have a documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot;
this module archives your albums on CD / DVD media with the K@@ 3@@ b burning program . you can simply select the albums to be archi@@ ved . an HTML interface can be created for convenient navigation . also the Auto@@ Play option is available for Windows platforms .
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I modules extend the program in which you are loaded to add additional functions . you can integrate additional menus , keyboard short@@ cuts and additional capabilities into the program . you can install as many modules as you want within the calling program . &quot;

Fli@@ ck@@ r is an online photo management online . with Fli@@ ck@@ r it is possible to send his photos to people that are important . you can show your favorite photos of the world and show photos of your camera mobile and show your photos in a safe and private way around the world .
the ex@@ porting module to Fli@@ ck@@ r can be used to upload images from your computer to a Fli@@ ck@@ r server on the Internet .
&quot; if you use the module for the first time , you will be guided through the process of generating a token . this is used for your authentication . so it is your ID to Fli@@ ck@@ r . a browser is started so you can login to Fli@@ ck@@ r . &quot;
&quot; after successful registration , the module can send photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r &apos;s website . you will be presented the following page after a successful registration . &quot;
&quot; simply close the browser window and return to the program . after you have pressed Yes , you will get the dialog to upload photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r . this will be shown in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when the ex@@ porting module is started to Fli@@ ck@@ r for the second time , you will be greeted with the following dialog , which displays the current access per@@ missions that the module displays . for up@@ loading you need write permission . you will be asked if you want to continue with these per@@ missions . &quot;
&quot; the button to add photos should be pressed once after you set all the other options . with this button , you can select the photos you want to upload in a file selection box . when you press the O@@ k button , upload the photos to Fli@@ ck@@ r Server . &quot;
the keyword field can be filled with a list of words separated by comm@@ a . these are added to the image as keywords during upload .
&quot; with options Public , Friends and Fam@@ il@@ lie you can adjust the per@@ missions to your pictures . by default , the photos are classified as private . &quot;
&quot; if you select the option change the size of the photos before up@@ loading , the photos before up@@ loading are changed in size . the size is taken from the value entered at maximum size . &quot;
the maximum size can be used to specify the maximum height of the images . size is changed so that the aspect ratio remains constant .
the K@@ IP@@ I module gallery export is a tool to export your picture collection to a gallery server
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Galerie @-@ Export has no documentation at present . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization allows you to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image and the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF keywords of the image and loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools to locate images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , long@@ itude and l@@ atitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your pictures with geographic data you need a GPS track as XML file in GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ d can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
picture Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization of Kor@@ rel@@ ator . this interface can lead a number of previously selected pictures with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and call the menu . the above @-@ to @-@ see dialog appears . to allow a possible correlation of time and loc@@ alization , you need to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . this file contains , of course , data that were recorded at the same locations at the same time as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; if the file is loaded , an automatic correlation is performed which indicates the coordinates in red . GPS track records are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera battery must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time@@ zone . set your camera time zone here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera distance . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you don &apos;t have track data from one place for pictures you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will then cor@@ relate all images in this area .
&quot; the Options Inter@@ pol@@ ation and difference in minutes can be used if you have no suitable data . if you know that in reality a location is located in a large time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ related to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos in the same place . since the dialog gets the coordinates from one call to the next , you just need to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set using the displayed map . to do this , select the region you are looking for and enlarge it again and again , until you have reached a sufficient level of accuracy . the card can be selected between card mode , satellite image and mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are possibilities to attach the GPS data to the images . here is a small script that the exi@@ ft@@ pool uses to provide a pile of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool for ex@@ porting a set of albums as HTML pages .
&quot; this module can export your albums to a picture gallery of HTML pages with version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages , and specify the parameters for HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to enable the best possible internation@@ alization . &quot;
&quot; the tab has four tab in which the settings can be adapted . the tab sel@@ ector allows you to select all the albums that are to be exported to HTML . you only need to select these albums . the three buttons on the right , you can quickly select a large number of albums . &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general appearance and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . if you click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image will be displayed . otherwise the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ show &quot;
the Ri@@ der Album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be saved with all your images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export which contains everything will be created there .
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG format , the EX@@ IF information of your original images is also stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; with other color depth , you can change the default color depth , which of course influences the file size . all other settings are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the thumb@@ nails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , these are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to break the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically , so you can read the program messages to see if errors occurred during creation . the web browser is automatically started to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL @-@ based tool for viewing pictures .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I image viewer allows you to view a selection of images and to perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or de@@ br@@ is . the viewer can be used with short commands and mouse buttons . it has been developed for quick image display and quick access to its functions . &quot;
&quot; after the start , an image will be displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed into a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for modi@@ fying images without affecting your quality .
&quot; this module allows for the actions taken below to save images in JPEG format , without the usual losses of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of los@@ s@@ less storage is that the file size is rising , as no compression of the color information takes place . this can be found e.g. with the P@@ NG format . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor currently has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the mailing list k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module , you can copy data from one image to another . select the image you want to copy in the main program and then invoke the import function . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy it from anywhere , but do not write in any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see what formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG encoding module is a tool to convert a series of images into a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module also uses the M@@ j@@ peg@@ tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages . you can also add an audio file in MP@@ 2 or WAV of Sli@@ deshow . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slideshow . with this module , you can create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . finally , you can use the K@@ 3@@ b program to burn the medium . &quot;
you must first select the images to be packed into the m@@ peg slideshow . then you can create the module via Tools MPEG Sli@@ deshow .
the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there you can also change sorting of the images respectively the contents of the list .
&quot; after you are satisfied with your list , you should adjust the other settings . the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you are planning to re @-@ select the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is pres@@ et and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step you should indicate the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the picture transition is defined below . a low value produces very sudden , a high contrast very smooth image changes . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should let them black . you can set the name and path of the created file under the name of the MPEG output file . keep the extension mp@@ g as possible . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file under the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after you customize all settings , you can start coding the production of the movie . depending on the speed of your computer , you can now quickly or quietly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show when you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a critic appears that Ko@@ di@@ ver or Tools are missing , you can adjust the paths to the programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button Settings on the bottom right corner . &quot;
the printer assistant lets you print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.g. useful to improve you or print out the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import or convert your images stored in RA@@ W format in one of three formats : JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
the conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ v by Dave Coff@@ in . an original quotation from him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ p that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get better results with d@@ cra@@ v .
first select the RA@@ W file to be converted and run the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the button Pre@@ view you can view the effect of your current settings on the picture .
&quot; you can now adjust the values to optimize the conversion process . the first option determines if the camera settings are to be used for white balance . the main parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue amplifier can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later on . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be selected so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch does not have any effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can select one of the three output formats and save the conversion output . the file name stays the same and only the extension will be adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all the information of your image and uses los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you plan to edit your images frequently , or later use it elsewhere , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality is deterior@@ ating . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file is stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which is the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write existing file . this is useful if they were created in an earlier attempt . however , a preview is not available . the progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the starting number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package .
&quot; proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically , depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . &quot;
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option e.g. to adjust your image to the screen format .
not proportional : not proportional res@@ izing in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed with this option .
&quot; preparation : prepare the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target picture , including background size , edge size and background color , will be adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before . you can drag and drop additional images on the list of images to be sent .
&quot; after you have started the module , the images window with the pictures you have selected will be displayed . you can add additional images using the button &quot; &quot; Add images &quot; . &quot; for the last selected image , a preview of the right @-@ hand side will be displayed . &quot;
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images to be sent .
&quot; with the button Rem@@ ove images , the selected pictures are removed from the list of images to be sent . &quot;
after selecting all the pictures you can open the button OK to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you just need to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures you have selected are already attached as attachment .
don &apos;t pay attention to sending too many pictures at once . most email accounts have limitations for the size of emails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used again each time you change it .
&quot; select your email client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you will need to specify the correct path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you use the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after adding comments to a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and the mail is attached . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format below the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted to the los@@ s@@ less formats like TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality should not be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in file format and are the original files in JPEG format , then the original file data will be added to the images to be sent . &quot;
&quot; when the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , on the search for errors . your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the Advanced slide show , a window with questions like you want to display your slideshow will appear . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation will enable very elegant transitions using Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the File Name option shows that the file name of the images is displayed in the left lower corner during the presentation .
the loop option ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then manually ab@@ ort with Es@@ c .
the option pictures random@@ ly make sure that the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
&quot; between the images , the distance between the images can be set . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds correspond to 1.5 seconds and are a good default value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the selected transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can select . acci@@ dentally you select another effect between the images .
&quot; during slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the upper left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to turn it on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the lower left edge of the screen , you can see the current file name , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module time &amp; date is currently no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. attention : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool to set a picture as a background image for the work surface .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your pictures and videos with notes , you can browse with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; through these brow@@ ses , see picture . as you can see through a comparison with the picture , there are now in each group , so in people , places and in the group keywords entries . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you can see the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations . additionally , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard drive and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; when you press the mouse to the entry persons , the view of the browser changes . see picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select another person , only the images on which both persons can be seen . by this selection method you can limit the number of images displayed by a few thousand images on some single images . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected all the people , places and other settings , you can display thumb@@ nails to view the images of your area of activity . &quot;
&quot; in the picture each person has the same icon in front of her name . you can with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , for each person to save his own thumb@@ nail , this also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see also the picture . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button on the right side of the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu , you can select what view you want to use for each category . this has the advantage that you can display symbols with pictures of persons and at the same time a list of keywords ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable pictures for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you must decide for yourself which image is to be displayed for each individual person . to do this , you need to open the Image Editor window ( described in detail ) and display the image for the person in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the Find dialog in the main window , a dialog will show you which is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . you can view this dialog on the image again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the Lab@@ eling or Description field , the cap@@ tions and descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date after which you want ; the date can be either a part of the total date , i.e. 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can search all images by specific names as you can see in the picture . here , according to images on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; . if you don &apos;t like to read manuals , but rather try to try out features , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , screen@@ shot and introductory videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog , select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select the menu entry &quot; photo@@ album &quot; in the menu . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a related HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar you can see here : . as the name already says , this bar shows you date statistics about the pictures in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar then displays a different unit . you can switch between the units , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively used in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( if you select a date , the first picture of this date will be displayed in the preview pane ) , and the time bar always displays the current date of the images displayed at the moment when you navigate in the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding the mouse button down and dra@@ gging the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time information . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with two ways to create HTML pages with your images . the one is in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other is available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album is described . &quot;
&quot; before HTML pages are created you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three categories of content , layout and target . in the following , each area is described more closely . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album ; HTML example pages you see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select if a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; export file is to be created on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information displayed to the viewer is obvious . for example , all pictures of a party are visible . &quot;
&quot; in this section , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are unique , which is why this is not specifically addressed . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images . thus , those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , no longer download images which have for example a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have defined . so , you can browse your images with low resolution , which leads to a lower transfer time . if you want to get an image larger , it changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setup area , place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new sub@@ folder for each subsequent set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved . this folder will be saved and automatically added next time . this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if they are really all visible to viewers . if you select a URL for the base folder , a web browser will be launched after the pages are created . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you have to manually copy them there . so that the import function , see , correctly , you must specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings you have just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or anywhere else , with other users of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; coming together , you may want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ im file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ im files , internal and external . they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images . the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can get all the images together and share this file so independently . however , the obvious disadvantage is the file size . &quot;
&quot; you can create a .@@ k@@ im file either directly from the File Ex@@ porting ... or along with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ im file together with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in a two @-@ fold way . first , it searches the images that are located in the file of the .@@ k@@ im file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you &apos;ve specified when creating HTML files will only be possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ im file by means of HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can access via the File Ex@@ porting ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ in files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; if you want to copy the manual to the .@@ k@@ im file , you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ im file . &quot;
copy &amp; k@@ photo@@ album with the Automati@@ cally Copy option near the .@@ k@@ im file ; the images automatically for you .
.@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to comp@@ ress the files .
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send pictures to your friends , you might not want to send the images in full size , because the .@@ k@@ im file would otherwise be very big . &quot;
&quot; if you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ in from the web browser or from the File Im@@ porting ... select , will import &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the exported database as described in described . &quot;
&quot; the wizard for im@@ porting consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then , in which folders the import pictures should be copied . &quot;
&quot; it may be that you person@@ alize the category Person@@ s of the file to be imported ( if you are a domain ) , while this category is called persons in your database . therefore , you will be asked in the third dialog window which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories these are in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database . for example , see the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups . for example , if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will pass the various steps of ( 1 ) Set of information about your images , via ( 2 ) searching and standing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been expanded and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about pictures , but often this also includes videos . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; stores all its information in the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml in the top of your images . this is a simple XML file that you can backup with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , where you want . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; remember the folder in which your images are stored and used automatically in future starts . if you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if you want to read another folder tree with pictures , you can start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / pictures / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu entry settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... enter a window with which you can change the settings of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will explain the different settings . &quot;
&quot; to the left you see six different icons that allow you to view the settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , a detailed help is available , which you can call the F1 key by pressing a button and click on the option you want . &quot;
&quot; it has been described how you can define different properties for each image , e.g. people , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
see the dialog which is used to edit existing groups . for each existing group you can select a label and a symbol .
&quot; in the Options section , sub @-@ categories have already been mentioned . in the Options dialog , you can set up complete member groups , i.e. , for example , all members of a group at once in a group , rather than all groups of a member like explained in . &quot;
&quot; in the left half of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window , there is a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; spl@@ its its module system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plugin interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be accessed through the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; since the modules are shared between multiple applications with each other , it may be that the modules were tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore , you should always test new modules with the demo database , before using them on your own pictures . &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules over K@@ IP@@ I are very different , making it possible that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums do not work . this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications , which also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications do not support their images in albums : this kind of order does not support , simulate it for some modules the order for albums so that you can use the functions with a photo@@ album . &quot;
&quot; simul@@ ates &amp; k@@ photo@@ albums ; the current album , which simply corresponds to the current view , is all the images that show you the preview at the moment . &quot;
besides the current album &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; the modules also need a list of albums . here &apos;s &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as follows :
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , e.g. all persons , then each entry of this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category you &apos;ve defined in the Settings dialog as a category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category Person@@ s , then &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; so do so if you would have selected people to view this and pass it on to the module . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
on the picture you see an example of a starting screen as soon as you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start with your own pictures .
&quot; as you are used by any other K@@ DE application , you can see a menu and tool@@ bar at the top . under the tool@@ bar you will see the window with which you have entered your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main functions of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; is the possibility to see each picture with ann@@ ot@@ ations . this includes information about the persons who are shown on the picture , where the image has been recorded , etc . you can use each image individually or for a larger number of pictures at the same time . &quot;
&quot; all these comments can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these comments when using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; you can see three lists with a text box by defining persons , places and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; since you can always use them again if you enter information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is based on moving images within the list : for example , if you have a family celebration and shown on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , thereby , the used names are moved upwards to find and assign persons more quickly . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to receive an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the icon for sorting by date under the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may still want to edit all selected pictures and add these images with notes . in this case , simply click on the above and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have recorded multiple images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these pictures and use the menu item multiple entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . in addition , San Francisco and Los Angeles are located in California . &quot;
&quot; on the picture you can see a browser window that shows the USA as an over@@ board . to indicate that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the comment dialog context menu , it is possible to add an entry into an existing or new over@@ - or sub@@ category . additionally , you can also drag an entry into a category and put it there to sort it into a sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the single elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the top edge of the frame , and you can also create your own window by dra@@ gging it out of the window pane . &quot;
&quot; when you customize the appearance of the window to your needs that you are satisfied with the settings , click on the Options button ... which gives you the possibility to store the current structure and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide a frame completely . if you want to get this window later shown again , use the Options button ... and then hide the window . this process can be seen in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the entry picture in the browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected pictures , or all images if you have no filter . an example of this can be seen here . you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image is set as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; if you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the image viewer . if you have not opened a window with a picture viewer , a new display window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete images in the image preview . simply select the respective images from which you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select from the Edit selection menu . now the window will appear you can see in the picture .
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you with a solution for this problem . you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; namely , you need to have the images stored somewhere , so you can record and k@@ photo@@ album ; you can see the view of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all required images can be loaded from the hard disk . &quot;
&quot; for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 however , the thumb@@ nails are available , so &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , you can &apos;t view these images with the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires that you copy files from the folders and copy it back . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; does not support it until now to avoid inser@@ ting the CD . so if you want to avoid the mess of your pictures , please purchase a larger hard drive to save all images on it . &quot;
&quot; in the pictures menu you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end , you can block all the images that you may see for others in@@ accessible and click &quot; &quot; Lock &quot; &quot; to lock the menu entry All except current view . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry to susp@@ end images , which means that all images you have locked out will be hidden . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to specify a password that must be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply select password change in the privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this image protection is by no means very secure . on one hand , all images on the hard drive and on the other hand can anyone who can access the file inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you want to spend all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours on hours with it is natural that you want to look at them at some point . for this reason , &amp; k@@ photo@@ album has a picture _ and video viewer . you can start this from the preview , as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in the picture . of course , it shows the image , but additional information you have to enter via the picture , for example who is on the picture , when and where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the info@@ box on the upper part of the image you want to see , you can easily drag and drop them with the mouse . you can also configure what information is displayed and if any information is displayed . &quot;
&quot; some words in the info@@ box are under@@ lined . if you click here , the browser , see the matching entries to this . if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the pictures of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have multiple images loaded in the viewer , you can switch between them before and back by using the buttons image high and down . you can jump to the first and final image with Pos@@ 1 and end . these functions are also available from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; if multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can run it as slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl + S key . &quot;
a very useful feature of the viewer of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; it &apos;s possible to switch to full screen mode . in this mode the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input key to switch to full screen mode and back .
&quot; when you use the viewer , you can zoom in and zoom into the image . to zoom out , you can pull up a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus button , you can zoom out The Plus key zo@@ oming in the middle of the picture . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image will not be displayed . with the key button , the zoom uses the zoom , so that each pixel on the screen corresponds to a pixel of the image . &quot;
&quot; note that the only zoom operations that work for videos , that are in and out with the plus and minus button . &quot;
&quot; with the rotary functions from the context menu , you can rotate the image . this does not work with videos . you can make comments on the current image using the menu item notes from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when you look at pictures it can happen that you find a picture with a person whose name you forgot to put on the image . at the moment , you can preview the image and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter that name . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of pictures to a printer to get the pictures developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad as you view one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while you look at them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pushing the corresponding letter . in view , you see a picture in which the features A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; once you have selected features on your pictures , they are available in your browser . so you can see all the images you edit , print or whatever you have selected , so you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and especially features can be displayed in preview view . if you can display categories in the preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the feature after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it &apos;s not clear what you want to show on a picture . for this case allows you &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; to paint on the picture .
&quot; the batch is not stored with the image , but in the database . in this way , you can undo your painted later . &quot;
you can see a picture on the painted picture . to switch on the painting mode of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; select on the picture from the context menu . to complete the painting simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window .
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you must have the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully profi@@ cient , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely read and understand . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the properties properties and the object is displayed in the wi@@ re@@ mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time , but not the object of an already selected object , as all sub@@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object in the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu is displayed so that you can choose the correct position : &quot;
&quot; by del@@ eting either from the menu bar under Edit or from the context menu of the right mouse button , you can remove selected objects from the scene previously . &quot;
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with error description . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; enter the user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; reference to the displayed object with help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this property . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or a part of a texture , you can see a preview in the Properties view . &quot;
&quot; press preview in the landscape view and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the selected texture . as default , the entire texture is rendered , even if you want to render only a part of the texture ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick locally . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the control points of the camera . you can drag these check@@ points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is chosen , the control points disappear and a small cross appears in the wire model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse inside the entire window . &quot;
&quot; each object has a level of exposure as a wire model . you can specify this value relative to the level of view of the parent object or as absolute value . objects are only displayed when selected , or their visibility level is smaller or equal to the level of visibility selected in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window ordering or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust it arbitr@@ arily . you can also save several window orders and easily switch between different arrangements . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below an existing view , drag the tap to the top or bottom of a view . a rect@@ angle shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the tap to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views on one another , drag the tap into the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map front in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window ordering is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . to solve a view from the anch@@ oring , drag the tap to the desktop or click the small arrow pointing to the left in the bar panel . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can add additional views into the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for any type of views . &quot;
you can save the current window view with view window ordering ... save it . it displays a dialog where you can save the window configuration under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click on the Ren@@ dering icon Ren@@ dering the tool@@ bar icon or select the menu item view scene . &quot;
&quot; a render mode matches the entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of the rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert as many R@@ ender modes , from a fast preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di menu in the View menu , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
&quot; each render mode has a name . you can enter any name , but sense is a name that lets you know the properties of the mode . &quot;
&quot; in the map size you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you want to render only a small area of the image , select the check box sub@@ section and enter the image editing to render into the input fields . &quot;
in the combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray use ; for rendering use . this goes from a very simple colour and light model to a model with complex diff@@ user reflection lighting . a detailed description of the render properties can be found in the user &apos;s manual to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
&quot; when a picture is rendered with just one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è pattern or window effects in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not displayed if they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called anti @-@ ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally , pictures with this property look better . &quot;
&quot; when you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , comp@@ utes and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as a standard , an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is constantly re@@ distributed and adap@@ tively , because each pixel depends on the calculated color values . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray follows a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels passes the given threshold , then both pixels are calculated by tracking a particular additional number of pixels with super @-@ sampling . if you set the depth value to 4 , a grid of 4 will be calculated with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional beams per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;
di@@ ff = abs ( r 1 -@@ r 2 ) + abs ( g 1 -@@ g 2 ) + abs ( b 1 -@@ b 2 )
&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 beams per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold , the pixel will be divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are individually pursued and tested for further sub@@ divisions . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be set with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch J@@ it@@ tering , change &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for the quality of Ren@@ der@@ ns is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property .
&quot; on this map , you can set whether the alpha channels should be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent if the corresponding rays have no object . &quot;
&quot; opens a new window for the display of the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly ends , you can find the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; to import a &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray scene , select File Im@@ porting ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
&quot; currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet complete command set by &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; . when im@@ porting error messages or warnings , a dialog window displays a list of all messages . &quot;
&quot; if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; import , write this source text between the two special comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End . &quot;
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree to the editor to export the source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source code to the text file in the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it to the object tree . &quot;
with copy and paste in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; and in your editor you can paste source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in Properties @-@ View , open &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; user documentation to the displayed object . here , set the path to your document and the version . supported are versions 3.@@ 1@@ g and 3.5 . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example height field data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to these files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the control points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type features .
&quot; you can adjust object capture points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . here , you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and therefore a better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects , such as the sphere , you can set the detail level separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you cross high detail faith@@ fulness for advanced projections , all wire @-@ model views are further sub@@ divided when the camera uses an extended projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions of perspective and vertical projections . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a chess board pattern of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; when you tick the floor , a bottom is rendered below the objects . the bottom is displayed in a chess board pattern consisting of two adjustable colors . &quot;
&quot; if you tick the edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and threshold values . you can find more details about the parameters in the R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di section . &quot;
on this page you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the section window orders will explain how you can create and save window orders .
the combination field standard window ordering : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ Mod@@ er ; used the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . a new arrangement can be created with the Add button and delete a selected setup with the Rem@@ ove button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list under the name shows all the views for the selected window ordering . new views can be created with the Add button and delete selected views with the button Del@@ ete .
&quot; with the new column you create a new column on the right side of the existing windows , with Un@@ ten you anchor the window under the existing window , with flash@@ cards you get a map view together with the previous view and floating the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more accurate knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : a ball on one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should keep in mind the following warnings , before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t set a camera , no rules for rendering can be applied , as a result you get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you do not insert light sources , your whole scene lies in the dark and you just get a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything correctly , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the following pre @-@ set window ordering : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the existing symbols of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation so that you can get an appropriate idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will need to use these menus and symbols often , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , first you need to remove all objects from the object tree . then select the scene and then select the Edit Del@@ ete menu item . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
the wire model view shows how the camera sees the whole scene you create . in particular note that in the fourth wire model view ( right below ) . this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray , you will find further details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is reserved for later instructions , but note that the camera has control points with which you can change the target of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired location . &quot;
&quot; when you press the user button or the input button , the wire model views and the object tree immediately change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a fa@@ der ( insert final body Qu@@ ader ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a cum@@ ber@@ some method for solving this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually offers a simpler option . you can use an infinite layer as ground :
&quot; a good advice : select the level in the object tree , change the name and then press the user button or the input button . in the object tree , the new name is immediately displayed . &quot;
&quot; the wi@@ re@@ model view now also shows the level , even at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . when you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; when you look at the object tree , you will find that you can open the item for the floor if you click on the symbol + in front of the object . in this case , you will only find the standard options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and shifting . &quot;
&quot; in this scene you should move the floor to the practice a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . choose shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but choose something in the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog where you can select how the object is to be inserted . please select First Sub@@ jects . the pigment is then displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pig@@ ments ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view , you can see how the pigment looks now . &quot;
&quot; of course , the Pig@@ ment Pre@@ view shows only a matte black material because you can still have settings for the pigment . so keep in mind that you can preview the look of materials at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see a color on the header and the ball in the preview , click on the App@@ ly button and then call the Pre@@ view button . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you render your image now with a click on the icon , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you have to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . in the object tree you have to type two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this also more frequently , but the chess board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
&quot; in the object tree , select one color each time and change the colors in the view of the properties : &quot;
you should already be able to do this step since you have already understood the basic method of working of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the sphere is just as easy as the ground :
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can instantly change the settings . set the value for the radius : to 1 ( do not forget the input button or push the user ) , so the ball would float above the ground , as you moved the floor to a unit down@@ wards . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering now a strange result : as you can see before , the ball surface appears like a matte black material . put a suitable material in the following step . &quot;
&quot; when you selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as at the bottom , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; select First Sub@@ jects and change the name , for example , in sphere Pig@@ ment . click on the Pig@@ ment , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; but you can achieve more interesting effects , if you take the time to adjust some finish features : &quot;
then change the values as shown in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already result in some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chrome surfaces , even if metal : not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling gives you . hopefully , you have learned so much that you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a render method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three dimensional scene or a model .
&quot; if you ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ing a scene , the ren@@ derer shoots hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . the render calcul@@ ates how this beam is reflected and broken through the objects , and how atmospheric effects such as fog will affect . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you view the scene . without a light source you also don &apos;t see anything , the image is simply black . obviously , every scene that needs to be rendered is a few light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
opens a file . in the default file dialog you can select a file that you previously created with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since last storage will be dis@@ car@@ ded .
this menu entry can only be selected if you have not previously saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . you can only select this menu item when you have edited undo .
saves the current window configuration and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing layout .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; here , you can change the appearance , the short@@ cut and the default behavior . &quot;
opens a dialog to change the keyboard short@@ cuts . you can change or add new commands with this option .
open a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool@@ bars for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling tools with this option .
&quot; a plat@@ former map is a way to imagine rough surfaces , without having to model any diff@@ ra@@ ction on the surface individually and without changing the geometric shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for both a dump map as well as a texture map .
&quot; basic elements are simple geometric shapes , which you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are made of dozens or even hundreds of these base bodies . these models are then processed further to give them a more realistic appearance . &quot;
a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis by applying a picture file as a color card .
&quot; &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , where you can select images to display . &quot;
images can either be displayed in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ball @-@ show ; is very easy . the file browser lists files that you can click with Click &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the Return key .
&quot; you can set whether each image should be displayed in your own window , or if all images are always to use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first character of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the bottom right corner . if a matching fil@@ en@@ ame has been found , the file will be highlighted . you can exit the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in three of them , General and editing and slide show , you can set the mode of work of &amp; ball @-@ show ; set . in the two other , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , you can set the short@@ cuts for the respective window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not big enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display area is filled with the background color that you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loads &amp; ball @-@ show ; already the next image in the folder , while you are still looking at the current picture . this reduces the delay when you select the next image , and is particularly suitable for a slide show . &quot;
&quot; with this option stores &amp; ball @-@ show ; when you exit the name of the last opened folder . at the next start , open &amp; ball @-@ show ; this folder in the browser window . &quot;
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can set up &amp; co @-@ show ; so set up that only some of the file types are displayed that can display the program as well .
this option increases the display window to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default .
specify whether the slideshow should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . the default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slide show will be repeated until it is canc@@ eled by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows to the right of the input field . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the different modes of operation of &amp; ball @-@ show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the file system ( a window for the sub@@ folder and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large symbols for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
displays thumb@@ nails for the files in the folder . this display is only possible in the short presentation .
the image is reduced by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
includes the display window for the pictures . &amp; ku@@ ick@@ show ; is also closed when no browser window is open .
display the image in original size . this is only useful when automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; photo editing based on the digi@@ cam ; picture editing . &amp; show@@ photo ; part of the digi@@ cam ; project .
show photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ photo ; an open source project . this means it depends on the user to make part of it , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and wishes . &quot;
&quot; show photo ; is a project supported by a community . that means that users and developers are helping each other . if you are a frequent user of the show photo ; if you are a frequent user of a show@@ shot , then we would like to ask you questions to other users of the show photo ; however , in this mailing list English is spoken , you should be powerful in this language . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in the show photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . instructions for joining the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot;
&quot; the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these , by clicking on the icons of the left @-@ hand side . &quot;
&quot; in the exposure indicators area , you can select the color shown when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should display colours with what you want to display . under@@ exposure should indicate a bright colour and over@@ exposure a dark colour . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the show photo , features a side bar at the right edge that provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same side bar in the image processing . you can view it by clicking on one of the five riders : &quot;
&quot; &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is an application to scan images , which no longer powers images to scan and save . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; is a simple application to scan and save images , which no longer does as images to scan and save images . &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for saving any image or save the images instantly in a specified folder with automatically generated name and format . the user can also display the images before saving . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner at the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a default scanner can be set at the command line of &amp; output ; if this scanner cannot be opened , or if no standard scanner is specified , a dialog for selecting the scanner will be opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to be used and press OK to open the scanner . cancel the scanner and exit .
other settings contain more detailed driver &apos;s options . ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not treat these options .
&quot; to scan a picture , the user can only start a preview scan and then scan the scan area for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; in order to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . &quot;
&quot; if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; when saving a preview in the settings selected , then the image will be displayed in a preview window as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and will you get back to the main window . &quot;
the Settings button opens the same name for the same name in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here .
&quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option Before saving a preview must be selected . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be selected . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the type like &amp; output . dialog for saving each image opens the dialog before any scann@@ ed image . if &amp; output ; this will automatically save with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you need to select Save without searching for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are saved in the Save option without searching for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are saved after each scan , then this folder is used as default for the Save dialog . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines an image pre@@ fix for the images to be stored automatically , and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix that is uploaded every time a picture is saved . the string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if you don &apos;t select the image quality , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
&quot; the button &quot; &quot; Help &quot; &quot; starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button On Beg@@ ins the K@@ DE About -@@ Di@@ alogue for &amp; Chann@@ l@@ ite ; . the button Settings displays the dialog for settings and closing can be used to finish &amp; output . &quot;
&quot; it is licensed under the GP@@ L and the lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; chant , under L@@ GP@@ L . caution : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception . &quot;
you can set up a list of this short@@ cut and their function below . the global short@@ cuts can set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window and selecting Global Keyboard Sh@@ ort@@ cuts ... Select by right @-@ clicking on the player window and choosing short commands ... Select .
you may set up existing multimedia keys so that they function as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; short commands . this makes your keyboard to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that can mostly be found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context @-@ browser , player , playlist , playlist browsers and scripts . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally , Amar@@ ok has some own command line options . &quot;
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency . please check in your script , if all required modules are available and use k@@ dialog for the user to know why a script does not run . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Kor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ deb@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos; k@@ dialog --@@ sorry &apos; # { error } &apos; exit
&quot; in the scripts / templates folder , you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use it as a base for your own scripts or simply extend it to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple . &quot;
with the help of D@@ CO@@ P your scripts can share data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command ; each K@@ DE installation should be included .
most scrip@@ ting languages allow ex@@ ec ( ) to run external programs and commands . in this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends messages to all running scripts . for this purpose strings are written to the default input of the script . for this reason , scripts should constantly monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if it has no use . &quot;
&quot; configure Wei@@ st the script to display the setup dialog . in order to save and load the setup data , each script itself needs to take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok places the work folder on the folder where all data should be saved . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ ck@@ Change signals that a new piece is played . now , the script could ask for more information about the new piece with D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example , metadata or unit length ) . &quot;
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ Volume sign@@ alizes a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er value between 0 and 100 .
custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected playlist files when a user @-@ defined menu item is cli@@ cked . sub@@ menu and it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le are also given so that the script can be added to d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le ) .
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; termin@@ ates , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . this signal should be processed in order to do , for example , storing data or configuration settings . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . such packages are basically normal T@@ ar archives ( .@@ tar ) , which can optionally be compressed with b@@ zip@@ 2 ( .@@ bz@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with extrac@@ ting amar@@ o@@ script . for this reason , you should design@@ ate your script packages right . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the remaining modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to get the file rights : &quot;
&quot; when your script package is ready , you can attach it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the wi@@ ki scripts side by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is nevertheless surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok , you can simply drag music into the playlist instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you just search for a very specific title for thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collec@@ ting Browser and Quick Search will find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; maybe you already have some play@@ lists , but you can never decide which one you want to listen to ? then the play@@ lists browser is just the right thing for you . and if your decision is still difficult , dynamic mode and smart play@@ lists will automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . moreover , many different audio systems can be used so that YOU can choose how to listen to your music . this and many other useful functions make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , you have to type the following in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; da &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no trouble while comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report these in the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that can be enabled or disabled to compile time with the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . please refer to the system requirements section for details . &quot;
&quot; activating Deb@@ u@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; without effort to set up the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several flash@@ cards to set up the different functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; in addition , if the option is switched off , only the Play@@ list window will be displayed . &quot;
use bar@@ ometer : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with m@@ ood@@ bar support . the option switches the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
atmospheric Design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled with support for m@@ ood@@ bar . this changes the used color scheme for the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; save mood files in the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; when this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files will be stored in the Settings @-@ folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ( normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external Browser : lets you choose which browser of &amp; Amar@@ ok should be started when a browser is required .
using other browsers : here you can specify the path to another browser which is not in the list above .
&quot; save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you don &apos;t want to lose the running playlist when you exit . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually stored play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; keep up @-@ to @-@ the @-@ minute play when changing the play , that the play@@ lists window will open / un@@ roll to keep the current piece in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing the context browser , it automatically displays the context browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
&quot; in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance Section , you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s appearance . the section is divided into three parts . &quot;
&quot; in the font section , you can set the use of different fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; set . by selecting your own fonts , the otherwise gray shown section will be activated . you can select fonts for the following area : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context browsers . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . for this purpose , use the selected color selection for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; resume playback will cause &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume playback automatically with the piece at the point , with which it has been stopped at the last stop . &quot;
&quot; the on @-@ screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . if on @-@ screen display is checked , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box shadow causes the text to be sh@@ aded in the O@@ SD .
&quot; use your own colors gives you the opportunity to adjust the O@@ SD colors for writing and background . a click on the color areas opens the dialog for color selection . if the colors are not activated , the pres@@ et &amp; caps are used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering space holders , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
&quot; the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users , so you can specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear . &quot;
the flash@@ card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down box . some drivers activate further settings in this card card .
the card collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and type of database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , select &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , select the check box next to its name . &quot;
search sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the ti@@ cked and their sub@@ folders are searched for music .
&quot; monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders to changes ( e.g. if music files are added or deleted ) , and an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
import play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists added to your collection ( .@@ pl@@ - and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists then appear later in the playlist browser .
the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field Driver : lets you choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected is further set up in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window .
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used for setting up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Calcul@@ ator : will the host enter , on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . then , under port : the network port is entered , under which the database is accessible . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use username : and password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the last@@ .@@ f@@ m card is designed to support last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m @-@ server and create music recommendations for the current piece if necessary .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send un@@ finished pieces and thus update the profile : this setting makes it possible &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to transmit the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
&quot; access the list in the context browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile , to be able to use this function . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( like &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . for more information , see the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok only needs k@@ deli@@ bs package and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs installed ( including the programs included , because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . &quot;
&quot; some functions such as the O@@ SD assumes that your window manager considers the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ es@@ escal@@ top@@ .org . so Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will provide for example trouble . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because these provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log . please report this error to the tag@@ li@@ b developers under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org and also attach the broken file that caused the crash . after that you can delete the file and create the collection again .
usually this is because tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this bug to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; if you are using MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for this in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of the libraries used by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used libraries with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , this leads to crashes when editing the met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . disable when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens in case of a crash ) . if it is a common crash and send us a good back@@ trace , the error will be fixed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 into the Met@@ a information , but not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l the &quot; &quot; file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; use MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; print &quot; &quot; Error in writing the tags of $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; \ &quot; &quot; unless $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed with this command : Perl @-@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well @-@ known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are simply forgotten . &quot;
if you get this error : amar@@ o@@ app : icon look@@ up error : amar@@ ok@@ app : un@@ defined icon : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System@@ Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ Pix@@ map@@ ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ pix@@ map then check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . this can be seen with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ o@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this bug , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the right version first . &quot;
there are some possibilities . most installation problems are most easily resolved by the help of an expert on your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
bu@@ g@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please enter only one error if you have something to fix a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only a blank playlist will appear . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is easy . use the file browser on the left and open the desired folder . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to keep the surface intuitive , the Start sub@@ window has been converted to the Statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars are for the assessment by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
&quot; to evaluate pieces , the playlist must be displayed in the playlist . click the title bar of the playlist and select column . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then press Del on your keyboard . or click with the right mouse button on your selection and then select from playlist remove from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
drag a playlist file with the mouse into the playlist and let them fall there just as you would do with other files . that &apos;s that simple : - )
&quot; in the playlist of the playlist , next to the Add button , the Play@@ list button is saved . click on it . &quot;
probably you lack the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config program . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ visual again . this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations .
&quot; the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( via the right mouse button ) . besides , you can find it via the menu bar under Extras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses one of the back@@ end independent approach , so the real question must be loud which media types support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you can see , we support pretty much every audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; it can ! you may use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux with which no MP3 files are included in the default ( for patent reasons ) . the solution : Alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat &apos;s mp3 @-@ de , input button &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST Online update and install the &apos; Multimedia Option Pack 1 &apos; . so ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device has to provide a bl@@ ender . a mixer allows multiple applications to use the device at the same time and to output audio simultaneously . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or by the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software bl@@ ender ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you in the search for the cause of the problem and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify another s@@ ink ( e.g. sink ) . &quot;
&quot; do &amp; Amar@@ ok ; already . don &apos;t forget that media must first be deco@@ ded . you can &apos;t just send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would only hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes them and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes your data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can output directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Centre Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound servers with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of the sound buffer ( warning , see next point of the FAQ ! ) . &quot;
with K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x there are problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed reproduction . read this bug report . the magni@@ fying of the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA installation file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either you don &apos;t use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been greatly optimized for analy@@ zers ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but when I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes and Amar@@ ok ; why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all the components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if this does not help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( quit Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Download ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then delete all ff@@ m@@ peg files ( you will find the module folder with ht@@ t@@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and run it . start &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
&quot; please report it under bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a full list of suggestions / requests , please send it to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very much and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magical K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm run with this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playback . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will be awak@@ ened by the soft tones of the music you stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to find the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a working SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running piece : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user @-@ user name Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this requires your identification in the ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA file .
the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok . press on the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer opens in an independent window in the size changeable window .
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button sets a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the input button after searching in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the Control bar ? &quot;
&quot; on the title of a browser , click on the title of a browser . in the context menu , you can select which browser to display . &quot;
my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is located on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok the collection database cannot be created and many error messages appear on the console .
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you have to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; for normal reading , switch to the wa@@ v file , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a Kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , instead , take files from folders mp3 or o@@ gg instead . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ Str@@ ing@@ List values = query ( Q@@ String ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; basically this fits the previous assessment with a dimin@@ ishing value based on how often the piece was played . the more the play was played , the less influence each individual rating has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the rating for a piece by clicking on a column header in the Play@@ list window . then , you can change the rating of a piece as well as all other attributes , namely by clicking with the right mouse button on the piece and editing : review rating or press F@@ 2 . you can also edit the review in the metadata dialog . &quot;
the developers do not want you to specify when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that does not match the short @-@ term plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new function in Amar@@ ok which some users can find annoying . des@@ elect the option symbol when playing in the general settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select settings tool@@ bars to set up ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser design , click on New Design .... &quot;
&quot; the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) , so it was removed . &quot;
&quot; Kon@@ quer@@ or Navigation area allows you to browse and control &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the Kon@@ quer@@ or . start Con@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then , click the Settings button ( the top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the drop @-@ down menu ; &quot;
the service is free of charge and you only need a free username and password . audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ; supported .
&quot; if you want to use AL@@ SA , please use the latest available version . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore also a lot of error reports . &quot;
probably was &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ installed but the output modules still do not appear . and now ?
&quot; you have to install the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ de@@ vel package . the same goes for x@@ ine , you need to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . after that you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I receive the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;s no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer has been compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without a P@@ rel@@ inking . &quot;
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must also be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad module is not installed . install the module and run it as a system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound@@ card and use AL@@ SA . how can I use the second sound card with Amar@@ ok ?
set in Settings Amar@@ ok ... audio output enter the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example for ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } ct@@ l@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in the setup dialog of x@@ ine now , enter us@@ b @-@ audio and output takes place on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of conversion of sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check@@ box on the sound card . &quot;
&quot; we are sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not taken care of . you can of course take this problem into your hand ! if you want , you can become the new urgently needed care provider for arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listen to music should be easy ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard which is displayed at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you don &apos;t like your collection later , or simply do not like the wizard , then this quick start guide will help you . with your help you will have set up &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in a few minutes . &quot;
&quot; creating a playlist is very simple . drag and drop entries from the collection browser to the playlist . if you are happy with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the playlist of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if you have your own play@@ lists , you can add this to the playlist browser . if the playlist is included in the folder of your collection , and you have the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . it opens a file browser with multiple folders and CD pieces in WAV format . simply drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the Play button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function is also available in the playlist . just click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the burning menu . you have several options for burning a CD .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . furthermore , some additional packages are listed that make working with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( such as RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a versatile multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player also has &amp; Amar@@ ok ; however , a playlist that is superior to everyone else . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok are used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one @-@ click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window , there is a running text display showing the current current piece or current stream . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , even under the running text display . you can switch through the available Analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the area . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer is displayed in an independent , magni@@ able window . &quot;
the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also displayed below the PL and E@@ Q buttons . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window while the E@@ Q button is used for the E@@ quali@@ zer .
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of the playback buttons , the volume control and the piece @-@ position sli@@ ders . use the slider to adjust the play position or adjust the volume . &quot;
&quot; the use of the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drives . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
to display the equ@@ ali@@ zer use extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation .
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most advanced playlist for all multimedia players . it has many features that it does not exist in any other player , but don &apos;t let the wealth of functions deter them , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; the playlist window can be divided into two main areas , on the left side of the navigation pane . in the navigation pane you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context browser displays different information about each running piece . the context browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and artist . these three sub@@ windows will later be explained in detail . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok , you might notice that the sub@@ window will be dropped . the information displayed there is now available in other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in addition , the information can be collected in the statistics window ( Extras Statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the performer and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first part in this sub @-@ window displays information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , the artist and the album . below you can see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . click on this icon to see the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
you will find more information about the current piece under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z icon . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; to display cover images in the context browser , the cover images must be in the same folder as the current piece . file formats .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ j@@ peg , .@@ gi@@ f and .@@ pn@@ g are supported . the context @-@ browser will also display cover images that are either downloaded with the cover administration or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the Recommen@@ ded pieces are the favorite pieces of this interpreter . this section shows the five highest @-@ rated pieces of the current interpreter .
you can set which information to display in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub@@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , Album of the Artist , lists all the albums of the current interpreter you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be up and you see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all pieces in the individual areas to start playing right away . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist .
&quot; in the text sub@@ window , the downloaded lyrics are displayed for the current piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download text from other web pages with the help of scripts . once you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you don &apos;t run any text script , you can choose which should be started . &quot;
the Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s collection database . there is no running text script required .
the Search button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com according to the song text for the current piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t - grouped just the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are ignored . &quot;
&quot; group@@ ing Interpre@@ t / Album - First the pieces are arranged by the artist and there will be another split after the respective album . if you want to see combinations or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under different performers . &quot;
&quot; group Interpre@@ t / year - Album - Sor@@ ted by artist and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the newest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is used . &quot;
group@@ ing Album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing Genre / Interpre@@ t - your pieces are displayed first by genre and among them by performer .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / artist / album - This setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the interpreter . &quot;
&quot; with the help of the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically capture your collection once you change anything to the selected folder . if you own many pieces , this could take a while . &quot;
directly under the tool@@ bar is a search filter . it beha@@ ves equally in the list view as well as in the tree view . you can find information about using this filter in the section on the playlist in this manual .
&quot; the search filter is a selection box that allows you to filter the most recently added pieces to your collection , starting from the last 24 hours to a year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will get the following options . &quot;
load - This emp@@ ties the current playlist and adds the selected pieces in the currently valid order in playback .
attach to Play@@ list - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you will get the same effect .
set up pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will play you next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name under which the list should be saved .
&quot; to transfer the pieces to the media player , add the pieces to the media player . see the section on the Media Player Browser for more details . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / burn to CD - Therefore the selected pieces are sent to K@@ 3@@ b and fired either as data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) move files into the bin ... Open a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; marking as a compilation - Select the selected album as a compilation , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears under Vari@@ ous interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; up@@ lift the compilation @-@ mark - Change a record marked as a compilation back into a normal album . after that , the album will no longer be shown under different interpre@@ ters but again under the accompanying interpreter . &quot;
&quot; the Play@@ list Browser makes it easy to handle many play@@ lists . among other things , it also contains intelligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the Play@@ list Browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with pieces in your collection that have never been played yet .
&quot; also created Intel@@ ligent Play@@ lists are possible . click the Intel@@ ligent Play@@ list to open the dialog to create a new Smart playlist , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub @-@ window is used for connecting &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to be able to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod it must be included in / m@@ nt / i@@ pod . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and let them fall on the list interpreter . if you &apos;re done , click App@@ ly . this will put the pieces on your iPod uploaded . when the transmission is finished , quit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and solve the drive connection for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar there is a search area with which you can search for a file . search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser there is a address bar with which you can fetch music from a given URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musik@@ .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press input button , you can access music in the file music .@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z . now you can drag and drop the music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , it can be difficult to attach files by simply dropping it . in this case , the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful : in this case , drop @-@ down files will be inserted automatically at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries using the mouse to the desired location . as soon as you enter letters , only the pieces that contain the letters are displayed . to reset the filter , press the back button until the text field is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter by whit@@ esp@@ ace del@@ im@@ ited search terms , &amp; Amar@@ ok will search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one of two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces are found , which contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries that contain whit@@ esp@@ ace , then change the search term with go@@ ose @-@ feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will be searched for entries that include Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries such as Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; for example , comment : &gt; 50@@ . this is looking for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a specific search term , set a minus sign in front of the search term : -@@ something looks for pieces that do not contain something . &quot;
for example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 comment : bathroom . this is looking for all pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not contain the comment bath .
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then clicking the right button in the desired order on entries . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar &apos;s tool@@ bar is located at the bottom of the window . it contains buttons for some of the features of the playlist . on the left , you will find the Add button that you can add to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , magni@@ fiable analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with one click of the right mouse button on the Analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as the one that you can view in the player window over the right mouse button . you can set up &amp; Amar@@ ok &apos;s configuration via this menu .
&quot; there are many other buttons available for the tool@@ bar , such as the playback controls and volume control . you can set up the displayed buttons by clicking on the menu and setting up tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the status bar gives you a quick overview of the useful information about the playlist . it displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval can be changed simply by double clicking the corresponding display area with the mouse . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the Status bar option in the General settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be accessed by clicking with the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking on the menu in the playlist . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the window visu@@ alisation plug @-@ ins . there you can select the visu@@ aliz@@ ations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; select .
behind this entry there is a sub@@ menu with links to this document and other information about &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start it by selecting actions cover administration in the collection browser .
the cover administration contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of a performer in your collection by selecting the performer on the left .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your big move in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queue , the playlist will appear next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the play in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue administration . &quot;
there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists from which two are already pre@@ defined ( the details to set up these later ) .
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces while playing .
adds pieces based on load .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly called Audi@@ os@@ c@@ robat ) . this mode requires that you already find some pieces in your playlist . you don &apos;t need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
&quot; double click on the playlist you want , drag them to the play@@ lists window or right @-@ click on them and then select Lo@@ ad . in this way , your current playlist is replaced by the new playlist . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes of random mix and playlist mix immediately fill your playlist and you can add the playback directly . the recommended pieces are added with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece yourself from your collection , so your playlist will be added at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic mode . this will use your existing playlist as the starting point . &quot;
&quot; the New button completes the current playlist , and adds new pieces to the dynamic mode . edit the playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist and you can change the appropriate settings . &quot;
&quot; by right @-@ clicking on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . then , the dialog opens to edit the settings of the playlist . &quot;
&quot; enter here any name for the playlist . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continuously grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ski@@ pped and they will not hear a piece in this playlist . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of pieces that are played at the beginning of the playlist , so you can easily see which pieces have been played recently . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that should be added to the playlist after each play . if you set more than one here , then the playlist will grow continuously , because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog , you can select from existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you click multiple play@@ lists , &amp; Amar@@ ok will add random pieces from each of the selected play@@ lists . &quot;
some scripts make your own settings . you can customize the settings by starting the script and then click on Set@@ ting .
you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; install scripts by clicking on the script . a selection dialog will open in which a script package can be installed to install . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . you can also fetch new scripts directly from the Internet . use the More Scrip@@ ts button .
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to use a script for longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to delete , then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information about writing your own scripts , please see the writing of scripts . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window &quot; &quot; Visu@@ alization Plugins &quot; &quot; is used to activate the available visu@@ al@@ isations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plugin , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start is intended to show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog window where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 s or other los@@ sy compressed file formats , remember that you will receive a worse quality when you add to MP3 , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD was created by a los@@ sy format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can do nothing . please wait until the computer has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start is intended to show you how to copy a data CD in just four steps . to understand the steps , you must have an exec@@ utable installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please select Extras , CD Copy ... from the menu . you can now see a dialog with possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you &apos;ve done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; settings , press the Start button . you can now see a dialog that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the copy process . as soon as reading the original into the image file is complete , you will be asked for an empty CD medium to burn the data . &quot;
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; Bur@@ ns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
&amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; Bur@@ ns the image file . you must wait until the total progress has reached 100 % .
the Q@@ T Designer tool U@@ IC can &apos;t find the &amp; k@@ de ; Wid@@ get modules can &apos;t be found . to fix this problem start q@@ t@@ config and add $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS / li@@ b / K@@ DE@@ 3 / plu@@ gins to the search path for libraries ( replace $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS through your base folder of &amp; k@@ de ; ) .
&quot; the website of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; can be found at www.@@ k@@ 3@@ b.@@ org , where you get the latest version of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; you can also get feedback on community help from the forums and learn about news . &quot;
if you want to use &amp; k@@ 3@@ b you need at least &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 and &amp; Q@@ t ; 3.1 .
&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program burns audio or data CD @-@ ins in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burning all types of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all the functions that also offers &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; therefore sel@@ ects &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , higher quality with burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program to read digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open source free and professional technology for audio encoding and for handling audio data streams . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and stands in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by the O@@ gg Vor@@ bis decoder and enco@@ der modules .
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high @-@ quality MPEG @-@ Audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well @-@ developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 @-@ enco@@ der module .
&quot; FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module , so you can read and write FLA@@ C files . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : further libraries for processing different audio formats . for example , it is possible to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them on an audio CD . &quot;
SO@@ X : an utility that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video editing . you need it if you want to read out a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ ma@@ ger : a fully equipped auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analyzing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard level . this can , for example , make sense to create mixed CDs and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the un@@ attractive effect that the music pieces are reproduced differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to start from CD and automatically re@@ play all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient way to re@@ charge recently opened projects . the corresponding sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on an entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s Di@@ alogue Save As will be shown to select folders and fil@@ en@@ ames for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as if you would call for each individual project file saving .
&quot; if a project has been modified and not saved yet , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then disc@@ ard between saving and changes . furthermore , you can cancel the closing and keep the project so open . &quot;
&quot; includes all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for any project that is not saved , as if you were called for each project file . &quot;
closes all opened projects and ended &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project is asked what to do with it as if you called a file close .
&quot; when you visit this entry , you can select from the dialog files to add to the project . this has the same effect as if you drag the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the so added files will appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; this dialog is basically the same as the project &apos;s properties dialog . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to burn the medium . the burning dialog can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; open the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is the ? help described ( available via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; files from a previous session to be imported into the current project . it is useful for you to see files for a multi @-@ session CD . it is intended for you rather than help so you can see the files and folders already available on the medium .
this record only appears on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; to remove imported files from the current project .
&quot; this also allows you to create a copy of a CD which you can burn later on . alternatively , you can also create only one copy of a CD which you would like to burn at some point later . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; the copying of a DVD with the help of copying dialo@@ gs is not yet supported , so the target medium must be large enough to capture the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in the original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog to format a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , which will delete the contents completely . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the writing modes and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a data source that can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are currently not supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ R@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; the dialog asks you for a * .@@ iso file as a data source , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog window usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used anywhere . it contains information about the full video , encoding settings , and even ways to change size and cut black edges . &quot;
&quot; displays information about the inserted medium . this information is displayed in the content view and contains properties of the medium , such as size and title length of the CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . if an entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar will be displayed at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the content view is enabled , their content is displayed in the content view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as media info , locking and unlock the drive or ej@@ ection of the medium . &quot;
&quot; the Content View allows selecting and dra@@ gging files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive is selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the head@@ line is a narrow range , which is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the head@@ line does not have any real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box to modify the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . after selecting one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignment at the bottom . &quot;
&quot; this starts the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions to burn CDs and DVDs . therefore , you need to enter the system administrator rights , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when starting the wizard . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general program settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work first . this dialog is meant to person@@ alize and fine @-@ adjust the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; k@@ de ; applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions , you can use either the d@@ co@@ p command line program or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in functionality , so your taste and type of task are critical about which of the two programs you specify . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the d@@ co@@ p command line , you must make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; started . then type something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; in addition to the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all &amp; k@@ de ; program have in common , supports &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two more parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; provides features such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for generating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ Image ( ) void bur@@ n@@ d@@ Image ( K@@ URL ur@@ l )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then a reference to the project by using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that can only be applied to data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name ) void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String &amp; ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ String path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volum@@ e@@ ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; this makes it possible to fill a data project with files and folders from a script . for example , the following script creates a data project , multiple folders and then inserts files into the new folder : &quot;
# ! / bin / bas@@ h PRO@@ J@@ ECT = $ ( d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface cre@@ ate@@ Data CD@@ Project ) d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der bar / fo@@ o d@@ co@@ p $ PRO@@ J@@ ECT / home / tru@@ eg / fo@@ o / bar
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; select for &amp; c ; . with it , simply audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; data in WAV files on hard drive ) and by many enco@@ ders that encoding these WAV files ( compressed ) . currently , l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) are supported by default ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the title of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step , these WAV files ( usually one per title ) are compressed into the mp3 or O@@ GG format or also in other formats such as los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ up@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter &quot; &quot; Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer &quot; &quot; gives a small introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia to read the audio data from the CD ; . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device can handle protection , it is not possible to b@@ ypass any protected audio CD ; even not the mechanisms of copying protection . &quot;
&quot; while setup only needs to be done once ( the setup dialog can be called up so often until a suitable configuration has been found ) , the daily handling for reading a &amp; CD ; this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; convert into many formats - depending on which coding programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can collect &amp; CD ; collect information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
this is just a short list of commands of the main window . on the page Step by step example are more information as this program is used as well as screen photos with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
&quot; the C@@ DD@@ B request of the CD data is started according to the setup of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established . ) &quot;
start reading and - if a enco@@ der is configured in the encoding settings tab in the setup guide - the encoding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of available enco@@ ders , so that the selection can be read with another enco@@ der than the default . it must be noted that before the enco@@ der settings have been configured in the setup dialog . &quot;
opens the file manager so that an already selected file is selected for encoding instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code .
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of notification ( such as protocols , p@@ auses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; exit ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( such as enco@@ der , for setting the enco@@ ders ) . here , you have to go before the program can be successfully used ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ der and compression ratios and helps you choose the right encoding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is needed . besides FLA@@ C there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information by data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG likes to have a slight advantage over MP3 in audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate , differences are less important , since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is nevertheless delivered with most distri@@ butions free of charge , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + High to very high sound quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared to O@@ GG slightly deeper quality with lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music should be heard from a computer or a computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playing equipment is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices such as standard DVD players , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard disk ) or special auto stereo systems . &quot;
a short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for further parameters ) :
&apos;@@ --@@ pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et standard &apos; = This setting should usually offer most people and most music @-@ acceptable transparency , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi hi @-@ fi systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps C@@ BR , compression rate about 5.5 . always needs 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good pleasure for music of young people , portable devices and car stereo systems . but not good enough for better hi @-@ fi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be over@@ done for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; CD ; information that is entered manually or fet@@ ched through the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet , are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files . &quot;
&quot; in connection with encoding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or the help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the title to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameters of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator must be added . the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters that can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; it &apos;s what the fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that you can download / enter , so that all others can download this information instead of entering into the computer . it &apos;s worth not@@ ing that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , names of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator ) is not a lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from being wron@@ ged by the CD ; information publicly available on the CD ; more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can get hurt . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; actively use a check box ( sending an address ) . in this type of configuration , it seems , the e @-@ mail address will not be used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( This can only know the program@@ mer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; . alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) just updates of the database .
which selection program is used to save pieces from the &amp; CD ; to store in wa@@ v files on my computer ?
&quot; there are ru@@ mo@@ urs that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; see note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed if this hasn &apos;t happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to save the read wa@@ v files , the enco@@ der and thus the desired file format can be selected . at the first opening you find pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab card to set the enco@@ der . &quot;
the Ko@@ di@@ ver package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ der . more information about Ko@@ di@@ erer are in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ erer .
&quot; after installing a enco@@ der , you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; check the setup of the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , the write and reading real on it and whether c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia as well as the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
check if you do not want to read a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; check the cover of the CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with one step for step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , set up everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keywords ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; you must have c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and l@@ ame already installed on your computer . both programs should be available as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can be found , for example , with a search engine , as it is considered non @-@ free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write privileges on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something into it by quer@@ quer@@ or ) .
&quot; the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator , something that is probably done once and &quot;
&quot; the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; , which needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD . &quot;
here we determine the enco@@ der to use for compression of the music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting audio quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) .
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will most likely not change it with any reading of a &amp; CD ; change if the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
&quot; the device name is handed over to the selection program , so it can read the &amp; CD ; data / pieces . &quot;
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this is not working or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is present , a view to the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the input of the device descriptions for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
the card General Settings . here there is not much to do . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example everything is left as laid / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; only in case of incomplete information , please select , so that you will be informed if information about generating keywords ( tags ) is missing . &quot;
the card card CD ; Settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b machine .
note : the computer must be connected to the internet while reading the &amp; CD so that it can access the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector is simpler , if a &amp; CD is found , immediately the reading of the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the resulting directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , dem &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ alog . &quot;
&quot; apart from this example , please note : if you want to manually enter the database , disable the selection fields and fre@@ ed@@ b will not be used . however , this is more than 6@@ 20 MB , consider this twice if this is worth it . to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two selection boxes need to be selected , at least the first . &quot;
&quot; C@@ DD@@ B is fre@@ ed@@ b for us . these are settings for the data request , for calling the &amp; CD ; information from fre@@ ed@@ b server over the Internet . how does the system know which data to get the CD ? read the fre@@ ed@@ b section . put everything as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
&quot; mode : we haven &apos;t downloaded the database , we just want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; C@@ DD@@ B server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org page and look for a mirror server nearby . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work first . &quot;
&quot; both work equivalent to the server , as many fire@@ walls load the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there may be more luck with the protocol 80 because the &amp; HTTP protocol is usually open to surf the Internet . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we do not want to transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activate the first check box should suff@@ ice . &quot;
just take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure that the / tmp directory exists on your computer )
&quot; at the same time , there is a reason why more than one at the same time exists only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so just try it yourself . &quot;
&quot; CD ; after reading the last piece , check this to check the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process . &quot;
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must be specified in the path / folder where the wa@@ v files are stored . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something needs to be strai@@ gh@@ tened to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as already mentioned before , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting compression factor is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for restric@@ ting the creation of tags to version V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags may also be deleted if necessary . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
put the rest as in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
number of simultaneous enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a dual core or quad@@ core or even a multi @-@ processor machine can be tried to en@@ code more than one WAV file simultaneously .
&quot; this is it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as a standard for each reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have chosen the organizational structure of your music wis@@ ely , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; to the hard drive runs . we will create a connection to the Internet , since we are comfortable and want the CD ; data from the fre@@ ed@@ b will need to pick up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read @-@ out &amp; CD ; to be repeated . &quot;
&quot; since we use a &amp; CD , which is not yet contained in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look a little different from the data collected for a &amp; CD ; therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; to manually enter data instead of retri@@ eving it from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; this example can be found . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; edition of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this isn &apos;t done yet , the &amp; CD must now be inserted into the drive that has been defined in the main window . &quot;
after a short moment the pieces and their length should be listed in the window as shown in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; as audio CD ; could be identified and can be read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia .
&quot; if this does not happen , please refer to the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section of the Help section or go back to the previous section regarding the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD has been successfully picked up by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all songs are already filled in and the name of the artist and the album is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; gives a window , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best to your &amp; CD ; fits . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for the automatic request of fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you don &apos;t have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 Step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - input of the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer has to be entered in the input field &apos; Ac@@ tual Tit@@ le &apos; , unless you have a compilation with various artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that apply together for all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful retri@@ eval of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist and album name ( e.g. whether all words are starting with upper@@ case letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and on only 28 characters for the commentary area . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you have unlimited field lengths , at least on what &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; maximum allowed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the created files later at any time using the Tag Editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also create ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all enco@@ ders or file formats . see the help of the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org website and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p , for example , are found under Rock . &quot;
after choosing &apos; OK &apos; you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece .
&quot; the window of the CD editor will appear again and you can see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the field of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all the title data of the &amp; CD ;
attention : this window does not appear when you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album are displayed above the play list .
&quot; note that it has a check mark before each line of a piece . only the titles marked in this way are read out . a simple click on the line switches off the selection of the piece , or press the All pieces button at the bottom of the screen to select all pieces at once . &quot;
&quot; by clicking on the Select button selecting the selection process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; click on the tab jobs to switch to the order window . it is in the left upper half of the window , directly below the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is currently read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left lower part of the window in the status bar .
you can see this error if you are trying to work with a enco@@ der that you have not yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . do you have checked whether you have write access to the folder for the temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of the reading of the first piece .
&quot; the order 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : order 4 is the encoding of piece 1 into the format MP3 . so you can read and code in parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has not found any configuration settings to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes for reading and coding .
&quot; now the last song is read out while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is enco@@ ded in the queue of the enco@@ der . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will appear with a message for a short time in the upper left of the window . &quot;
&quot; for successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . or 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . most distri@@ butions already contain a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package is . if you read this , you probably have already done it ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons compiled by source files , and not intended for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help , how the program can be adapted to your needs when it is running , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that inv@@ okes many different programs has many variants of settings . best read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different flash@@ cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hi , still reading on ? even if only the help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as it should go on from this kind of empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of the program start ) or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
what is it about ? who reads this has probably already started the program . it should look something like this :
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately no email . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended as the first version for a manual . and if you read this , he has left this section and therefore agrees with this suggestion . &quot;
&quot; stran@@ gely , if you have succeeded in fet@@ ching the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you do not need these information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke real @-@ time high@@ lighting of texts also some features that others &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , so it should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver required for G@@ US cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with changing color , so it &apos;s easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphic representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag &amp; drop so that you can drag and drop any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window to k@@ mid .
supports the two existing standards to store text into MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the procedure used .
&quot; session support . if you end up while playing a song , k@@ mid will start with the same song next time . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ izer , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select Open ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the song you want . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window in the &amp; k@@ mid window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the play button in the tool@@ bar , select the entry from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece will automatically start as soon as you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( with several pieces they are added to a collection and then played together . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid ; one piece plays , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive back and forth with the controller . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slow , you can click the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and thus change the playing speed . to get back the original tempo double click on the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two tasks : when a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar looks like a pressure on the button pause or selecting the menu entry Pause in the menu item , thus interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no play is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in one piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics and again both . some pieces have no text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better : the event type is automatically determined to activate a song so you don &apos;t have to manually set up automatic text selection , but you still have the option to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to set up an event type , select the entries of text events or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the buttons 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . in this section , you will find how you can use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you can find it in the menu item under the item Organ@@ ize . click New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copy and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the one in the collection manager . &quot;
&quot; in the temporary collection , all songs that you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection . &quot;
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . consider this if you add a lot of pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it needs to be selected in the collection manager . there you can add a song with the Add button . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the setting of automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is activated , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection will be activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you need to open the collection manager , select the collection and the song you want and then click Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs are played . if you select the sequence from the sub@@ menu sequence of the menus collections , the songs are played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when adding or removing songs or selecting random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the selection list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the next song button , the entry next song from the menu item or press the arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to reverse a song back , select the button Pre@@ vious piece , the entry Pre@@ vious piece from the menu item or press the arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted . however , this does not play a role as it is not saved when leaving &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ map transl@@ ates General @-@ MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map which transforms all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano type in events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type , and thus always sound a trumpet if originally a piano should play . &quot;
&quot; if you only have one sound card , you do not need a MIDI map because all sound cards are GM @-@ compatible ( incl . A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately there are no programs to create MIDI Maps , so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file which stores all required translations for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , the prerequisite for this is that each occurrence has different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; An@@ other key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
you can see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a paragraph is reached .
please send me your map file as e @-@ mail so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can be for devices that are not general @-@ MIDI @-@ compatible .
&quot; in this section , you specify how General MIDI patches are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . the general use looks as follows : &quot;
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and also leave no line for one of the 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; the optional All@@ Key@@ s@@ To M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M . if your keyboard is not supported for example ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can take a drum ( e.g. with sound 60 ) , which sounds similar to a gun shot . &quot;
&quot; so , if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 ( def@@ enses ) , it takes about 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here is the term drum patch of the patch , where each note represents another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , Mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound is the pitch of the always same drum ( as some key@@ boards possess ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to specify how sounds are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of lines is very important , as well as their existence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define multiple Key@@ maps for each channel and each instrument . you only need to use different names in the first line .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map sounds to the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the included key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to another . for example , if you want to replace the first and second channel , simply do it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards that have the percussion on a certain channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will be used with the name name for this channel . if you use the Key@@ map option , all events will be ignored which try to change the patch on this channel . in this case , patch x will always be used . &quot;
&quot; the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can be useful , for example , to always use the perc@@ ussions patch on the perc@@ ussions channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio P@@ itch Ben@@ der events are multiplied . if a MIDI file sends a P@@ itch Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there are no dec@@ im@@ al comm@@ as . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM imag@@ ines that a keyboard , which is a pitch @-@ benefit event with the value 40@@ 96 , should play a sound higher . unfortunately , however , some key@@ boards try to play two tones up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI Settings dialog . you can find it in the menu under Settings , Point MIDI Settings &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see which sounds are played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel , there is a selection list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the knob does not light green , but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
the channel view has ( up to now ) two different views to display the played sounds . view the View menu in the View menu on channel view : settings
&quot; the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the bigger the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . so , for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics , you can slow it down . to change the tempo , use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; good , I can &apos;t force anyone to use &amp; k@@ mid ; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you can also change the individual instruments , speed &amp; etc ; you have control over everything . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid has been compiled without AW@@ E support . to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution ( for example from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all files individually . &quot;
&quot; accept , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag &amp; drop . just open the folder you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; first , enable automatic addition to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow down the playback . to restore the standard tempo you can double @-@ click the LCD .
&quot; I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI folder and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( when I play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a MIDI file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) , I only need to switch to the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; window and drag the desired file to the window of &amp; k@@ mid ; &quot;
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly without adding them to a collection , turn the automatic addition to the collection , and the new ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first you just want to play the first file . so set the automatic addition to the collection and open the A.@@ mid@@ . your temporary collection then contains exactly this a MIDI file . &quot;
then decide to play B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you very much ! when I hear these songs or see the postcard , it anim@@ ates me to program on &amp; k@@ mid ; to program . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga ( Spain ) . I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I &apos;m studying mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I &apos;m studying programming , collecting MIDI files , making music and proving sentences . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , a mistake or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an email : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard from your place of residence or a MID@@ I@@ - / kar@@ aoke file from a local group , I will count among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send me a MIDI file , you should contact me as I might already have the file . &quot;
&quot; I have written &amp; k@@ mid , written entirely in my free time and by no @-@ one gets money . I would like to stress that I can only continue to program because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or e @-@ mails ) . &quot;
Tak@@ ashi I@@ wa@@ i and Joseph H. Büh@@ ler - corrected the defect that the pitch was too high at AW@@ E cards .
&quot; thanks also to Jose L@@ us San@@ che@@ z for testing the AW@@ E support , Ign@@ acio Gar@@ cia for testing the AW@@ E support , H@@ as Pet@@ ter Bi@@ ek@@ er , O@@ la Sig@@ ur@@ dson , Marc Di@@ ef@@ en@@ bruch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Peter Gr@@ it@@ sch , Ulrich Cor@@ des and anyone who sent me a patch , an error notification or even a suppor@@ tive email . &quot;
&quot; and of course , thanks to all these excellent musicians in the net , which give us these wonderful MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke files . &quot;
&quot; in addition to this , &amp; k@@ mid can also be found on his homepage , which is located under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es / ~ r@@ lar@@ rosa / k@@ mi@@ d.@@ html . on the homepage you can follow the development , look for information and look at pictures . you will also find links to pages with other kar@@ aoke songs , &amp; etc ; &quot;
a sound card . I recommend you a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you need to compile &amp; k@@ mid ; with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can &apos;t listen to music . &quot;
&quot; if problems occur , contact one of the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists or send an error message directly to me . &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or phon@@ on supported formats , as well as for playback of DVD s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;
the documentation for &amp; k@@ app@@ r ; was not yet finished than &amp; k@@ de ; installed on this computer .
&quot; for additional help please check the page The K@@ DE website for new versions , or send the question to The &amp; k@@ de ; User Ma@@ iling list . &quot;
&quot; the application window is made from so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . and finally , there is a window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred connections under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the Categ@@ ory Perman@@ ent Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course , you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy level . if you like an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups will be copied to the current category and playback starts with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the categories &apos; current track &apos; , television and permanent playlist can also be changed by direct editing of the XML configuration files . of course , you can only do this if &amp; KM@@ Player ; not running . the different files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / S@@ MB / S@@ Player / apps directory can also be changed by an editor . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , select the same with playlist from the menu and select either the edit mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes are lost when the edit mode is left or another group is selected without the playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be enabled by changing the XML configuration files .. &quot;
the animation during startup and exit can be disabled by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 &apos; option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present it can be inserted easily .
it is also possible to activate another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will keep the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / ex@@ it@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . however , this would be annoying at the end animation , the user can finish the application a second time . &quot;
&quot; a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photos : &amp; lt ; body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; im@@ g dur = &quot; &quot; file : / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; &quot; fit = &quot; &quot; file : / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f &quot; &quot; fit = &quot; &quot; meet &quot; &quot; ; &amp; lt ; / / / home / K@@ oos / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; / m@@ um@@ .@@ gi@@ f ; / body@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / / etc . &quot;
&quot; there is one tab for configur@@ ing M@@ Player in the configuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; here , the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the dat@@ ast@@ ray from the network and other things can be set . &quot;
another tool for troubleshooting is the &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; button in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Player . here the output of mp@@ layer is visible .
there is no rider for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog by &amp; KM@@ Player ; everything must be configured by manual editing of ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c like setting the back@@ end per mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a &apos; flash &apos; played with the sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa module :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ Player ; it can even be added to the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; in order for the &amp; KM@@ Player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be specified as service provider for the mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog File assignments of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or &amp; KM@@ Player ; is used in a console application and searched for error messages regarding loading the browser module library . if there is no error , the back@@ end issue is to be searched inside &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to always use a given back@@ end for a particular mim@@ e type ( of course only if this has been determined ) , this must be done by manually changing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ err@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; &amp; KM@@ Player ; can be played by TV cards , either by M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before TV can be watched , the device can be configured from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure the V@@ DR ( Video Data Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ Player , the dialogue is to be used in the Settings - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ le- &gt; VD@@ R@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port . there , ports should be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for Western Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it . &quot;
&quot; since the KM@@ Player &apos;s V@@ DR support can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . therefore , the X@@ Free@@ 86 server must be able to do the following in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally by KM@@ Player for the sources different names are used . at the time of the emergence of this documentation , this is dv@@ d@@ nav@@ y , dv@@ d@@ source , external source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ d source . &quot;
is there hints how I can qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive when I play from it ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the command h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom can be executed as user root after the device is integrated . it is absolutely certain that / dev / c@@ drom can be found on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
x@@ ine will start slowly but why does each time my CPU have to be checked for their performance ?
&quot; note : the answer is over@@ taken . k@@ x@@ in@@ ep@@ layer automatically needs the last saved value , only the first time x@@ ine will check the CPU . &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed to compile &amp; check .
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to be used on the package &amp; tex@@ tra@@ live ; respectively &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project includes some already compiled packages of &amp; Ki@@ le ; for various distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; -@@ website .
&quot; this manual is for everyone - regardless of the experience with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users do not have to read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , contact via the box should be established . &quot;
&quot; if you have any questions or suggestions , please contact the Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , direct and custom access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . &quot;
to learn more about &amp; kate ; and to experience its possibilities the manual of Kate should be drawn up . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working there directly by reading the chapter works with the Editor of &amp; kate .
&quot; lat@@ ex ; is the right pron@@ unciation : La@@ y @-@ TECH . while the original &amp; tex is very difficult to use , it is also possible to use a La@@ ie ( English lay ) &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ mac@@ ros . a less demanding but more realistic explanation is that it desc@@ ends from the sur@@ name of Les@@ lie La m@@ port . &quot;
&quot; here just a good overview of &amp; lat@@ ex ; given , it is not the ultimate book about it . to be able to master properly , good books such as H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed with the command \ \ begin { document } . &quot;
the Quick Intro@@ duc@@ tory Wiz@@ ard of &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an immediate function for quick creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( Men@@ Ã ¼ ) offers several options for creating the document . there can also be some settings related to the document .
&quot; document classes : this will include the type of document to be created : article ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , book &#91; book &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , article ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , volume &#91; be@@ amer &#93; , film &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; , or user defined . &quot;
&quot; encoding : with this the encoding of the character encoding is set . modern systems increasingly use UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as default . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for proper processing of the &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) . &quot;
this list contains the most commonly used auxiliary packages for &amp; lat@@ ex ; for integration they only need to be selected in the check box .
&quot; article ( DIN ) , book ( DIN ) , report ( DIN ) , letter ( DIN ) : the document classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about it . it is just a short description of the functions and further information about this is given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers - just like other source editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the un@@ suitable ) . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic completion of the settings , when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) of &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for the input of the text ) and the corresponding line to the selection of the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set in the menu settings box ; set up ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are de@@ activated . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the lowest element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by a single mouse click . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files can be very helpful when creating a DVI file . once a DVI file is created , click &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; viewer to the corresponding line in &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source code . &quot;
&quot; a DVI file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is in addition to PDF the original output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when you use the search function , the elements of the DVI file are plu@@ cked with the editor and once cli@@ cked on an item in the DVI file . the search is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code has been cli@@ cked , the corresponding position is bound in DVI ; viewer . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , work with others is simplified .@@ tex files are simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set over project project settings . &quot;
quick installation : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( if there are no errors in the source code ) .
&quot; surveillance : in this mode , the DVI file is &quot; &quot; open &quot; &quot; and no call of &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the fast construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the editing tool@@ bar , the three large selection boxes should be found . the selection boxes have been developed for quick insertion of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick assembly of the document into parts , chapters , sections ... &quot;
&quot; the Other Fun@@ ction box is available for inser@@ ting items such as tags , notes , notes , or references . the possibilities are : &quot;
&quot; name : with this command a name for a section , a picture or other element is created . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection field possible ) .
&quot; when using quotation , a selection list with literary entries is displayed . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; files can also be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last selection box named &quot; &quot; Gr@@ Ã ¶ h@@ e &quot; &quot; is used for determining the font size . it is possible to set the font files for the main text , the base notes , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; Ki@@ le , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and setting the settings . &quot;
&quot; the brackets after the \ \ document@@ class command contain the settings for the command . the setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; sets the font files . if the font size is not specified at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the above source code is entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the volume building or the push of a button . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; performs the storage automatically .
&quot; if comp@@ iling the document is not recommended , it should be searched for errors in logging . when using fast construction , &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( engl@@ . environment ) is a text that is otherwise treated as the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font is created 12 and only a few columns should have another font . &quot;
the changes are made only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no nar@@ rowing ( number ) for changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the legi@@ bility and usability of the document . for example , there can be certain fonts , fat pressures , cur@@ sive pressure , sub@@ missions , etc . these commands end either with the command \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
\ \ begin { emp@@ h } : this command is valid for ital@@ ics and is long until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be displayed itali@@ c with \ \ up { word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . quote starts with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quote } .
&quot; after the background to write the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language was presented , a step @-@ by @-@ step guide is now followed for the creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; &quot;
&quot; as soon as the wizard has entered a bit of text , some adjustments should be made for better read@@ ability of the document . to do this , min@@ d. a quote , a few places in fat and ital@@ ics and a poem should be applied to see the differences between these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document has been viewed , Editor @-@ View or C@@ trl E can be converted back to the editor ( in the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed out or converted into a Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
DVI ; is an expensive file format ( D e V ice I n@@ dt ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for legi@@ bility of some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers ; &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF conversion or computer screens .
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps are necessary for creating the document ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can be printed with file printing ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows the conversion of the DVI ; file to other formats . once the DVI file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code , the conversion into sli@@ pped other formats can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the search function allows direct jump from the editor to the added position within the DVI file .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a corresponding setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Bin@@ h files . to do this , only Modern under Settings boxes need to set up ... tools build up . &quot;
&quot; to execute the search function , the mouse cursor has to be positioned in a line of the source code and then cli@@ cked on during search @-@ search . the jump to the corresponding position in DVI ; viewer takes place then . &quot;
with this function in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; with one click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do this &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; as text editor ( setup ey@@ epi@@ ece ... editor )
&quot; if there is no error when using fast building of the &amp; DVI ; if an error is present , this will be displayed in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file declares the source of error in the source code . in the editor , the pop@@ s of La@@ Te@@ X errors and N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ ster La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for jumps between errors . the log file always displays the line in which the error appears . to view the fla@@ wed line , the error in the logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; navig@@ ates to the correct line . &quot;
&quot; once you click on the button in the tool@@ bar button , a window will appear to select the template to be used for the document . the pres@@ et options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting empty documents , a document can either be re @-@ written or the wizard will be used to quickly create a new document . for more information , see the section . &quot;
&quot; mostly users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; usually use the same introduction for virtually all documents . templates can be created , saved and loaded to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by opening an existing document and selecting file template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a new document using file New , some strings may be replaced with other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in Settings Ki@@ le ... Set@@ ting General settings . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is necessary to know which strings of which variables are replaced : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering the document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { article } .
the easiest way to create a template is the use of the wizard and the associated input of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created this way the following steps have to be executed :
&quot; when creating a new document , you can select your own template instead of the standard version . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any and lat@@ ex ; a simple way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and the steps described below should be carried out . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; kate ; as internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the possibility of reading and selecting from many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) . many settings for posters ; can be made in the menu tools directly from &amp; Ki@@ le ;
&quot; to learn more about &amp; kate ; and to experience its possibilities , the manual of Kate should be drawn up . users from &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start editing the chapter directly with the Editor of &amp; kate . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference , which can be accessed via the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of nearly all commands that can be used in &amp; lat@@ ex , as well as their syntax . &quot;
double @-@ click with pressed C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that when clicking \ \ par of \ \ par \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with a left @-@ right mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse different types of source texts and to highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands from normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color . &quot;
&quot; many wiz@@ ards can access additional jumps . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu entries do refer to the next or final jump mark . thus , this jump stamp is highlighted so that when entering a character it is automatically deleted . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; . although &amp; kate ; already excellent opportunities offers , have been added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; provides always many environments and groups and therefore supports &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for selecting a selection . &quot;
&quot; this extended meaning includes tables , and lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source text . this extended meaning includes tables , and lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . the only explo@@ ative thing in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two empty lines . &quot;
&quot; this selection also has an extended meaning , as this command can also be extended with lat@@ ex ; -@@ commands with a drop @-@ down ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , of course , this can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Plac@@ ards ; provides the C@@ trl + K key with the whole line . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers with own commands to remove the text : &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is contained in the description to Edit select paragraph .
&quot; it has already been illustrated that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le offers ; for further orders under Edit environment for a more convenient work with lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
with this command you jump to the beginning of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command jumps to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to connect the environment .
when the cursor is before or inside the \ \ begin { environment } is spra@@ yed at the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can be lost quickly . this command will close the recently opened environment , so that the ne@@ sted surrounding structure will not be destroyed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; also offers special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups specified by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group , a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environments . &quot;
this command jumps to the beginning of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the spra@@ ying bracket .
this command jumps to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the buck@@ le closing bracket .
when the cursor is in front of or behind the shr@@ unk of a &amp; tex ; group # is spra@@ yed at the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; when entering many ne@@ sted groups par@@ enth@@ eses , the overview can be lost quickly . this command will close the recently opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the &amp; tex ; groups is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple reference marks are used as a sign . for the pur@@ pos@@ eful implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; used for two simple instructions . &quot; &quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; knows this case and has two closing arguments for &amp; lat@@ ex ; one . &quot;
this automatic entry of the double connection sign can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; there can also be ad @-@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) , so that German or French suits can be used . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; pressing Shift ; En@@ ter &amp; Ki@@ le ; an intelligent line break . if the current position is located within a list environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not only a new@@ line break but also the \ \ item command . &quot;
&quot; in a table environment , join &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an adjacent line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is smart enough to support pre @-@ set &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ; setup ... La@@ Te@@ X can be added .
&quot; some users want to assign the columns in tables -@@ environments to each other . &amp; Ki@@ le ; try to reach this . while doing Shift , Alt ; amp ; searches &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above line . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; kate ; already a good source code completion offers , this has been added to &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( mostly for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) are added . all these modes can be configured for different modes for automatic completion . all these modes can be set up for different modes of work under Settings Ki@@ le ... &quot;
&quot; when starting a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } , &amp; Ki@@ le will automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } after an empty line ( for the text ) . &quot;
&quot; when you click the button , the last letter of the input is removed and you will be able to enlarge it . on the other hand , the list can also be reduced by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . the descriptions are obviously removed when selecting a command . alternatively , you can choose from &amp; Ki@@ le ; also jump marks can be inserted , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by means of the ho@@ ck marks N@@ Ã ¤ ch@@ sten boun@@ cing brand and the desired parameters can then be inserted . &quot;
&quot; under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . it can be used to complete different file lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands , as well as entries of the general language use . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not necessary for completion of environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the inv@@ oc@@ ation mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are used so often that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing environments . &quot;
&quot; when inv@@ oc@@ ating completion mode over the menu item , or the Shift key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically added and it appears \ \ begin { . after that , the surrounding environment can be continued in the simplest way and can be terminated by pressing the input key . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment is automatically closed again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that this is a lists environment , even a first \ \ item command is added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings Ki@@ le ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; Complete settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of exec@@ uting modes for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; supports user @-@ defined lists of covers that can be replaced immediately by shorter string chains . the lists can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... The file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , for example , is included in the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; for example , if the letter L is entered and the word processor is introduced over the menu , or the C@@ trl + Alt key key , the letter L is replaced by the string \ \ La@@ Te@@ X . &quot;
&quot; large bay windows are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been found that many porters are written more than once in a document . &quot;
&quot; this mode can be set up in the menu settings box . here , too , the tres@@ hold for the display of the completion can be determined . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ utable files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / common home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics are designed to create graphics as simple as possible . to view the basics of the graphics formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as known as PDF files , but offer an excellent basis for changes and new orders from pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools and then converted into a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; to examine the result of the work , you need to compile the source code . all construction tools are grouped in groups in the menus creating comp@@ iling , converting and creating views . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer like &amp; ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or another conversion can be used by pressing Alt ; 2 . afterwards , the DVI ; file can be converted to a PS file by pressing alt ; 4 , using Alt ; 5 , the PS file can be viewed . &quot;
&quot; when using the Schnell@@ bau command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no embedded viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
a new project is asked about the project New Project .... This is where the following information is requested for the project :
&quot; when you exit the file name window , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of the EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed over scripts in the vertical bar .
&quot; the API scripts are not yet finished yet , and can be added to other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le . &quot;
&quot; first , it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; Ki@@ le ; a system @-@ wide object ( = Ki@@ le ) with the following methods : &quot;
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a well designed system , in which the basic functions can be extended by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers a lot of different help to support the users . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ tra@@ live ; are supplied with many documents . included are a documentation for the packages contained and another &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important packages are described ) , but rather a full manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is therefore ideal for searching for a specific format@@ ting . since this is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; because of the amount of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / texts is delivered , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help offers &amp; tet@@ ex ; / Tex@@ live ; the small application tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , containing a database with all available documents and a graphical surface . &quot;
&quot; all documents are divided into categories , and the main advantage is the search for package names or hits . from &amp; Ki@@ le , only the results are displayed . &quot;
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or the space bar open the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source editor that can be executed on all systems with installed &amp; c ; - and Unix @-@ like systems . &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also a part of the Fink project , which can be executed on &amp; Mac ; also on &amp; Mac ; with installed OS @-@ X . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who seek after the Fort@@ une of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project , and sacrifice for many hours for the development of tools that we can use all under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; license . &quot;

&amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . the signatures process you in the graphical user interface of &amp; k@@ sig ; . with the command line interface you create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; .
&quot; for random signatures , any signature is selected from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . by many signatures with different quotes , styles and information , you can create your e @-@ mails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily signatures the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig . for each day , use different signatures , as with the random signatures , create unique e @-@ mails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N File New . this gives you a lt ; empty signatures ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section ; in the Sig@@ natur@@ es section , add your signature . signature sample Kon@@ qi kon@@ qi @ k@@ de@@ .org ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ k@@ de@@ .org When you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S file Save or click on the disk symbol . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs like &amp; k@@ mail ; . whether you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it from the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross in the tool@@ bar . &quot;

&quot; to use one &amp; DT@@ D ; specified in the &amp; XML ; file specified , select &amp; DT@@ D ; ( Internal ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and specify the location of the &amp; DT@@ D ; file selection . for both the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema and for the Relax@@ NG check it is necessary to specify the definition UR@@ I ; in the file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL processing tool ! this uses the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; should the file to be processed in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; already selected , then let the current file be selected . if not , remove the selected file and select the file to be processed using the other file selection . &quot;
&quot; enter the name of the file , as the result should have named , and the file is usually stored in your home folder . &quot;
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , la@@ gs , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; even possibly little to do . this makes the plug @-@ in system very powerful . you can benefit from the additional functionality immediately and do not have to wait until someone uses the winning in &amp; GUI ; elements can be used . more about it below . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start using the Edit menu . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage all contained plu@@ gins and add new ones . we describe each &amp; GUI ; element in it :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a location used &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several people in a kind of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the specification of team members and they can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self @-@ explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the user &apos;s nick@@ name and is used for unique identification .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders and sub @-@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can choose from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the button . the currently selected member ( their identi@@ ties ) will be bold after you are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of their own identity are important in terms of news and ann@@ ot@@ ations . see for further information on ann@@ ot@@ ations .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can create an event for information to the team leaders when something is happening . see for further information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something particular happens in the project . an example would be to record the opening and closing of the project , so that later on how much anyone worked on it , or sending a message , when a file is backed up , or a script that plays a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the page &quot; &quot; Event Con@@ figuration &quot; &quot; of the Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see selected in the recipient list . add@@ res@@ see may be a team or sub@@ project leader . see how such conductors will be set up .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
&quot; to enter notes is simple . either the note entry can be selected from the editor context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword will be entered in a comment section followed by comment text . &quot;
&quot; notes can be sent to a certain member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the set nick@@ name of the team member , is a role in the project from the following possibilities : team leader Sub@@ project manager should be given the appropriate area or sub@@ project names , as in the following examples below . &quot;
nick@@ names and roles names are in@@ sensitive to upper or lower@@ case but spaces around the brackets and the : make the note invalid .
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages supported by DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings are accessible via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Speci@@ fic settings are treated , a short description for the others may be found in . &quot;
the settings can be set up by setting Qu@@ anta ... This dialog extends over a number of pages that are treated one after another .
the behaviour of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed . the entries are :
&quot; large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal size / lower@@ case means , the tags are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; large / lower@@ case of attributes : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal size / lower@@ case means , the attributes are inserted as they are described in the tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional Tags automatically include : if checked , for tags for which the closing tag is optional , this immediately after the &amp; gt ; inserted . &quot;
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for simple tags .
&quot; start and end day automatically update : if switched on , the corresponding tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic replacement of acc@@ ent signs : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding code during typing .
&quot; MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files . using button standard , the def@@ aults can be recovered . &quot;
default character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in a different way than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be b@@ yp@@ assed ) . this setting is em@@ itted from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded .
&quot; default DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D was not recognized . however , this setting is em@@ itted from the same in the project properties if a project is loaded . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates regular backup copies , so that in case of a power failure or crash the next start of the program the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be displayed either in the editor area or in one &apos;s own view ( or the documentation in a map ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
set the window settings back to the default when the user interface returns by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and do@@ cking / depen@@ dencies of each other . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ layout command line parameters .
the warning message area serves the control of the possibility to disable the display of warnings by hooks of no more .
&quot; the place to change the behavior of &amp; V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts , as well as synchronization behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and source code view in shared mode . &quot;
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , representing the illustration of the par@@ ser node in the document , can be adjusted in detail . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action solved by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the area of structural @-@ tree settings , the visibility of knots in the tree , the frequency of the tree during editing and how deeply the structure tree can be opened automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty areas in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for multiple &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s . this means there can be a valid group for PHP in which the i@@ f@@ clause abbrevi@@ ation means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; here you can manage the plug @-@ ins . plug @-@ ins are K@@ Part applications from third side , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , at the best @-@ known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; . when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a stand@@ alone like $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information is passed to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
load component in &quot; Only @-@ L@@ ese &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses to load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; if the entered information is correct , then select if the plugin is not available at the moment , but it should be installed later . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from version 3.3 , troubleshooting was completely re@@ developed . support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger was set , as well as support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . &quot;
&quot; currently only one plugin is available , the support for the use of &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inserts . &quot;
the use of the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project starts with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plu@@ gins in the project settings . using the Options button next to the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin Sel@@ ection field the specific settings can be changed .
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; user interface : &quot;
a view in which the contents of monitored variables are displayed . usually appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view in which all holding points , with line numbers and conditions are listed . usually appears in the lower dock . &quot;
a view in which the output ( like in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger is shown . usually appears in the lower dock .
&quot; depending on the supported features of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action makes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to de@@ bu@@ gging demands . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened using a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that in normal case it is not necessary to pay attention . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ u@@ gging session starts the session . closes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the listening to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server for a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger output view .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script and sending information on the monitored variables as well as the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will continue . if it happens before a Deb@@ u@@ gan@@ cy requirement is started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start execution of the script without having to send information to monitored variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . if it happens before a request is made , the execution begins once a request is made . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger leads the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger exec@@ utes the next instruction in the script , where it is possible to clean in functions and include . &quot;
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to move the directive and go to the next one as if there were the current ones .
opens a dialog where a variable or an expression can be entered that is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view .
with this dialog you can enter a variable or set a new value to a variable .

this chapter describes how you can adapt to your needs and how you can and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; help you become better .
&quot; document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; their simplicity and flexibility makes aus &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s exist in two ways , family 1 , the mark@@ up languages and family 2 , the script languages respectively &amp; CSS ; . &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s consist of two file types , the tag folder and tool@@ bars . tag folder contain two file types , which include &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag XML files with the extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbolic buttons of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , the text and instructions more quickly insert into a document than a user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or automatically created from an existing DT@@ D . see for details on conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how Tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
&quot; Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog , the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for the day shows . the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file contains the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags in a document without danger of a typ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and the tag XML files . tag folder bear the name of the descrip@@ tive language and version , so available . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of tag XML and declare whether they are necessary or not . although not all are necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information when working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limits is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a tag XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing but a type of tag itself . &quot;
the type of the tag is a script function . when used it is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
only valid for the day type class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
only valid for type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text in the dialog . this text is determined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is an element type element .
&quot; describes an attribute of a tag . this element can only occur once for each attribute . it contains the name and type of attribute . in addition , there are additional tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is an element type element . &quot;
gives the source code used for filling the attributes in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used to achieve the data source .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , an interface and a method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , which means the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag grouped together the elements of a list . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
defines the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can occur for each attribute in a dialog only once ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
indicates the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be available for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; label &gt; tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements that may occur within the tags to be defined . this element is an only element type .
there is a list of elements that finish one day . this element is an only element type .
all day XML files must start with an &amp; XML ; declaration : &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ch@@ ained and closed properly .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but pay attention &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; character . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; wh@@ ats@@ this &gt; , and lt ; text &gt; will not cause any leg break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
&quot; to check the Tag@@ XML files , the Tools dialog is in the top of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear whose simple instructions are to follow . &quot;
this function is currently not available . currently the check is done only when loading the tag XML files in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; .
the following is an example of a family 1 tag XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; schema &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this tag XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a working family 2 tag XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP will be described ; the file name of this tag XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&quot; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; &quot; 1.0 &quot; &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; ! Doc@@ type tags &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; &quot; over@@ load &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; function &quot; &quot; type = &quot; &quot; optional &quot; &quot; / &gt; &amp; lt ; / day &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt; &quot;
&quot; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , accessible via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . with this , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created for a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; version = turn@@ around 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for any higher version . name = DT@@ D statement . ( / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New Action leads to the same dialog :
&quot; the short@@ cut , assigned to this action . by clicking on the User defined button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ eine the current short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
&quot; the simplest actions . it can be entered a text in the detailed settings and when exec@@ uting the action , this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below . &quot;
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) that change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , even are the quick start dialog or the different see in ... actions for the ( X ) HTML D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first the name of the script and the interpreter must be specified . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in the command line like sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . This way tries &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script can be found in the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
% f : we will replace with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document file : / from the document name will be removed .
&quot; % p@@ id : will be replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus process ; if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; only one instance is running , the text will be unique to the PID number . this is useful if D@@ CO@@ P is used for controlling &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the external script . &quot;
&quot; parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods mentioned above , a script can receive input from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the input field input can be determined , which is to send to the standard input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only meaningful with this setting .
&quot; there are two types of output : normal output , written to the default output ; error messages , directed to the default output . it can be specified what happens to the text written to the default output , by setting the value of the selection field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to divide the tags in logical groups . it is necessary to create your own tool@@ bar for each group . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select settings actions . &quot;
the parts of this window are rather self @-@ explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill out all the required fields and add the tag to the right tool bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the Tag has attributes and you plan its use , activate the dialog &quot; Edit Tag &quot; when available , so that you can enter when using the action . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ itt ! is that an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it , before we have difficulty . &quot;
&quot; to create a symbol that represents the action better , we will use &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; use . select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics for more programs ( or where else it is located in its distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; used by default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol not only helps you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; in terms of starting the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually displayed as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user will be sign@@ aled that clicking on this icon will insert ; start ; tag in the current document . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol , it still needs to be connected to the action . this happens through the menu with settings actions to specify ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; ) and selecting the desired action . besides the text field is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the stored icon is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the user button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
let &apos;s assume you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; functions for the tool@@ bar or it should be split@@ ted into several groups for a better overview . open the tool@@ bar to set the tool@@ bar dialog . make sure the tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the element that is to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow key to the right . this adds the element to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the Tren@@ ner support the group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar could believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by trying all the symbols to make sure everything works .
&quot; after new e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust their tool@@ bar ( s ) when a file is opened from the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most not@@ e@@ worthy extension of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for normal users it is possible to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language you like most . therefore , this chapter describes how to create a &amp; PHP documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; - Rep@@ os@@ itory if someone has already done that for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to look for an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc / language . then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , to the documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index top element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html section 2 = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 1 = tag@@ 1.@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ 2.@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ 3.@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see now in the &amp; PHP ; documentation : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element top element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = table of content , # get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Basic syntax , ... Basic syntax = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic syn@@ tax@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is sub@@ folders in the tree with its own content . there is no known boundary for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
&quot; note that the contents directory is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and , consequently , at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder indicated ! ) . &quot;
spaces affect nothing but watch &amp; &amp; lt ; signs . these should be replaced by &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; resources will be replaced .
&quot; the section of content is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used for designing the context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP script , the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function is displayed . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( Con@@ text@@ List ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of context elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
you can now save your file do@@ cr@@ c after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc or $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( as you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation there .
&quot; if you are sure that they are good and worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , for example , which documentation was used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ community . they will not be rich , but be proud to have worked with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the failing resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by e @-@ mail to friends , partners or otherwise to whom . at different places there is a menu entry like DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) send with Email , the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with e @-@ mail , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the script tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all others &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; users can download them . the contributions are checked and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for publication . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading , you are asked for your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase for your private G@@ PG key ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event you have several keys , you can choose one . in the dialog New resource , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start up@@ loading . &quot;
&quot; up@@ loading can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar , and started in the context menu of files and folders in the template and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , before installation , examined &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the integrity of the resource by checking integrity and signing . in case of problems , it warns and it can be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages carefully . if the integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the indication of the source of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work on XML @-@ languages currently not yet supported by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the easier way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically . &quot;
the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D menu and conversion of a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description to be used . then the following dialog appears :
target Name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
Doc@@ type definition line : the string that appears in the ! doc@@ type tag like HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : when activated , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . to understand these and to get full benefits from and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , one must first famili@@ ari@@ ze themselves with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are available for everyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all that is known as global is stored in the common folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this allows the group of administrators to secure various tool@@ bars , actions and patterns in a global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
&quot; project @-@ related elements are only available within a specific project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project . simply said , this is the most limited size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project , which em@@ o@@ lig@@ ates the shared use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the tree views , the card readers with information and the tool@@ bars . please enter , and for further information on these areas . &quot;
&quot; you can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , like closing the current , other , or all flash@@ riders , rel@@ o@@ ading , del@@ eting or up@@ loading the document , jump to a book@@ marking or execution of CVS commands to the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click on the editor pane will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse poin@@ ter , or open the file if the string under the mouse poin@@ ter is called a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editor window are the tool@@ bars of the editor . currently , &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional is used as a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is shown . as part of the further expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the tool@@ bars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , for example &amp; lt ; if you want to insert into your document , then click the icon that represents the tag . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( like anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the Bau@@ man@@ views ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate in the information about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; to navigate , open and strip them . in the presentation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation of tree views . &quot;
&quot; project Management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right @-@ click . actions like adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage medium can be carried out with the then displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; another possibility of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is the use of templates . almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website &amp; etc . there are all possibilities open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories , depending on what context they are used . the category depends on the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; work area . global templates are always available , local templates only usable for the appropriate user and templates in projects are only usable in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you will find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . the concept of integration in Global , Local and Project also works here . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the information available to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document to the position of the element . by right @-@ clicking an element , a list of commands opens up in terms of navigation and refres@@ her of the tree . &quot;
this tree appears among the other tree views . it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the content @-@ oriented entry system allows changing of all available attributes with a few mouse clicks .
&quot; here is the complete documentation of the web technology for your development to find . you can download pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; from the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; &apos; documentation site , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be added , edited and viewed on project @-@ specific documentation . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two flash@@ cards at the bottom of the window , can be accessed through useful information : the message window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
&quot; this tab shows all errors in the Mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , scripts executed , give all error messages ( as there are ) in this window . &quot;
the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; tool@@ bars are extensively expanded and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they receive the corresponding command . the cho@@ col@@ ates side of the tool@@ bar is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another function of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is the ability to send a tool bar with E@@ Mail . &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; send the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive over &amp; k@@ mail ; . if you receive a tool@@ bar in an email you can save them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; like any other store and load !
&quot; it is reasonable if you want to adjust the location of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , files on your system . however , auto@@ conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , enter . / configure --@@ help . &quot;
&quot; if you have problems when starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folder . also , you should ensure that there is no older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of their bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; has been optimized for rapid web development and combines a mature development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; while trying to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ? well , this would make him an absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; k@@ de ; so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer on pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; for this the appropriate &amp; IDE . &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be held that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community is based . thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; framework not only this is possible , but it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; allows web developers to leverage an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document interface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool@@ bars , automation is almost every task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is in no way connected with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L @-@ licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more detailed documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; enter , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and managed by Eric L@@ aff@@ oon Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files that you have opened , each time you open a file that is not located , the oldest entry will be removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look into the section about templates . if they try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error is reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there contained special characters to &amp; HTML ; sp@@ elling , so that they are displayed correctly and not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting reference . &quot;
convert the text from the clip@@ board in &amp; URL ; sp@@ elling which is the correct way to insert special characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag .
turns the block selection on or off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP ; script error messages out !
searches a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a sort of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you can see the display of scripts and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
&quot; the problem re@@ porter is activated , as soon as you change to the structure tree . &quot;
&quot; displays the icons on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks , with a click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries Pre@@ vious or Next , depending on the cursor position in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the fil@@ en@@ ame of the other documents .
opens an existing project from hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presents a dialog to insert files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows , for example , to copy graphics files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project on the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; from and whether you have downloaded more input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the project administered . in the chapter &amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects you will find the details . &quot;
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; open a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this only creates the name . actions must be saved through settings actions . tool@@ bars are saved using tool@@ bar tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the disk . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar yet , you &apos;ll be asked if you want to do so . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as attachment .
&quot; allows up@@ loading of tool@@ bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
upload a &amp; DT@@ D ; which has made you or anyone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; own description format .
&quot; loading / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P should be fresh@@ ened , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the load fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags available in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool@@ bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent insertion of tags is activated or de@@ activated . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; inser@@ ting by means of a tool bar is denied when this day contradic@@ ts the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plu@@ gins are listed among the menu items mentioned above . click on it . &quot;
sel@@ ects syntax checking mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the rendering ; version .
&quot; very useful when you know people using other OS platforms to develop . select Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
&quot; checks the syntax of the current document using the selected &amp; DT@@ D , using the external application ti@@ dy . &quot;
&quot; instant switching between the different types of user interface . due to some restrictions in the K@@ DE libraries , switching sometimes may need time or un@@ nice graphics . recommended is the flash@@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which is the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu contains an entry for each open window . when selecting a entry , the appropriate sub@@ window will be activated . &quot;
enables the status bar to display at the bottom of the qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
&quot; changes in this dialog influence every application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
direc@@ ts the behavior of the editor window . in the documentation of &amp; kate you will find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or add them and change the sequences .
&quot; this should create a help in accordance with the context of the mouse poin@@ ter , but has not yet been implemented . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a high quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with every open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; development in financial form , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be completed best from top to bottom , since , for example , after filling out the project name , the whole directory structure will be automatically completed for the rest of the project . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project to enter , for example fo@@ o . when entering name , file is filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here is the machine address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ exempl@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol will be used . depending on the setting of the remote host , an adjustment might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the templates for the project are stored . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows you to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem to the project . you can select multiple files or entire folders .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content you want to download and change . for ser@@ vers@@ ed scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are located somewhere in the project &apos;s main folder , if a project is re@@ started from scratch , not hook . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder are displayed and you can make a precise selection according to good man@@ di@@ lution . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hooks or , by removing the tick , cl@@ amm@@ ers out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with project @-@ properties in the sub @-@ window profiles or modified with the Shift + F@@ 7 key .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Assistant and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of fil@@ en@@ ames ( wild@@ cards possible ) , which are re @-@ read in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , including files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore , are excluded from the project . &quot;
&quot; the project view , which is loaded when the project is opened , can be read more about project views . &quot;
this allows the desired de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the Deb@@ u@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button .
&quot; in the Profile Up@@ load window , high load profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile , by pointing an own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the sub@@ window team configuration , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration , event actions can be switched on and these actions can be added , changed or deleted . event actions are executed when a previously defined event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
&quot; by default , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus opens ; the last project that was opened . this behavior can not be affected at this time . &quot;
to open another project choose Open Project ... from the menu project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog project will open and allow the selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; closed , the project file will be saved automatically . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; changed files will find . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave as well , but the entries are missing opening and opening with ... in the context menu sel@@ ectable with the right mouse button : &quot;
here different profiles can be selected . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; allows removal of the current profile . if only a profile is present , the button is hidden to prevent the removal . &quot;
&quot; the password is kept in the core memory and forgotten by programming . this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary , and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk save option does not come into question . &quot;
this will stop the transfer or simply leave the dialogue if you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many high load profiles can be created and thus the project ( or parts of the project ) can be uploaded to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog is displayed : &quot;
this is the server name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service at the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your anxiety wave , this is either a time @-@ saving function or a danger . use it at your discretion . the password is stored on the disk , so it can not be read easily , but everyone with programming skills can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply changing the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be opened , opened or deleted from the tool@@ bar project tool@@ bar in the Project or Project Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this not only helps to increase productivity , but also allows the adaptation of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to its own working method . &quot;
as mentioned above are tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the best way to use the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar . use and addition differ . adding tool bar is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars .
&quot; the tool@@ bars and symbols can be set either by context menu ( right click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which the new action , a new tool@@ bar can be created , which can be used to remove other actions such as tool@@ bars , tool@@ bars , or tool@@ bars , which can be specified , which actions on this or other tool@@ bar should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , the entries will be removed and action is displayed , which are self @-@ explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bar and the actions on them can set up tool@@ bars in the menu with Settings ... and set settings actions to set .
&quot; templates are basically a document skel@@ eton , code sni@@ ps and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; used templates as a basic file system with advanced organization and interfaces . you can copy , move or link any directory present in the template tree . templates have in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; in instance the restrictions you are presenting to the file system . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; provided templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each submission prior to use .
&quot; binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . further information on the template tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be from any text document type . based on these templates , new documents can be created . usually , more specialized documents are created in corresponding sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organis@@ es the work in a corresponding way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area . you can find everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl basics . some examples can be found in the template tree , under global templates . see for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates are used for whole websites as templates . they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure as you wish ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File As template save As a local template ... &quot;
&quot; once this is done , note that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click File As template to save selection as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be dra@@ gged with drag and drop to the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; the creation of binary templates is simple : the file can only be copied to a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions , such as pulling and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder on the right and choose Site template , enter a name for the template and back up the template . by default it is saved in the project folder , but of course it can be saved as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates allow a very goal @-@ oriented approach . you can pre@@ fix he@@ aders and foot@@ ers or dynamically with &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . in addition , you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window templates is based on the files placed in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates / qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of container as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the master folders in the template guide . if a root folder would be set up , it would basically de@@ activate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder the b@@ lah would appear with something like text building block . if nothing appears , you probably will find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a specific project and allows you to equip a whole presentation with the matching he@@ aders / foot@@ ers by copying content templates to a folder with special he@@ aders / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( pointing to the right mouse button ) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; offers two modes : V@@ PL ; editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; source text editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source code editor by the V@@ PL ; editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source editor and the V@@ PL editor .
&quot; the V@@ PL editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page , and a cursor appears . then you can edit and rever@@ t to the source code if needed . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; editor on a document containing &amp; PHP , a small green icon shows the default of &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly with the V@@ PL editor . to edit &amp; PHP ; to edit it , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that the changes are both visible in the source text editor and the V@@ PL editor and the cursor in the source text editor and V@@ PL editor . pressing F@@ 9 , this mode is already active , pressing the active cursor from one window to another , maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchronization margin between the V@@ PL editor and the source code editor is set to set up via settings Qu@@ anta .... After selecting V@@ PL , you can select between synchronization after one click or automatically . in principle , the recommendation : a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow . &quot;
&quot; assuming that you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to select document properties . this allows editing of invisible tags at work with the V@@ PL editor . the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the V@@ PL editor . &quot;
met@@ a tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a @-@ elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons at the bottom . a click into the list allows changing the contents e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Key@@ word 2 on the content column .
CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the cursor is like in a word processor , by moving with the arrows , possible . under rare circumstances the cursor beha@@ ves stran@@ gely . the marking works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and dropping by means of a button or removing paste . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way over the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . it must be noted that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags cannot be removed , e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text , any other drop @-@ down tag must be removed . &quot;

&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the examination of style sheets . unlike other style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the style template can be followed . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; successfully comp@@ iling , need outside &amp; k@@ de ; still libraries lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt , li@@ be@@ x@@ s@@ lt and Lib@@ XML , which are present at a typical installation of &amp; k@@ de ; already available . &quot;
&quot; new in x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g 3.@@ 1.4 : in g@@ db compatibility mode , orph@@ aned post@@ ings can be set in a specific file and line number and later activated . &quot;
x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g determines the full path from a fil@@ en@@ ame with no path input . fil@@ en@@ ame in the same folder as the top loaded style file fil@@ en@@ ame with rel@@ ativ@@ ly path to the work folder con x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g Is for example a style template file .. / en / x@@ sl@@ doc@@ .x@@ s@@ l is possible :
&quot; in this command , a partial or complete agreement with a template called QNAP or a specified model name is checked . &amp; eg ; template agrees with any QNAP template containing the template template . &quot;
&quot; each nam@@ esp@@ ace in the specified &quot; &quot; QNAP &quot; &quot; is extended by the rules defined by the nam@@ esp@@ ace defined in the X@@ SL source file . x@@ s@@ l : test@@ 1 becomes &amp; eg ; extends to ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / 19@@ 9 / X@@ SL / Trans@@ form : test@@ 1 &quot;
a requested stop@@ per must be dissolved for the associated UR@@ I and line number . this is done automatically when the first template is loaded by x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g .

there are many graphical tools to compare . so why &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ entation in many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me only showed me the changed lines , but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines . and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
&quot; this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , could display differences within a line and changes to white characters . later , a lot of other useful functions were added . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and insert it in one of the comparison windows . &quot;
&quot; a function that made a lot of work , was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; almost into a fully @-@ fle@@ dged file browser . &quot;
this is useful if two people work independently from one piece of code and make changes . the original file ( the base ) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously display the result expected . in this editor you can even edit the result directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; to merge folders :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often need to check code , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if rows only differ in a certain number of white marks , one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same , and the other is different in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both differ . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the fil@@ en@@ ame of the first file . example : &quot;
k@@ diff@@ 3 Fol@@ der 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -@@ o destination folder
&quot; the Open dialog allows you to manually typ@@ ed fil@@ en@@ ames , selecting a file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a last opened file from the drop @-@ down list . the Open dialog re@@ members your selection and displays them next time . you do not need to specify a third file ; if you leave the entry for C , the analysis of the differences with two files is performed . &quot;
&quot; on the Fol@@ der folder ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the same or merge of folders will be initiated . if for A a file is selected , for B and C however a folder , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the fil@@ en@@ ame from A in the two other folders . &quot;
&quot; if merging is checked , the input field is active for the target and can be processed . however , it is not necessarily required to set an output file immediately . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the Con@@ figuration button opens a dialog with settings . here you can set options before starting the merge / merge .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . &quot;
you can also drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you need to create two corresponding files , load them in &amp; KB and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you cannot extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only drop text into a comparison window will be supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret the dra@@ gging and dropping text into another program as cutting and inser@@ ting ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the Info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Every Info line has a different color . ( if the path to a file is too long , let the mouse take a while over the line . &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are the letters A , B and C. A has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these pres@@ ets can be changed using the Settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; if a difference is detected , one sees in the color which file differs . if both files differ , the default color is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files . this is good in the next section ( merging ) . &quot;
&quot; when differences were found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white signs are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( for C / C + + for example , white signs are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in a few rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line dividing the constitu@@ ent column from the text is interrupted at places where the source file has no lines . if the new@@ line is activated , the line is dotted with broken lines . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( under the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the inscription Edition : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Ge@@ ot@@ he &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
&quot; ! ! until all conflicts are resolved , saving is disabled ! ! ! ( use the S@@ prin@@ ge buttons for next resolved / un@@ solved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . ) &quot;
&quot; if only two comparison windows are used , each difference must be solved manually at the same time . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the summ@@ ing column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed . ( this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows , where the group &apos;s first line is not visible . ) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current range and each on the left appears a black bar . &quot;
&quot; sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or by manual editing ; then in these lines the text &amp; lt ; No line in the queue ; displayed . this is only a plac@@ eholder in the event you change your mind and maybe add another source . this text does not appear in the final saved file , nor in a marker that you might copy and paste somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflict ; however , appears in the clip@@ board if you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting sources ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs . &quot;
&quot; when you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys left , right , high , down , side up , start , end , C@@ trl @-@ start and C@@ trl @-@ end , Si@@ w as you are used by other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the input window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
a click with the left mouse button in one of the summ@@ aries synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as explained in the merge section and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons to navigate with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Down / C@@ trl @-@ picture Ab@@ road ) or to the next / previous conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the marking into the clip@@ board , you need to copy the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . there is also the option selection automatically copied . if this is enabled , whatever you mark , will automatically copy to the clip@@ board and copy the manual copy . &quot;
&quot; line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors do not use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not retain the line end of the source files , so you should not use it with bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of last used files will be automatically saved when moving and restored at the next start . ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 setup ... )
&quot; ( on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences are displayed in itali@@ c font . if the selected script does not support this display , nothing happens at all . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed ast@@ ert . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the Tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; when you press input or return , the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is enabled , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . manually copy the manual into the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line type you prefer to store . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
&quot; the second step compar@@ es each line . in this step , white characters are not ignored . in this step , white signs are ignored . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart @-@ return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others only save a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . if this option is enabled , the cart returns can be made visible , however like a white character . &quot;
&quot; this option is disabled in the first part of the analysis . in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the option is activated in default . it is effective in complicated and large files , but slowly with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before jumping into the next un@@ solved conflict . &quot;
&quot; this is useful if white characters in many files are less important . if you need this only from time to time , use better the Select A / B / C functions for any un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the Automatic Sel@@ ection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments enabled . &quot;
&quot; these options are dealt with in the chapter for scanning folders and performing a merge operation . see for details , see documentation on directory comparison and merge . &quot;
&quot; if a file is saved and already exists an older version , the original version will be added to the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g . if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ ori@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; changing this option does not affect the current program . you need to stop and restart , so that the change is active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because the language is set globally via the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry . if you activate this option , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
the selection fields for encoding will show a brief indication of what the local code is . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . )
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually adjustable , even files with different encoding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding should be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processing commands , you might not be able to work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files might be 16 @-@ bit Uni@@ code , but the pre@@ processing command can only handle 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of pre@@ processing commands . &quot;
turn this off to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white signs in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are ignor@@ ing numbers or ignor@@ ing C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ co@@ ded over@@ lay column . but sometimes you just want to see the differences between two of three files . after selection from A &amp; lt ; gt ; B , A &amp; lt ; gt ; C or B &amp; lt ; gt ; C , besides the normal still another over@@ lay column with the required information . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines . simply use the less important windows . ( this option is located in the Windows menu . )
this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the window menu . )
&quot; sometimes , consider the differences and then decide un@@ expect@@ edly to merge the files . a simple click starts the merge and uses the fil@@ en@@ ame of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass to this external command . in &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your needs . you can use this function , for example , to remove disturbing parts or to correct the ind@@ entation . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it is first given to this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command was specified ( see above ) , the output of the command is used only at the time of the line . you can write your own pre@@ processor that meets your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l are completely sufficient . &quot;

&quot; while you experiment with sed , you might begin to understand it and maybe you may like these regular expressions even . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things . &quot;
ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example for another pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; Every character between &apos; &#91; &apos; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit and every hit is sub@@ stituted by nothing .
sometimes you might want to perform multiple translations at once . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the plac@@ ements from each other . example :
&quot; if sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) is needed , per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the previous &apos; \ \ &apos; . example : &quot;
the data after the normal pre@@ processor are retained for displaying and merging . the other operations only change the data that the line comparison algorithm sees .
&quot; note : in rare cases , if you are using a normal pre@@ processor , the line comparison processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; the pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any feature that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally don &apos;t notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data . &quot;
&quot; often programmers have to edit a lot of files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge with &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; complete folders recur@@ sively . &quot;
... makes a suggestion for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start
... can simulate the merge and display the simulated changes without really performing it
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with the selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to comparing and merging single files . you only need to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog file .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder was specified , use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders automatically starts , not the merge . to start merging , you need to select the appropriate menu item or press the F@@ 7 key . ( see more details ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed a small news window about current progress . if you cancel the file scanning , only the files that have been compared to that point are listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left side , ... &quot;
&quot; each file and folder , found during the scan , is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click . &quot;
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can open a folder by double @-@ clicking on + / - or double @-@ clicking on the object , or by double @-@ clicking the arrow keys for left / right . &quot;
&quot; when you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison is started and a comparison window appears . &quot;
the icon in the Name column reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , it is visible in the columns A / B / C and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . if the merge operation is started , you will be informed about problems of this type . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; however , with identical entries the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are considered identi@@ cally if their entire content is identical . then folders have the same color . for folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ t@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow and later when it is old , red . &quot;
... &quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not a : copy A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , merging cannot be started . &quot;
... A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B a file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist the merging can not be started .
&quot; the mode for syn@@ cing is active if only two folders and no explicit target folders are specified and if the option directories are synchron@@ ised . then choose &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then select the necessary action , so that both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible file names for the output file only B ; copied directly after the merge &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; if two folders are merged and select the new file instead of merge ( unsure ) , then a error message will be investigated . if the files are different but the same date will appear , then an error message appears : files are different , but the date is identical . if such errors are not eliminated , the merge of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; when merging , one file after another is processed . you status column shows up when the merge has been successful , and corresponding to other messages when something unexpected happens . if the merge is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the setup dialog the file comparison method is selected full @-@ time analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , deleted , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only displayed if three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the selected entry ( file or Od@@ ner ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the clas@@ h actions ( even in all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you have not specified a destination folder , the three @-@ folder merge mode is used as the target . B and / or B are used as the target when synchron@@ izing A and / or B . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries should be in the destination folder , also in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped by certain entries . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the list menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . to merge only the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if invalid merge actions exist through conflic@@ ting file types , a message appears which points to the incorrect elements . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all entries , a dialog window appears with the options through , simul@@ ating and Canc@@ el . &quot;
select Sim@@ ulate if you would like to see what would happen without the real changes made . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , a merge window opens ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; when you &apos;re done with a file , select / continue directory merge or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t saved yet , an appropriate dialog will appear . then , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 will continue its work with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the list , you will see some error messages that will help you to solve the cause of the problem . if you continue the merge ( F@@ 7 key ) , you will have the option to select another action for the entry or solve the problem in other ways before you proceed with merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , the entries ( in the current session ) will not work together again . even if the merging has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries are considered to be finished . only if you change the merge action , these entries will be merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 ... ) now has a section called list merge with these options :
only files that fit on the specified pattern are displayed in the element tree . multiple patterns can be entered . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid wild@@ cards : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . ( e.g. * .@@ c@@ pp ; * .@@ h ) . the default is * . folders must not match this pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than a pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid plac@@ eholder : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally created files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this can be set to folder specific with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some fil@@ es@@ ystems , files have a hidden attribute . in other file systems , a leading dot marks a file as hidden . this option lets you decide if these files are to be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is enabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files are compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; for links to folders : if the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . &quot;
&quot; ( the number of sol@@ dered , un@@ solved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ) Full analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files containing no text . ( enter an appropriate anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare a large folder via a slow network , it may be faster to compare only the modification date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . &quot;
&quot; this can be useful , for example , when copying the modification date is lost . please use caution . this option is switched off in default . &quot;
&quot; activate the synchronization mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder has been specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging are selected so that afterwards both folders are identical . also , the results of merging files are stored in both folders . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , instead of merging the new file will be proposed as action . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file already exists with the .@@ ori@@ g extension , it will be deleted without further backup . this also affects the normal merging of individual files , not only merging entire folders . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view is visible while merging single files ; you can shift the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want to , you can switch the main window in the window menu and switch between the two views by switching between directory and text window . &quot;
&quot; you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . nevertheless , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the directory menu . you can also merge a single file directly , without first merging the folder together . &quot;
&quot; however , this status is lost when you re @-@ read the directory : directory menu : re @-@ read &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slave . K@@ Diff@@ 3 uses this to read files and folders . in this way you can specify files and folders to open that are located on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file with an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders . you should note a few things :
&quot; a path can be relative and . or .. included . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters have to be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , space &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file named / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file will always be accepted as a link target . ( ft@@ p : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or modification date . therefore , the per@@ missions or the change of change devi@@ ate from the original . ( this is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose is currently the difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP , press the right mouse button over the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part view from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally needs &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is used as a part , accepts &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then removes the name of the original files from the patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . then start &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the Kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select &quot; &quot; Pre@@ view &quot; &quot; from the context menu . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the patch file has been created . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; being executed as part , it only supports the comparing of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ 2 ( now it &apos;s compact ) are already available . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already points out that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool Collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a very long time and learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and the configure script is probably not given the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default , configure is installed in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE can not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ diff@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are first treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . &quot;
&quot; the editor notes for any difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . however , this important information is lost if the result is simply saved as text file and it is much effort to create a separate file format that could save this information . &quot;
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text a different editor should be used .
after removing text is suddenly lt ; no sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does this mean and how can it be removed ?
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . please use another editor for this .
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from the Wild Wild Web . thank you !
to use all functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.1 or later .
information on how to use K@@ Diff@@ 3 on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install on a system with &amp; k@@ de ; to compile and install , use the following command in the base folder of the &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir gives the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; since &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . nevertheless , if difficulties occur , please refer to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
cut out ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift Rem@@ ove ) copied to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert ( C@@ trl @-@ V or Shift In@@ sert ) add the text from the clip@@ board to the current cursor position or replace the current marker .
&quot; only show differences : files that are identical in all folders are not in the folder structure , and therefore not in the destination folder . &quot;
&quot; ( in the current program version , you must re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . ) &quot;
&quot; only entries are displayed that show differences . this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after the merge . ( the behavior will probably be de@@ activated in a later program version . ) &quot;
&quot; note the buttons to select the source with cap@@ tion A , B and C below the menu bar . if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . under@@ scores in individual characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; displays a thumb@@ nail of all virtual working areas . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work@@ tops , change their size , change them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual work@@ tops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved ; the movement is possible within a working surface as well as other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : if on the empty background of &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; click on , the context menu has only the two entries P@@ ager ... and exit . if however , click on an application inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; however , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , On Desktop and Finish . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows inside the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also to other work surfaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is ti@@ cked , the name of the virtual work@@ space will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; tick this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; display the numbers of virtual work@@ tops . if it is checked together with name , the names will be provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the background of each desktop will also be shown as background in &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; &quot;
&quot; when this field is checked , the running programs are shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty spaces are displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simply shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default icon and pix@@ map shows a small view of the real program window . note : Pix@@ map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; main window can be determined : classi@@ cally , &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; in a 2x@@ N grid , as from p@@ ager applications in some other Windows managers , horizont@@ ally shows all virtual work@@ tops in a vertical row , which is very good for viewing later@@ ally on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , displaying and moving windows as symbols or with its contents . besides , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
right @-@ click inside &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and selecting switch settings ... allows the dialog to appear .
currently it is not possible to change settings in the dialog . but you can do this manually :
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor such as &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ . if you don &apos;t have any write permission for the file , you must register as user root or turn to your system administrator . &quot;
&quot; da &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; part of the package is k@@ de@@ base , you need a functioning installation of the K@@ DE base packages . &quot;

&quot; you can use &amp; K@@ mag ; to enlarge a part of the screen , as if you read a magni@@ fying glass for the printed or the exact viewing of a photo . this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly being expanded to include new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
&quot; when you start &amp; K@@ mag ; start , a window appears as pic@@ tured above . the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; displays the enlarged area of the screen . below , this window is called a magni@@ fying window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , &amp; K@@ mag ; the area around the mouse poin@@ ter like a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you may want to represent a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid that the mouse cursor is displayed in the enlarged window , select the setting mouse cursor . please note that this is not yet able to detect the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default k@@ de ; / Q@@ t ; mouse cursor . &quot;
&quot; in the selection window mode , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse buttons and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the content of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift key , press or the &amp; M@@ MB ; use , you can move the selection window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the selection window . note that the top left corner of the selection window stays firmly and only the lower right corner is to move . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; has a lot of functions . you can send the enlarged picture directly to the printer , store into a file , copy into the clip@@ board ( to paste it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and more . &quot;
the stop of the update causes the needed CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Ger@@ ing , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will be displayed . the selected area will be displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , opening a new window , printing , rel@@ o@@ ading ( with the button Document again in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , enlar@@ ging and reduction &amp; etc ; . &quot;
&quot; you can use &amp; k@@ magni@@ fier ; to use a magni@@ fier area , as if you use a magni@@ fier to view the printed printed in a newspaper or a photo . this application is useful for different people of use : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter remains in the same place . it is meant to help people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive @-@ Stra@@ in In@@ jury Syn@@ drome ) and which each mouse click prepares pain . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter remains in the same place . it is meant to help people who suffer from the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) Syn@@ drome and which each mouse click em@@ ulate pain . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from pain associated with the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this hasn &apos;t happened yet . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to avoid pain , which is caused by clicking with the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse , and as with all ergonomic tools : the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; monitors your mouse movements and performs a mouse click as soon as you break the movement .
&quot; the intelligent shift is activated , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pause after it has manipul@@ ated the mouse button . move the mouse , wait until the end of the movement before releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this dwell time must be logged after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a mouse click .
&quot; if Intel@@ lig@@ ently switched on is switched on , the shooting time is activated ( 1 / 10 s ) . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing the mouse button , the mouse button is waiting until the mouse button is closed again . &quot;
&quot; this function activ@@ ates a slow moving to the right and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . these movements are stored in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the first time is started , but they can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can &amp; k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten the reaction time . go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and here the tab General . there is a slider sound buffer , which you can set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; with G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the button , the settings are reset to the stand after the last push of the user . &quot;
&quot; the best thing is to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the default settings . in particular , the intelligent shift should be turned off at first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later move the intelligent shift . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it is necessary to reduce the response times of &amp; k@@ de ; to reduce sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of which places a mouse click does not have any effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not display a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the rolls that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to remove the mouse ball . as this happens , mouse to mouse varies . but it should be clear if you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the rolls . these are located at the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can easily be scrat@@ ched with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts the execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you are using an intelligent shift in this case , this means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens if you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use a different window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you can run a mouse click yourself . hereby , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool will be reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you enter text , try and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor in another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor over where you want it . however , parking your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop when you want to make a ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke . safe zones for the mouse poin@@ ter are &amp; eg ; the gray areas around the tool@@ bar and menus and the head@@ lines of windows . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent shift , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the intelligent shift is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes its time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible in this way to mark text , copy it into the clip@@ board and insert it again or perform any other action in which you can move the mouse with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; do not use the intelligent shift if you just start using and k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select one mouse click at the end of the text area and hold the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble mouse click . this will always play when &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the mouse button pressed a sound like a mouse click . so you know exactly when when moving at intelligent shifting the shift time begins . later , you can use the intelligent shift without the audi@@ ble mouse click . &quot;
&quot; to use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use , the X@@ test extension for &amp; X Window needs to be installed . this should be the case in most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and is set up correctly .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pressed the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter res@@ ides . this program was developed for people suffering from R@@ SI syndrome , causing pain to be operated . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured in such a way that a pulling process starts before the mouse button is released . in this way , drag and drop can also be performed with the mouse . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program , with which silent users can let their computer talk for themselves . &quot;
&quot; with the program &amp; k@@ mouth , silent users can let the computer talk for themselves . the user can choose phrases that are to be spoken once again from a list of the conversation . &quot;
&quot; on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) , enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . for more details see the description of the setup dialog . &quot;
&quot; on the second page , select the default text passages . from the text passages , you can often choose text passages , without having to type them in . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen@@ shot ) , you determine the vocabulary for Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ ones . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . in addition , you can synchron@@ ize the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be recorded into words . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and essentially contains an input field for the keyboard input of your sentences ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and an exp@@ ir@@ ation memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have k@@ mouth correctly , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sentences that are to be spoken once . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog by &amp; k@@ mouth ; . this dialog contains two flash@@ cards , voice output and settings , the site configuration and the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the flash@@ card speech output , enter the command to call the language generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , insert the character encoding , with the text to be passed to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to pass the text on . select the check box , if the text is to be passed unchanged as standard input to the language generator . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed on as a parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation for your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with possibility of using kt@@ ts@@ d as a voice service &amp; k@@ mouth ; first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if that is successful , the other settings will be ignored on this page . the kt@@ ts@@ d @-@ language service is a standardized interface for voice output and is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . choosing this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text passages book or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ fort@@ über@@ weisung , the selected text passage is spoken directly and additionally inserted into the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down button of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text pass@@ book should be automatically saved when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; save the book with the selection of text passages . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text passages book will not be saved . select Before saving , becomes &amp; k@@ mouth ; ask if the text passages should be saved . &quot;
&quot; the Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ asing page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for the Wor@@ ter@@ eph@@ ones . in the main window next to the input field shows &amp; k@@ mouth ; a selection box , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; using the buttons to the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . &quot;
select the language you want for this source ; &amp; k@@ mouth ; then read the &amp; k@@ mouth ; the frequency of the individual words is simply determined by counting the occurrence . additionally you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert only properly written words into the new dictionary .
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; asks which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged and how they want to be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you place a new empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically inserts into the dictionary , you create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
&quot; the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part , the text passages are displayed as tree structure . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the corresponding short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passages , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; add actions like new text passages or books or delete selected text passages and books , either through the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
you can change the order of text passages or text passages by dra@@ gging the mouse to the new position or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt key .
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the default memory . &quot;
&quot; the currently active proposition is spoken . if the text is in the input field , it is used , otherwise the selected sentences of the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding tool bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . the tool@@ bar is ordered by default over the editing pane directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a narrow bar is displayed in the lower part of the main window with hints about the status of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is crossed , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the tool@@ bar is located directly under the tool@@ bar via the editing pane . by clicking on the left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably did not have the command for the voice output correct or not fully entered . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General settings and enter the voice output command on the language edition . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ izer for more details . ) &quot;
&quot; at the moment only English , Spanish and Wel@@ sh are supported . the license allows to use the Festival free of charge and to propag@@ ate without any restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to display an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that the festival will be installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in &amp; Java . currently , it only supports the English pron@@ unciation . &quot;
&quot; to display an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ett folder . the voice output is then possible with one of the following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be enabled as default input . ( this is the recommended example of the application of Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to dis@@ assemble the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert the German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately Ha@@ di@@ fax is happy to swallow the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( Cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . the option to send data as standard input must be enabled .
&quot; the voice output dem@@ on of &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a voice service , which provides all &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems . &quot;
&quot; since the setting of the language generator is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only need to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a voice service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to set up , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page that appears in the &amp; k@@ mouth settings dialog ; if K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use it successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but it depends on your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot talk , can output text by the computer . it is stored a list of already spoken sentences , which the user can always be re@@ charged . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no language synthes@@ izer includes . a speech synthes@@ izer has to be installed on the computer .

&quot; at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as no speakers are set up , the card holder is displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card General will appear . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , as well as different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you can also set up several variants for a synthes@@ izer . &quot;
various speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; if you click on the flash@@ card driver in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card holder is displayed . this also appears automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up yet . &quot;
all speakers already established appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .

click on one of these buttons to make your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; choose a type of tuning here , there are three male and three female voices as well as a boys and girls &apos; voice to choose from . &quot;
&quot; if you click here , the new speaker will appear on the flash@@ card speaker . to change the settings of this speaker click Edit . &quot;
&quot; now you can use kt@@ ts ; almost use it . go back to the card map and check if voice output is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is ti@@ cked to allow the T@@ TS service to read . see . now , you can click &amp; kt@@ ts ; use to create text orders and manage text jobs . &quot;
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the language teaching system of &amp; k@@ de ; click the General tab in General to open this map . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; this starts the K@@ DE T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card will be displayed and you can create and read text jobs . see . remove the marking , K@@ TT@@ SD is stopped and the T@@ TS system is de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; when kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is terminated , it works ; further , if the voice output field is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is activated . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the system area of the control bar , it disappears again as soon as the pre @-@ reading is finished . &quot;
&quot; buttons in this series allow you to start , cancel , pause , pause and resume text jobs . &quot;
&quot; using the buttons in this row , you can read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also switch the speaker for a job . &quot;
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied to all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card box orders will only be displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and activate voice output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then check the text that is to be read and select the Text Editor main menu . after a short time , the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can also skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML ; pre @-@ tension@@ ers and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Plac@@ ards ; the advanced text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text displayed . first check , if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then select the text that should be read before , and select the Text Editor main menu . then the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; kate ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ not@@ fy is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you about events that you have set up . you can also read the text of this news from &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program by &amp; k@@ de ; you can set up different types of messages ; for example , set up that you will be notified when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel where your nick@@ name appears . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Noti@@ fy , a menu entry will appear in the menu Settings menu . the possible settings for K@@ Noti@@ fy differ depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the k@@ mail@@ .x@@ ml file , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages sent by K@@ Mail , and also the term / local / in@@ box , as this can be assumed in most cases as assumed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; it is useful for improving the pron@@ unciation , to replace un@@ spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to deal with certain defici@@ encies of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; in order to understand the working of filters , it is important to know how the &quot; speech dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program works with a text . it distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; screen editing has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . if the output of the screen reader is read , the orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning has priority and keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders will continue after the issue of warning .
&quot; messages have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; al@@ erts are also news . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . every order you receive from the card box is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of a applications that uses text orders . text orders are intended for the output of longer texts , which don &apos;t have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order types are processed in queu@@ es , with the exception of the output of screen re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a screen reader , while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one reads , this issue is stopped and finished . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen editing . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are designed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; string plac@@ ements replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; will be supplied with pre@@ defined string replacement filters , which allow the creation of chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for format@@ ting messages from &amp; kon@@ vers@@ ation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better understandable way . &quot;
&amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use a X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert &amp; XML ; from one format to another format .
&quot; with subscri@@ ber selection filters , you can send orders depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that has sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent to a speaker . for example , if you have set a female voice on the card board , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . si@@ p . read about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these filters has adjustable rules , after which it is applied for a voice output . if the filter determines that its rules do not apply , it continues the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a k@@ de ; notification to &amp; kt@@ ts ; sent , it is edited by all activated filters installed on the page . editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . filters are processed from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following direction dialo@@ gs will be shown below . &quot;
&quot; for setting string replacement filters , you must enter a list of words or regular expressions as comparative patterns . if these patterns are found in the text , then the text is exchanged for the corresponding replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can select this name at any time , it only needs to be different from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with the strings in the column agreement and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Re@@ place column . the list is processed in the displayed sequence from top to bottom .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or the regular expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file will be attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter is only applied when the speaker speaks one of the languages listed here . click on the button to display a list of languages . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered here , the filter is only applied when the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application id of running programs can be obtained with the program q@@ d@@ bus ; . the &amp; d@@ bus ; numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , the application ID copied @-@ 34@@ 32 , you may only enter a copy . &quot;
&quot; the string replacement filter is applied only to the text , if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if all input fields are empty , the filter is applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; in comparison to words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . so words must be limited by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) on both sides . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will not find instructions for writing regular expressions . if you have the &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can call it in the dialo@@ gs Add or Edit as help to assemble these expressions . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; conver@@ ters translate &amp; XML ; using X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . however , it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system . &quot;
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is accessible via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the subscri@@ ber selection filter , you can send texts to a specific speaker , set up on the flash@@ card speaker , or to a speaker with certain properties . for example , you can specify that texts by k@@ mail should be read by a female voice . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; a text sent to the filter , there is a narr@@ ator for the text . the speaker is selected by the speaker properties that the program dict@@ ates , which sends the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; send , and the characteristics of the speaker set on the card board . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of &amp; k@@ de ; editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; Ex@@ pres@@ sions installed , you can click on the button to get help when entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve a faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker is selected to test the desired requirements . click on the button to the right to view the dialog box selection . &quot;
use these buttons to store or load your subscri@@ ber settings or to delete all settings .
the subscri@@ ber selection filter is only applied to the text if all conditions apply with an entry in the box Di@@ esen Filter if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice output API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which programmers can lend their applications T@@ TS capabilities . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD with the language synthes@@ izer , so that &amp; kt@@ ts ; this synthes@@ izer can use . &quot;
the following section contains a short description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus ; interface of the voice output API of &amp; k@@ de ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found on the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice delivery services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ Interface of &amp; k@@ de ; from the program kt@@ ts@@ d via the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc ; &quot;
there are even more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you give
&quot; open two &amp; console ; window . start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the named language synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the &amp; HTML ; -@@ XML ; re@@ forming filter , but when using the module for festival web pages are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able can work at all . you must also make sure that the program x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is installed and can be found on the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause errors in synthes@@ iz@@ ers , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only gi@@ b@@ ber@@ ish . what can I do about it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure that the character encoding option is set to the correct value for the appropriate language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be corrected by a string replacement filter . &quot;

&quot; the speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are used by &amp; kt@@ ts , have their own license you can find in the related documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can fill the package with kt@@ ts@@ d ; you can download it in the kt@@ ts@@ d folder . in addition , you will find the source code of k@@ de@@ bian under ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;

K@@ T@@ TS works with any language synthes@@ izer which can be launched on the command line in a single console .
&quot; the list of languages above can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , drag the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . &quot;
&quot; the speech @-@ pat@@ cher program uses an adap@@ table module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you want to expand &amp; kt@@ ts ; for the use of another synthes@@ izer , please contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the &amp; XML ; conversion filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using the apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c command . &quot;
&quot; to compile &amp; kt@@ ts ; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or later ) including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the &quot; speech @-@ dis@@ pat@@ cher &quot; program . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for k@@ de@@ bian or the tar@@ ball created every night , compile and install the program with the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use it , first check whether speech dis@@ pat@@ chers work properly with your language synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts ; the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ gr is to be developed in such a way that the setup of speech pat@@ chers is possible , and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is broken down into single sentences . the user can return pun@@ ctu@@ ation or sentence , pause , pause , or cancel the issue . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female , this will be used , otherwise the best appropriate speaker will be chosen . if you want to know more about it , how &amp; kt@@ ts ; a speaker selected , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the tab actors to add , and to add a speaker to the list or click Edit , the card holder device will be displayed . as an example , the setup of the module for Festival Inter@@ active will be shown below . for details on the modules , please refer to . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you only have to enter the festival . &quot;
&quot; select the encoding for text that is passed to festival . in voices , the kt@@ ts ; known , this setting is done automatically . generally , Western languages use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 1 , Eastern languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; with these sliding controls you set the volume , speech speed and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select a number of controllers and this gray will be displayed , the voice you selected does not allow these settings to be displayed . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set will be synthes@@ ized faster ( with greater memory consumption ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not set up a speaker yet ( or click App@@ ly ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked , the program window is displayed kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to view the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is not running , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the order , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the currently edited set . the speaker ID corresponds to the ID column on the card holder . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can move forward or backward in the order that is selected in the list below . ( but not every order is made up of several sentences ) . &quot;
&quot; with one click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other flash@@ cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system segment . then click on this icon to view the program window again . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click on the audio card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text assignments are performed and managed . issues of screen editing , warning messages and messages are not displayed . for more information about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts , please refer to . &quot;
&quot; choose the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , it has been compiled &amp; kt@@ ts ; either without support for the corresponding audio module or kt@@ ts ; can not load the required libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de for audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . &quot;
&quot; set the speaking speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % corresponds to about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about double normal speech speed . so that these settings can be implemented , the program must be installed so@@ x . &quot;
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules that are set up in your system . most of them will not work . you need to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose standard .
&quot; on this card you can set up special actions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &amp; kt@@ ts ; processes four types of voice orders : &quot;
&quot; screen editing has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and stops these orders . once the output of the screen reader is read , the orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the next highest priority . this level is important news like &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . a warning keeps the output of news and normal text . these orders are resum@@ ed after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks messages . if you have just read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; nevertheless someone who just enters the room . &quot;
&quot; a text assignment interrupted by a message , warning or the output of a screen reader , adds &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output enters the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text job is interrupted . if both the sound as well as the introductory message are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card map only apply to normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the editions of screen re@@ a@@ ders there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with a higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; K@@ Noti@@ fy messages read before , start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click al@@ erts . the card notification appears . &quot;
&quot; mark this check box to disable reading &amp; k@@ de ; if this setting is not checked , the other settings are disabled and / kt@@ ts ; does not read al@@ erts . &quot;
&quot; when this setting is selected , noti@@ fications with which a sound is played is not read out . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click on the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; conversation ; sent when someone in an I@@ RC message mention your nick@@ name . &quot;
&quot; all events , for which nothing else is specified in the list , are ignored . &quot;
use this sel@@ ector to specify what &amp; kt@@ ts ; do when an event arrives . you have the following choices :
&quot; if you have selected user @-@ defined text , enter the desired text . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . default sel@@ ects the speaker that appears in the list on the card holder as the top entry . see also .
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a particular application , it will be executed . otherwise , the action will be carried out for all other events of the particular application . &quot;
&quot; the event All noti@@ fications for the application standard ( all other events cannot be deleted from the list . for this , you can set the default noti@@ fications as follows : &quot;
&quot; use the Save button to save the settings for the al@@ erts into a file . use the Save button to load saved settings from a file . the loaded events will be merged with the events in the list . if you want to start with an empty list , click Del@@ ete . all entries except All noti@@ fications will be deleted . &quot;
&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard for marking text for voice output . this standard contains labels for controlling voices , speech speed , volume , gender of voice and pitch . SS@@ ML is a part of Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML specification , another W3@@ C standard . &quot;
currently supported &amp; kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following restrictions exist :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British male ) , since this is the default voice , the festival is used in the edition of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if the settings for speed or tone in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100 % , the SS@@ ML text is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into single sentences . thus , you can skip or stop or stop orders on the card map , even if the speech synthes@@ izer is not directly supported . &quot;
&quot; here you see the set @-@ limits detection filter . at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add further set @-@ line detection filters , but beginners will get rid of it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn the setup of the subscri@@ ber selection by trying out . switch off the subscri@@ ber selection and enter text to read . then switch off the subscri@@ ber selection , change some features and check how the speaker selection changed . &quot;
&quot; and kt@@ ts ; then faster with the reading can begin , since only the first set must be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a long time , &quot;
&quot; you can then stop or cancel text jobs on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters is automatically set up when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , just removed . do not change anything about this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tabl@@ ature ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the pun@@ ctu@@ ation limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ gs ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ vers . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal set of pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters , you can insert it again by downloading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the card @-@ card reader selection , you can over@@ write the subscri@@ ber settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top@@ most on the card speaker ) . in other words : there are no speaker properties defined .
&quot; use of the fitt@@ est speaker , which displays all properties of a set speaker . if you do not delete or edit the speaker &apos;s settings , select &amp; kt@@ ts ; this speaker is selected . otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker that is the most likely to match the original features . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select the properties of the desired speaker here . if this property does not play a role , don &apos;t enter anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should have priority over other properties . you can also set several markings here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor in understanding the issue , it is always treated as priority property . you will rarely use this property . the only case where you may want to specify the attribute language is before you know that a certain application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to delete all features in the area speaker , which is most likely to er@@ ase the following , click the default speaker button and then use the speaker that corresponds to the following . &quot;
&quot; in this case , 0 is for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without order number , the input 0 is required ) . &quot;
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr stops immediately when it is started . I compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I don &apos;t get back@@ tracking . &quot;
&quot; you probably need to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not solved , G@@ Stre@@ amer is probably a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I get a text order , freezes and kt@@ ts ; a . on the &amp; console ; a message that states : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; on your system , there is the problem of conflicts with AL@@ SA that prevent the simultaneous opening of multiple PC@@ M devices . see the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;

&quot; on the card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ om@@ ic modules like Festival Inter@@ active offer a setting for speed . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the speech speed are ignored if &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; pre@@ reads . ( this is because the HTML is converted into SS@@ ML . ) De@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; ( see ) or , if you are very brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ to @-@ SS@@ ML conversion filter , and set the speech speed up . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage to read web pages with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker but &amp; kt@@ ts ; reads the web pages with a male voice .
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the tag S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . thus , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the x@@ s@@ l file for converting the SS@@ ML to S@@ aber the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to the VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added an own string substitute filter and now I can go in &amp; kt@@ ts ; no more set @-@ up or go back . on the cart@@ on track orders are displayed , the job is only composed of one sentence . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; use pun@@ ctu@@ ation characters ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) you are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection instead . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio output . if your system also counts , you cannot simultaneously play music and read a text . it also freezes when you pause a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Co@@ de does not support any true breaks . if you hold a text order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current set will be read yet . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general setting of the speech speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install so@@ x with the apt @-@ get install so@@ x command . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded a tar@@ ball ( tar @-@ packed archive ) , register as normal user and un@@ pack the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;
in &amp; k@@ de ; 4 will be the module &amp; arts ; probably removed or at least only created on request .
&quot; the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default , some of which have a running time dependency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the directives of the Deb@@ ian distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; default : in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . &quot;
on Deb@@ ian systems / usr / local is the right folder for programs translated from sources .

&quot; before you use it , first check whether your speech synthes@@ izer works properly . follow the instructions you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; the festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers whose source code is exposed . the quality of the voices is generally good , and several voices and languages are supported . &quot;
&quot; you need to install at least one language . you will find help in the instructions provided with the festival . if you want to read websites , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to limitations when passing on . &quot;
&quot; this voice pres@@ upp@@ oses Festival 1.@@ 95 beta or newer . the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / or / r@@ ussi@@ an . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter for the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . choose a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 @-@ bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival is usually included in the &amp; Linux distri@@ butions . look for the festival first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
festival can be used together with the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA synthes@@ izer . then Festival takes over the le@@ x@@ ical analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; it generates the audio output . the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; program and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voices can be downloaded from
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete language distribution system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generates language from di@@ phone files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival creates this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required Di@@ phon@@ e.@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also be produced from German lyrics Di@@ phone .
&quot; in this procedure , additional wra@@ pper code will be added to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice file voices . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; voice files are not installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA file , but in the festival / li@@ b / . &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; votes . required either Festival Version 1.@@ 4.1 or Festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download MS German Festival &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you have downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , playback of bug fixes is not required , you just have to re @-@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ em@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; voice location &quot; german _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 2 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
&quot; this procedure uses special code to give the language about festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA voice . grab and install the Festival and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA , and make sure both of them work . then download Festival @-@ Czech &quot;
un@@ pack the program with tar in a suitable folder and create the en@@ cyclo@@ pedia . the exec@@ utable file festival must be in your P@@ AT@@ H .
download the cz@@ 2 voice file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA file .

&quot; festival Lite is a free speech synthes@@ izer , which currently only supports a limited number of voices and languages . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with an even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can set neither pitch , volume or speech speed with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
Fl@@ ite is usually included in the Linux distri@@ butions . search Fl@@ ite as the first on the CDs of your distribution .
&quot; Ha@@ di@@ fix is a two @-@ stage speech synthes@@ izer working with di@@ ph@@ ons . the program t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o transl@@ ates text into Di@@ phone and the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . language quality is good , but the support is currently limited to a few languages . you can adjust voice , pitch , speech speed and volume via kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . &quot;
&quot; at least , download a German language file from the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; page and un@@ zip it with un@@ zip into the / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA folders . &quot;
&quot; copy either t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c to ~ / .@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ or@@ c or to / etc / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o , here the r@@ c must be removed at the end of the fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
select a voice and set the paths to &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o correct .
&quot; EP@@ OS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener speech synthes@@ izer for Czech and Slovak langu@@ age@@ . it is a simple speech synthes@@ izer with an even sufficient voice quality . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can adjust only the volume with this speech synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; click Add . select the Czech or Slovak language and EP@@ s T@@ TS speech synthes@@ izer . if the epic programs are not in your P@@ AT@@ H , enter the path to the programs on the card box speaker . in the input fields you can enter additional parameters for the programs . enter in a &amp; console ; epo@@ s -@@ h or say -@@ h to get more information . &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a free , qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ener speech synthes@@ izer written in &amp; Java ; i.e. you need to install the &amp; Java ; Virtual Machine on your system . with &amp; Java ; you can &apos;t adjust pitch , volume or speech speed . &quot;
&quot; the command module enables you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; with any language synthes@@ izer , which can be controlled on the command line . &quot;
&quot; best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , rather than sending the output directly to the audio device . &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf , which enables administration of network interfaces , routing , and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a series of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated surface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package has been developed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings is displayed in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; the network settings ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Network network settings in &amp; K@@ Menu ; started . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot install . physical devices and their drivers must be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device actually displays and allows setting of network properties . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and set up when installing &amp; Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers must be loaded by adapting the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the Network Set@@ ting option is selected in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; -@@ Index . when starting the module network settings , this will automatically detect the platform used on the system . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be recognized , the manual selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which corresponds to the distribution and the rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . by marking the setting of non @-@ recurring questions , the definition can be permanently hit . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . previously , all options are displayed gray , meaning the settings can only be viewed , changing is not possible . &quot;
&quot; in the system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . this is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the tab network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be carried out by the Reiter Network interfaces :
the settings of displayed network interfaces can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... to set up in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic selection , the TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in the automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system will be done with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all required TCP / IP information at every system start , so no further setting is required . &quot;
&quot; with the selection Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the input field IP address , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this option is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be enabled . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are displayed as properties of the device in the device list .
&quot; it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . the input of an existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . with ping in the network , you can determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt , the network administrator should be asked . &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . switching off an disabled network device is activated by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; depending on your needs , network devices can be activated or switched off . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on the interface .... &quot;
&quot; speci@@ fies the host IP address in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default for TCP / IP communications with computers in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network in which the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host calls ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS replaces this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; entries can be added , removed or changed . DNS records can be added , removed , or changed . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the group machine to name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will show the dialog New nam@@ eser@@ ver . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be inserted in the list . &quot;
select an entry from the group machine to the name resolution and then click the Edit button .... You will see the Edit dialog .
&quot; the list of name @-@ known calcul@@ ators describes host@@ name @-@ to @-@ IP address links for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used during boot when no DNS servers are available . in small , remote networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; usually , the list contains name @-@ known hosts some entries , which support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os ; and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . this version of IP still in the test should replace version 4 in future . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add .... Add the dialog New Ali@@ as will be displayed .
&quot; enter the name of the known calcul@@ ator and click Add button . if the known computer has multiple alias names , press the Add button multiple times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a name that is known to name from the list and select Edit .... The dialog Get@@ ting Calcul@@ ator will be displayed .
&quot; it can be executed one of the following tasks , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; the settings made in the module network settings are not immediately implemented in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be set . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install it in a &amp; console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a graphical user interface like k@@ package or the installation tool for your distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; for this case the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but additionally the development packages with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is recommended only by experienced users . however , it is not difficult to compile &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the following commands should do this . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information about basic network technology is given ; in the second , all configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the inclusion of the PC is medi@@ ated into a small ( home ) network . &quot;
&quot; currently , IP networks with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) are operated . IP@@ v@@ 6 has never been widely used . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to be in the near future . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at &amp; eg ; work@@ station , the network administrator is the contact point , which addresses a valid IP address , or if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a range reserved for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded to the Internet , so any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet for such machines can be enabled by setting a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the area is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = your own computer ) . &quot;
&quot; the net address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically modified with DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is any other content than specified there in case of active DSL connections . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; Su@@ SE , it is known that this file is sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand as expected can therefore occur . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store multiple archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which also provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing . the second goal was to answer a question that my wife asked : how much longer does it take when you secure ? &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be included by &amp; dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; how@@ l the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . recognise &amp; k@@ dat ; don &apos;t be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; recognizes &amp; dat ; the pre@@ sp@@ ect , looks for the appropriate index on your disk . if this cannot be found , you &apos;ll be asked if the band index is to be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; if everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes , to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by fl@@ aps of the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to do this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; dated ; there is a change of the symbol for the tape to recognize that the inclusion for the tape is solved , and shows a corresponding message in the status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used by &amp; dat , it must be format@@ ted by and dat . &quot;
&quot; a tape type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to save data . if your tape drive requires that a tape must be format@@ ted before use , this must happen before you be format@@ ted by the tape . flo@@ ppy tape drives normally do not require format@@ ting of tape , DA@@ T drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , &amp; k@@ dat continues ; with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and is ready for use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are secured .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save in the Save menu ...
&quot; once the backup has been started , the dialog opens up settings for backup . in this dialog you can check the selected files again and change the settings for backup . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings , the backup will appear . the dialog shows the progress of the backup process including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . only the selected file or folder will be checked .
mark the files in one of the archives in the entry for the band with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu item to check ....
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for review . in this dialog you can review your selection and change the work folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the settings for verification , the dialog will appear . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
&quot; before you can initiate the restore , the files that are to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be restored .
right click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore ...
&quot; once the recovery process has been started , the dialog will appear for recovery . in this dialog you can review your selection and change the work folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; once you have confirmed the settings for recovery , the dialog will appear again . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and the remaining time . &quot;
sometimes it is necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file on the basis of the band content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can create the index in two ways :
this creates a backup profile with the currently selected files and the default settings . you can set the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured is automatically updated according to the currently selected working folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located in the same file system , such as the folder . folders that are located on the same file system , can be stored separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar regardless of the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file is used . only the files that have changed since that time . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file is created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set up the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . you can make the following settings :
the complete path to the device file for the tape drive ( normally / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape .
&quot; this setting is active , transmitted &amp; dat ; before the tape is integrated , the command will be loaded into the drive . in some drives , this is necessary before reading or writing operations can be performed . &quot;
&quot; the option is enabled , tried &amp; dated ; to lock the ej@@ ection of the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work with all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , the tape is automatically dis@@ car@@ ded when releasing the &amp; k@@ dat file ; do not use this option with flo@@ ppy Stre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; not all drives support variable block sizes . not all drives support variable block sizes . no matter if this setting is active or not , you need to tell &amp; k@@ dat ; in any case the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should only prove a memory block on the tape . the contents of the file will be composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the volume of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the full name of the system on which the tape was format@@ ted . seconds is the number of seconds that have passed since the era in which the tape was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
the remaining files on the tape are pure tar archives that can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as they are not incre@@ mental back@@ ups .
check the contents of a backup tape . this symbol is only active when a band is involved .
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; viewer for system protocols . the program is for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files . in addition , enables &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access quick access to information about problems that occur on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system has the various protocol files stored . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; experienced users access quick access , for example , to information about problems appearing on their server . hence , try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
in the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; a number of useful functions . these include :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the format of the Sy@@ slo@@ g server and for Sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions are available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open to you , and it opens itself instead of a small news window , so you have &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; most likely do not start with system administrator privileges . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion , or after entered strings . the list of the log lines will now be displayed automatically , so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter . in the default setting , a record line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included . &quot;
&quot; you can of course select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then only matched to the entries in the column selected . for example , in the log file system protocol , select the process column , and then apply in the filter bar the name of a process , so shows you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines sent or created by this process . &quot;
&quot; this option is enabled in the default setting , and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . &quot;
&quot; if you want to show only certain processes ( for example in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can use the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this can , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Sam@@ ba server . in this case , use filter bar . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window pop @-@ up menu to view all new protocol @-@ lines . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows displaying multiple log files in separate sub @-@ windows . to use this function , use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional sub@@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a log to display in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. D@@ ort you will find further information about the reference sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion archive : k@@ system@@ log ; in &amp; k@@ de ; archive
&quot; welcome to &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , more known ( and so named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; &quot;
&quot; the V In@@ it System is rapidly becoming the standard for program start monitoring when running the system in the &amp; Linux world . and that &apos;s why , because it is easier to use , more powerful , and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD @-@ in@@ it . &quot;
I will not deal with historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V In@@ it without re@@ installing and format@@ ting . that &apos;s why you need to make sure that the old In@@ it was removed from there , if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it also differs from the BSD In@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is called r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it , and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; init@@ .@@ d contains a whole lot of scripts . basically you need a script for any system service you want to boot when running the system or when switching to another run@@ level . system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which will only start once . such calls go to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; you can also create a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to run a r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d , if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel searches in different places after the program in@@ it and starts the first one to find .
the standard run@@ level is entered in / etc / init@@ tab . you should see a line like the following :
&quot; at this point , you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default run@@ level 3 is . if you want to change it , then you can manually edit / etc / init@@ tab by hand and change the 3 . &quot;
&quot; but how does all the correct scripts start ? if you enter ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you &apos;ll probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that there are no real files in this folder . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that there is an argument like start and stop . you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if the one contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will start with the argument start . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; send@@ mail ; , network &amp; etc ; in addition , I could also have a user running level , the &amp; eg ; &amp; k@@ d@@ m ; , network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you learn how to use &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user @-@ friendly as possible .
using &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not tell tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six run@@ level to start it on this level ( or stop ) .
you can also move scripts between Run@@ level@@ n or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere . this will not happen if you extract an entry from the range of available system services .
&quot; note : entries are moved when you move them into a new area . to just copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or select from the context menu and insert into the destination area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the registration number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the Tab key to activate the different working areas ( Avail@@ able system services , run@@ level 1 start , run@@ level 1 stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous ones . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and insert it in the desired run@@ level with insert ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the key to open the Properties dialog . use the Tab key to switch between different fields . close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are saved in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . default settings are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if it is available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are saved in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level@@ n , and now the machine is constantly starting new . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO -@@ Pro@@ mp@@ t lin@@ ux single and press the input key to start in single user mode . then edit the / etc / init@@ tab file and change the standard run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have provided some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running on Run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
&quot; if you use Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) , you must edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution . &quot;
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . the authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using another distribution , please check if all configuration files are available which are needed by the system service ( and also if they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without message if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using another distribution , please send me information about the run@@ level so that this manual can be added . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to begin with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ ting from &amp; k@@ user ; to start reading .
&quot; after you have made changes , you will need to save it . either use the appropriate icon of the tool@@ bar or the Save in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ user ; is a simple application . the main window consists of two cards , the user name and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings . only when you activate space restrictions ( Qu@@ ota ) for users , a card card will be created where you can set individual settings . additional card cards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed like in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the card password management appears when shadow passwords or , for example , / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d as in BSD uni@@ xes are installed . &quot;
&quot; this card only appears , if at least one built @-@ in fil@@ esystem space limitation ( Qu@@ ota ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) . &quot;
these parameters can be set individually for each file system . the current file system is selected using the field file system with space limitation .
&quot; the groups , which belong to the user , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group field . furthermore , the user can be a member of other groups by selecting them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the dialog properties of the group contains a list of all users . to add a user to the group , select this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the User or Group menu , or click the Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group will work an@@ alog@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO Selec@@ tor , add , remove , and change the boot password , change the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change , and more . &quot;
