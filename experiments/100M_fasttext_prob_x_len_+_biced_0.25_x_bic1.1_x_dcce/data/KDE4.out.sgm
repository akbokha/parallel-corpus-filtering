<seg id="190">"the most common protection against spikes is an overvoltage protection. this is a device that absorbs a part of the energy slots and ends the rest. it is usually available in the form of a connector bar. remember, however, that not every connector bar also contains an overvoltage protection."</seg>

<seg id="192">"as an overvoltage of each cable can be used to your computer, you should make sure that all peripheral devices that are connected to your system are also protected. some manufacturers provide overvoltage shocks which also provide a telephone connection for your modem. others offer connectivity options for the coaxial cable of the cable modem and the TV card."</seg>
<seg id="193">"if you have a notebook, you will need a portable overvoltage protection. a variety of these devices are specially designed for notebooks and therefore very small and they also contain the protection for the modem."</seg>
<seg id="194">"while an overvoltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines, it will not really help you in a complete failure. even a failure of a few seconds can lead to the loss of irreplaceable data. it can therefore be useful to invest in uninterruptible power supply."</seg>
<seg id="195">"in addition to protecting against overvoltage, these devices can automatically provide battery power when a power outage occurs. this gives you the possibility to save your data and run the system in order. if you buy a UPS then you should be sure that they meet the same quality requirements as overvoltage protection. furthermore, the lifetime of the battery and the attached software is interesting."</seg>

<seg id="202">The diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer. all transmissions are susceptible to transmission errors. the file system ZFS and btrfs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive.</seg>
<seg id="203">"the worst thing about it is that nobody says you when a transmission error occurred, not when it happened in your hardware. all these disturbances remain undiscovered until one day you open a photo and this is destroyed to your surprise. no one seems to have ever thought of it. the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than the one in your computer."</seg>
<seg id="204">"unreliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses, since they generate interferences within the data streams. for normal filesystems these errors remain unnoticed."</seg>

<seg id="213">Sensors of digital cameras are 1-2 lens settings of fundamental physical limits. this means that while the technology is further developed there is a natural limit for this progress. sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far from this limit.</seg>

<seg id="217">"a disaster strikes locally and destroys a lot. forget: fire, water, electricity, children and thieves are dangerous for your data. they usually affect a whole room or the entire house."</seg>
<seg id="218">"therefore, disaster prevention is always a non-local storage. bring your backups up the stairs, into the neighboring house, into your office or similar."</seg>
<seg id="219">"there is another advantage of physical separation: as already said above, there is a common reason for a data loss despite securing the panic. if you have a backup that is not immediately available, then you can save that one day."</seg>
<seg id="220">Complete backup: a complete backup of all files to be backed up. it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time.</seg>
<seg id="221">Differential lock: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup. generates a complete snapshot of two time points: the complete assurance and the last differential lock.</seg>
<seg id="222">Incremental backup: a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup. produces multiple snapshots. you can restore the original status at any time when such backup is made. this backup comes with an exemption system closest to the exception that it is only scanned and not continuous.</seg>
<seg id="223">Rsync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines. unlike script-controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfer scripts rsync only copies the difference of files that have actually been changed. this happens compressed and if you want to increase security over ssh.</seg>

<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or change to open standards which are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone today. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures then keep it up and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">"on the other hand, the Council is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, your memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards."</seg>
<seg id="232">Scalability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size. this actually means increasing.</seg>
<seg id="233">Let's assume that you have set the scalability with you and the area you want to enlarge on a dedicated disk or partition. at * nix systems like & Linux; you can copy this area and store it on a new disk:</seg>

<seg id="237">"GIF is a proprietary, patented format that slowly disappears from the market. therefore, you should not use it any more."</seg>
<seg id="238">"it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG can store gamma- and chromaticity data for improved color assignment at heterogeneous platforms. the disadvantage is that it requires relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and has a slow compression."</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with loss-free compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images of high quality but requires very large files.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a license-free and open blank format that was developed by Adobe Systems. DNG is developed on the basis of the need to standardise camera captions. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to use metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers are already at your disposal and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon also use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">"this is possibly one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe has introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; image resource block" technology of the nineties. XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. "</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers prefer an original of your recording, mostly in raw format, to archive. XMP fits as it stores metadata separately from the image file. however, you should consider if you use DNG as a container and put everything together."</seg>
<seg id="243">"the Dublin Core Metadata Initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards supporting a wide range of applications and business models. DCMI activities include workshops, discussions and collaborative work in the DCMI communities and DCMI working groups, annual conferences and workshops, standard links and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices."</seg>
<seg id="244">"import pictures from the camera, the card reader or the scanner. as long as the pictures are on the camera folder, you can use it as a temporary backup."</seg>

<seg id="301">"the default is that all green pixels are the same. if the straight green pixels of the CCD sensor react more sensitive to ultraviolet light than the pixels on odd lines, this difference produces a mesh pattern in the output. this option draws the image slightly soft, but eliminates the 2x2 grid pattern with the VNG- or AHD quality method."</seg>
<seg id="302">"if this option is set, the white balance of the camera is used. otherwise, if set, the automatic ink balance is used."</seg>
<seg id="303">This setting is only used if the white balance is not set. standard is to use a fixed color balance based on a white card that was photographed in sunlight.</seg>
<seg id="304">This setting is supported only for Fuji Super CCD SLR cameras. using the second sensors has the effect that underexposed images in four steps get more details in the top lights. for other cameras this option is ignored.</seg>
<seg id="305">"the default is the top lights, so the parts of your images that are burned with, due to the inability of your camera to catch the top lights as penetrating white. use the setting of continuous white in the settings. the setting colors trigger some unusual results as it shows the pointed-lights in various Rosatönen. finally, you can attempt to reconstruct some parts of the missing information from the top lights."</seg>
<seg id="306">This is possible because blue pixels generally do not saturate as fast as green and red. & digikam; and dcrap therefore try to reconstruct the missing green and red portions of the still unsaturated blue pixels. of course this is a question of how much color or white you want.</seg>
<seg id="307">"if you select the option reconstruct, you get the possibility to set a level. here, a value of three is a compromise and can / should be adjusted individually for each image."</seg>

<seg id="318">"there are other options like the Soft-Proof-Profile, which you can emulate as your image would be returned from one device. this is very useful before you print a picture, because your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors may therefore be very saturated. this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer."</seg>

<seg id="377">The reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed and scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow you can achieve that the colors on your monitor match those of your camera or scanner and that the colors that you print or publish on the web from your digital darkroom.</seg>
<seg id="378">"if the theme is on color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he has to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, colour management means that you make informed decisions at any point of the image processing workflows."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections, which can improve an image in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions Normalize, synchronize, automatic matching and contrast are added from the Edit Automatic correction menu try to make the best out of your colors. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">"normalize: this method scales the luminous intensity over the entire image, so that the darkest point black and the brightest point is as bright as possible without changing its color shade. this function is often a magical correction for images that are dark or full-washed."</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method adjusts the brightness of the color of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel is as flat as possible. sometimes the matching very good results in improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces very good results in the improvement of the contrast of an image, sometimes it also produces rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic matching: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel. it detects the dark and light border tones and adjusts the red, green and blue channels to the complete histogram region."</seg>
<seg id="393">"contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by moving the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible area and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible when images are washed, and can be a good correction for bad photos."</seg>
<seg id="394">White balance of & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to carry out the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is a little limited because of a color space with 8-bit per color. so if you can be too far away from the original picture, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in rough mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your chances of correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start it via the menu item paints white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left hand side, both the original picture and the preview of the target picture can be seen. the preview is dynamically adapted to the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, it is enough to click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target picture has a red marker. the Luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"on the top right, a histogram is shown to change dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well lit images, most pixels have very small luminance values."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or trim the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use selected color for calculating the color temperature of the white balance. this way also the temperature and green values are set automatically."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance with the list of default settings. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The overexposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will get the combined result in white balance. this is shown in the preview as pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">"the buttons save as and load exactly this. every setting of the white balance that you have set, you can save it to a text file and load later."</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button reverts all the filter values back to their default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that even neutral settings will result in a different picture than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"you can adjust the coding depth for each color channel of the processed image here. 8-bit encoding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this encoding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as for the processing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles. color mapping can be performed by the subwindow for the brightness settings. a detailed instructions for using color profiles can be consulted in the chapter Color Management.</seg>
<seg id="408">"this tool provides an integrated way to adjust several color channels at the same time. this is useful if your camera or scanner always makes the same mistake, so you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under color gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the & digicam; tool color effects provide you with four color effects, a solar isolation effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a edge filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, Solarisation was also known as Sabatier, an effect that arose when a partially developed print was replaced by a short flash light and then completed the development of the image. the coloured, darker areas protected the sensitive photopaper from the additional light."</seg>
<seg id="412">"the intensity controls the ionization. at approx. 50% intensity, the picture shows what is chemically possible. a further upliftment ultimately creates a negative image that does not produce photographic paper."</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the solar system effect. the original image is the (1) and this is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the vivid filter simulates the so-called" "Velviaquoth" "effect. it differs from saturation by making a stronger contrast effect that makes the colors brilliant and glowing. try it simple, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted colour film made by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediterrot; and thus a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts. Velvia offers very saturated colours in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">"the neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeat the strength of the neon light. in large images, the filter can load the entire CPU for a moment."</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with lighting conditions and it is not uncommon that you want to correct the color contrast and brightness of the photo. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photos with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview. once you are satisfied with the result use the button Ok and you will be applied.</seg>
<seg id="418">If you can make a photo in poor lighting conditions you can get the reverse problem: a too big saturation. also in this case the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation instead of increasing it. if you like the result you can confirm the changes with Ok.</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex mold gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is set to improve the exposure. even if the dialog has a very complicated effect on this tool, you only need the range of the slider for the use purpose described here. concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. under the graph, three sliders are clicked into them and which can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn how to operate it is to move the regulator and watch out how the image changes.</seg>

<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools for sharpening. each of you has advantages in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy to create, but especially in dark areas, grainy pictures."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurry mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper look. in fact, it sharpens not a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric vapor and it makes a really good job here."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocus is possibly the best of the three since it really improves sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has different parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">"images without focus, as well as most digitized images need a correction of the sharpness. this is because the digitalization process needs to be combined with only minimal differences to one color point. this, in turn, causes sharp edges to be printed on paper. SLR cameras usually require more subsequent sharpening than normal cameras for private users."</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG pictures, a camera is often used for internal sharpness. images in rough format, on the other hand, must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a focus filter while reading the image. if you disable this, you will get control of your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">"in some situations, you can obtain useful results by sharpening a photo with the sharpening tool. you can use the menu entry for correcting sharpenings."</seg>
<seg id="487">"you should handle it carefully, as the results do not work very naturally: sharpening increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies noise. in general, the most useful technique to sharpen an image can refocus the tool."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the image a bit softly is much easier than to sharpen it. use the tool to draw a soft sign with the menu entry Corrigible soft drawing and experiment something with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often generate good results and should be tried first. an increase in the radius or the amount intensifies the effect. if you make the blurred mask too strong, noise and impression of grenades are generated near sharp edges."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels are affected on each side of an edge through the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii.</seg>
<seg id="493">The amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image that is added to the original. thereby the strength of the sharpness is set.</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the applicable difference amount. thus, it is possible to define a minimum difference in this way for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between tones are excluded from sharpness and therefore avoid beauty errors in faces, skies and water surfaces."</seg>
<seg id="495">"this is an example of the blurred filter. the original image is the (1) and the processed image the (2). blurred mask was applied with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicam; tool refocus refocused a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted Entfaltungs-Filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. this is better approach than trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener filtering.</seg>
<seg id="498">"in practice, the circular cleavage works much better than the Gauß's folding. the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which causes the mathematical result to be influenced by the source pixellates too far from the original pixel."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of circular splitting. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most pictures, the default value should result in good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation can help to reduce artifacts. the correlation can be selected from 0-1. usable values are 0.5 and the values close to 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharpening effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filters: an increase of the noise filter can help you to reduce artifacts. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, the image quality is very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"Gauss's sharpness: this is the radius for the Gauss's sharpness. use this parameter if your blurry is correct. in most cases, you should have this value to 0 to avoid annoying artefacts. if you use a value unequal zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase of the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select great values for the circular sharpness or the gauge's sharpness."</seg>
<seg id="504">Save as and load buttons are used exactly for this purpose. any refocus parameter you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before you change the picture otherwise. the reason for this is that a lot of operations changes that are not immediately visible, but then leave unpleasant artifacts later."</seg>
<seg id="507">"if you read and compress images, eg; as JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally unsharp masks produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by the unsharp mask of a larger neighborhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, unsharp masks always have to create artefacts. even under optimal conditions it is impossible to remove the effect of blurring. the result of the FIR Viennese filter is always at least as good as the sharpness mask. the FIR Viennese filter is often better in processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">This picture has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the car focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">"for more information on the field correction methods in digital pictures, you can read a technical comparison in English under this address."</seg>
<seg id="513">The knob smoothes the sharpness of the area that was darkened in order to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink-ink allows a modified color for the pupil. if you want blue eyes instead of dark ones, then you can adjust it here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most advanced tools to remove unwanted artefacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains different presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings fine, you can use the tabs smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detail conservation p [0, 100]: this controls the preservation of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the picture. a value of 0.9 should be maintained in such a way that no sharpening should be necessary retrospectively."</seg>
<seg id="520">"alignment dependence Alpha [0,100]: a small value smoothes evenly in all directions, while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film grading or CCD noise, a high value will produce wave-like patterns. JPEG artefacts are best eliminated at a value near 1."</seg>
<seg id="521">"flatten [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above alles. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">"repetitions: specifies how often the algorithm is passed. normally, 1 or 2 is enough."</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle step-up da [5, 90]: angle dependent integration of the anisotropic Alpha. if alpha is selected small, you should also choose small angles for a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable to your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integrated stride length [0,1, 10]: integral step width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never larger than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more of the quality that you receive by selecting this option is only low. it doubles the runtime. we therefore recommend it to allow it.</seg>
<seg id="527">"the buttons save as and load exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file, and later loaded."</seg>
<seg id="528">"it can take a long time and load a high CPU load, so you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="529">The module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City using an analog camera. as you can see there is a peculiar black artefact in the foreground that caused by a bad film deposit during the trip.</seg>
<seg id="530">The & digicam; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce image noise. it uses a copyrighted algorithm by Peter Heckert.</seg>
<seg id="531">"this tool provides selectable image filters to remove stains and other artefacts, e.g. from dust or hair on the lens. it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or moireacute; effects of scanned images from books or magazines."</seg>
<seg id="532">"if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras, you can read them in English in this tutorial."</seg>
<seg id="533">The screenshot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity. it shows a grainy noise that can be successfully removed with this tool.</seg>
<seg id="534">"the following is a complete description of all parameters. in most cases, you only need the subwindow details and the Advanced settings window will remain with the default settings."</seg>
<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter is used per pixel and can blurred the image."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing that the filter looks forward to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details can no longer be preserved and noise or lubrication occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"edges: controls edge accuracy for the sharpness. this value improves the filter frequency response. if it is too strong, the entire noise can be removed or noise tips can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend either change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the gameplay tolerance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of the darker areas, which are typically roughened more strongly. however, it also lubricates the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"attenuation: controls the alignment of the phase jitter attenuation. this value defines how fast the adaptive filtering radius responds to variations of the luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high."</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and Load: these buttons are used precisely for this. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">"the solution to draw the image a little bit softly is fortunately much easier than a picture to sharpen. use tool to soften the image with the menu entry Corrigible soft drawing and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo."</seg>
<seg id="545">The & digicam; photo Restoration is definitely one of the most developed tools to reduce photo artefacts.</seg>
<seg id="546">"the restoration gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted artefacts from your images. it is very well adapted to remove Gauß's noise, film graining, scratches, compression artifacts and local errors that appear in digital, original or subsequently digitalized images."</seg>
<seg id="547">"the same algorithm can be used for color and texture creation. the texture composition is performed using a different tool, the image error correction. the algorithm for restoration was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS Labors in Caen / Frans and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="548">JPEG Artefacts reduce: compression of JPEG is not perfect in some areas even very far from it. as a lossy compression algorithm it produces some compression & quot; Artefactequot; - small standards that can be seen in uncompressed image. this setting should correct these problems.</seg>
<seg id="549">"the buttons save as and load exactly this. any setting of photo-restoration can be saved to a text file, and later loaded."</seg>
<seg id="550">"photo-restoration is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a long time and pull up a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish."</seg>
<seg id="551">Below you can reduce like a photo with uniform noise. the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Minolta (tm) HP-5 film with a sensitivity of 3200 ISO. you can see the infamous film grain on the faces. the original picture is below (1) and the corrected unter (2).</seg>
<seg id="552">Below you can see another example of the photo restoration. this time textures were reduced to an old color photo that was scanned with a scanner. you can see the scan artifacts which were created by the scanner lighting and the photo paper. the original picture is shown below (1) and the corrected picture below (2).</seg>

<seg id="554">"bright, dead or hot pixels are a problem especially for high-quality raw-mode photos as many cameras with JPEG compression have a built-in suppression for hot pixels."</seg>
<seg id="555">This tool can be used to remove & quot; hot pixelquot; and 'bright pixelquot; on a photo with a dark image extraction method. there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels.</seg>
<seg id="556">Download this file in the wizard with the Dark Image button. the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels. these are highlighted in the image preview.</seg>
<seg id="557">"if you have an old digital camera, it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels with CCD defects."</seg>
<seg id="558">"first, as described in the previous section, you should find the matching dark image to the image to be corrected. an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels. note that the Wizard notices the last dark image and recharges it automatically in the next session."</seg>

<seg id="560">Select an area to preview the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter. then select the best filter method to interpolate these pixel blocks. these are the available filters:</seg>
<seg id="561">"average: an average of neighbouring pixels is determined. the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block. for a 1-dimensional interpolation, this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line."</seg>
<seg id="562">Linear: all pixels that have a distance of 1 of the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi-linear interface (2-dim) or a group of linear curves (1-dim). these are then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="563">Square: this is the default filter method. all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to the pixel block are drawn to calculate a bi-quadratic surface (2-dim) or a group of square curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="564">Cubic: all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to calculate a bi-cubic surface (2-dim) or a group of cubic curves (1-dim) which is then used to interpolate the defective pixels in the block.</seg>
<seg id="565">"below you can see the Hotpixel correction on a color photo, from a defective digital camera with a sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure, applied. the original image has been enlarged to 300% (1) and the corrected picture is visible under (2)."</seg>
<seg id="566">"the & digicam; Vignetting correction is a tool to correct the vignetting, i.e. underexposed corners, of an image."</seg>
<seg id="567">"wide-angle lenses, especially those in medium and large photo format, can often not illuminate the entire sensor area. instead, they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that the sensor reaches there. telephoto lenses may also show this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="568">"many center filters need a factor 1.5 or 2 in the f-stop filter, which increases the necessary shutter speed under certain circumstances, which makes it impossible to use the camera with the hand. wide-angle lenses should also be used with center filters, an opening of f / 16 or smaller, since otherwise blurred effects are caused by movement."</seg>
<seg id="569">"with the large exposure areas of today's felt and the color or grayscale of digital cameras and film scanners, it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equivalent transformation on a raw image that was done without this filter. the tool Vignetting correction applies the transformation with a center filter on a picture. the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker."</seg>
<seg id="570">"with three regulators, you can control the vignetting correction filter and with three further exposure of the target image."</seg>
<seg id="571">"density: this parameter controls the degree of light power attenuation at the point of the largest density filter. the standard density is 2.0, resulting in an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1, or by randomly a light intensity of 2,. increase the density to compensate for a larger degree of vignetting, reduce it by a small degree."</seg>
<seg id="572">"luminous intensity, contrast and gamma settings: editing an image with the vignetting correction reduces the brightness of the pixels. you only need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options."</seg>

<seg id="579">The coefficient fourth degree corrects the remote corners opposed to that of the second degree. if you combine these two can virtually eliminate any geometric distortion.</seg>
<seg id="580">In general: this value controls the strength of distortion second degree. negative values can be corrected without distortion and positive values cushion distortion.</seg>
<seg id="581">"corner: this value controls the thickness of the distortion of the fourth grade. this value works more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture. for most lenses, the 'Corner Parameters' has the opposite character of the General parameter."</seg>
<seg id="582">Zoom: this value resumes the image size and thereby performs a correction of the first degree. negative values increase while positive image size decreases.</seg>
<seg id="583">"bright: this value adjusts the brightness in the corners of the image. negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners, while positive values increase it."</seg>
<seg id="584">"to help you find the best filter settings, the dialog with a Preview Preview illustrates the distortion correction. the values you use for your image are saved and used for the next start as default values."</seg>
<seg id="585">"the pitch or cushion distortion should be performed prior to all trimming or size changes. ideally, perform this correction as the first one. if you want to cut a picture anew and then perform a spherical correction, the effect would be apparent to the wrong."</seg>
<seg id="586">"to help you find the best correction, this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal aid line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to display the dotted lines."</seg>

<seg id="592">"below the Preview, you can set two parameters setting motion capture and film sensitivity (ISO). activate the option Funge film grading if you want to simulate the grainy texture of a highly sensitive film. the ISO regulator changes the amount of film graining and the dominance of color green (chlorophyll in nature) in transformation. green meadows are white like snow!"</seg>
<seg id="593">"since the filter color channels are mixed to reproduce infrared film, especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect to black / white photos as the color information is missing."</seg>
<seg id="594">This is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand. the original image is set under (1) and the processed image below (2). the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400. higher ISO values produce a kind of aura in the top lights.</seg>
<seg id="595">"this is known by classic high-speed films such as the B / W Kodak Tri-X. to increase the sensitivity of the films, the manufacturers mix big silver grains of photoemulsion."</seg>
<seg id="596">"the film grazing effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to move back into the past. the treated image gets a timeless atmosphere detached from everyday life. if you want this special, gallery-like, street photographic, grainy sight especially in your monochrome photos, you need to use this filter."</seg>
<seg id="597">"with the regulator, the ISO sensitivity can be calibrated to control the intensity and granularity of the grains. the default value is, although often higher values are required, on ISO-2400. if you need more grains, you can apply the filter several times."</seg>

<seg id="617">Distance blurr: blurring the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object seems to come back into the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"blurring: blurring the image through horizontal movements of the pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train taking photos, camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">"soft marker: blurred the image softly in the dark and strong in bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow."</seg>
<seg id="620">Shredder sharpness: blurred the image through random shift of pixels and thereby simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blurring: finds the colour basins in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">"mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, by filling with an average pixel value."</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects require a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load. therefore you can cancel this calculation at any time with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="624">The raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your image. this gives it natural to your pictures a wet look. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of the drops. since the droplet size does not grow automatically with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce size for small images. number changes the number and density of drops. fish eyes change the visual effect of drops on the picture.</seg>
<seg id="626">"you can choose with the digicam; image processing a area free of raindrops. use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you then start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the Regentropfen filter. the original image (1) shows a quiet sunset and the processed image (2) suggests a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>
<seg id="628">"if the photo has the wrong orientation, you can bring it through mirroring or turning into the right orientation."</seg>
<seg id="629">"photo magnification is definitely one of the most developed tools to enlarge a photo, with minimal loss of image quality."</seg>
<seg id="630">The big question is how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture when the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you re-invent or guess the missing information? the CImg algorithm that is used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="631">If a photo has the wrong size you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size change. choose to change size change in the menu and specify the target values. the dialog can be seen below.</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool to change size uses a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with better quality, then try the tool for inflating."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many image processing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. Spline Interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digikam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo bubbles was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You need to tell the tool how to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"preserve aspect ratio: if this setting is enabled, the aspect ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary if very much noise is present, since it is difficult to generate the geometry of the image. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the buttons save as and load are used exactly for this. enlarge each collection for photos, can be saved as a text file and later recharged."</seg>
<seg id="638">"inflating the photo is very fast with what it does, but it can take a long time and pull up a high CPU load. you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish."</seg>
<seg id="639">You can see below an example of a photo magnified by adding a small color image to the double size. the original is (1) and the enlarged picture (3). the preview (2) is the result of linear expansion to compare.</seg>
<seg id="640">"cutting of a photo is not only a frequently performed surgery, but also a frequently underestimated tool to assemble a picture. to cut a photo you simply need to use the mouse just the rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle. you will then see this rectangle while you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">When you release the mouse button again the area of the photo will be cut off. you can change the size of the area to be clipped by dragging at the corners of the rectangle. a new rectangle can be created by simply using the left mouse button.</seg>
<seg id="642">"once you are satisfied with the cut, use the button View button of image editing in the toolbar and the photo is cut (Ctrl + + X)."</seg>
<seg id="643">"in the preview area, you can change the size of the rectangle by moving the corners with the mouse. the aspect ratio that you have defined in the dialog remains intact."</seg>
<seg id="644">"in the tool After aspect ratio, you can specify orientation as portrait or landscape format. in high-format, the larger value of the height and in the cross format of the width is assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"the tool After aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeters, inches or any other physical size. you can see for example below a list of traditional sizes for photopaper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"at the bottom of the dialog, you can set the area to the greatest possible depending on the chosen relationship and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"when you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are displayed as default values depending on orientation. the changed image dimensions are stored in the EXIF tables, so that EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">The settings of the cooperation help make it possible to hide help so that you can put together your images better. these help are:</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonic triangle: harmonic divides are based on the principle of similarity. like the third-elbow, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonious triangles on the diagonal."</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden centre: the golden centre is a division of different natural growth patterns, such as the spiral of a Nautilus shell or the leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all sorts of things that we feel as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden division is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks to construct their temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden ratio in all times when you put together your images, buildings and even photos to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from the Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc; the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden middle."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden centre provides smoother auxiliary lines if you put together a picture. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden spiral will bring you closer to your goal to achieve good results for your photos. compared to the third-level rule, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the picture. this kind of composition leads the viewer's gaze along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetrical visual flow."</seg>
<seg id="656">"another rule is the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral. it should be something that the eye is at the center of the composition. this can be a line or different objects."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the Golden Triangles also derive from the above-discussed golden spiral. your vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not contra-angled triangles. diagonal to place these lines can let a static object appear more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">If you use golden triangles to break your frame you create an effect of professional photographers called dynamic symmetry. try to place your focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you can't achieve.</seg>
<seg id="659">The Horizontal mirror and vertices options can be used to mirror the harmonic divisions.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the Color button, you can set the color of the help lines. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. in this way you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The Free Rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"when you make a photo, it's easy that you don't hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this with the digicam; image processing and the tool free rotation. choose to transform Free Rotation and adjust the target angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider corner. the values on this slider are indicated in degrees. with the button Preferences you can reset the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the picture are displayed on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">"after you have turned a picture, you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair this is to use the function Transforming trimming from image processing."</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to trim the image is the Automatically cut function. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">"the anti-aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after rotation, but note the above warning."</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are carried out by a fixed point to the so-called reference point. this point is shown in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. you will then automatically recompute the preview. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>
<seg id="670">"new width: displays the width of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="671">"new height: displays the height of the new image, including the empty areas created by the transformation, in pixels."</seg>
<seg id="672">Left corner: displays the current angle in degrees at the top left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="673">Angle right above: displays the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="674">Angle left below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower left corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="675">Angle right below: displays the current angle in degrees at the lower right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective the image becomes a little blurred. for a single adjustment this effect is small, but two adjustments generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you adapted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean this is to cut the image with transformations from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"the tool is used to postpone part of the image in one direction and move the other part into the opposite. this is not rotation, the image is distorted. in other words, a rectangle is turned into a parallelogram. you can start this module about transforming scissors."</seg>
<seg id="679">"rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angles. if you press presets, the angles are reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be shown to you and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed to the right of the preview pane."</seg>
<seg id="680">"move the mouse to an important point, such as the lake, a wall from a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines. you can now use the tool to adjust your image."</seg>
<seg id="681">"after you have done the shearing, the image is wiped a bit. for a single shearing this effect is usually negligible, but two reinforcements producing twice as much blurring and therefore you should avoid this."</seg>
<seg id="682">"after the shearing, the image has triangular holes in the corners. one way to eliminate it is to cut the image with transformations from the image processing."</seg>
<seg id="683">"& digicam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, from the way these libraries are compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats with & digicam;"</seg>

<seg id="920">"next, select if a & kphotoalbum; export file is to be created on the overview page."</seg>
<seg id="921">"last but not least, you can select which information to be displayed on the HTML pages. this allows you to avoid that information displayed to the viewer is obvious. for example, all pictures of a party are visible."</seg>
<seg id="922">"in this section, you can specify how the HTML pages should look like. most settings are unique, which is why this is not specifically addressed."</seg>
<seg id="923">"at the bottom of the page you can set various resolutions for the images. thus, those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800x600, no longer download images which have for example a resolution of 1600x1200."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the viewer of your page can change the resolution at any time you have defined. so, you can browse your images with low resolution, which leads to a lower transfer time. if you want to get an image larger, it changes to a higher resolution."</seg>
<seg id="925">"in this setup area, place the different folders and the URL where your website is stored."</seg>
<seg id="926">"best, select a base folder for all your HTML files and a new subfolder for each subsequent set."</seg>
<seg id="927">"first you need to select the main folder in which all your images are saved. this folder will be saved and automatically added next time. this allows you to select either a folder or a protocol supported by KDE, for example:"</seg>
<seg id="928">"after you have created your images, you can check if they are really all visible to viewers. if you select a URL for the base folder, a web browser will be launched after the pages are created. otherwise, the web browser will start in the wrong folder."</seg>
<seg id="929">"if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder, you have to manually copy them there. so that the import function, see, correctly, you must specify the final destination of the files. this is not the subfolder of the current files, but the base folder in which all subfolders are located."</seg>
<seg id="930">"the settings you have just described have moved all three to base folders or URLs. in these, a subfolder is created, whose name you specify in output folders."</seg>
<seg id="931">"if you are on a family celebration, a meeting in the company, a conference or anywhere else, with other users of & kphotoalbum; coming together, you may want to create a HTML page for viewing the pictures."</seg>
<seg id="932">With & kphotoalbum; you can export a copy of your images to a .kim file. these can import others into your database. the image properties are ex- and imported.</seg>
<seg id="933">"there are two different types of .kim files, internal and external. they differ in whether the images themselves are stored in the file or if the file is only a link to images. the advantage of saving all images in the file is that you can get all the images together and share this file so independently. however, the obvious disadvantage is the file size."</seg>
<seg id="934">"you can create a .kim file either directly from the File Exporting... or along with HTML pages, see, create. if you create a .kim file together with an HTML file, this will be an external .kin file."</seg>
<seg id="935">"an external .kin file searches the images in a two-fold way. first, it searches the images that are located in the file of the .kim file. if the corresponding images are not found, the images of the URL you've specified when creating HTML files will only be possible if you have created your .kim file by means of HTML export."</seg>
<seg id="936">"in the following, the dialog for exporting images is described, which you can access via the File Exporting..."</seg>
<seg id="937">The most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .kin files. the following three choices are available:</seg>
<seg id="938">"if you want to copy the manual to the .kim file, you will need to copy the images to the same folder as the .kim file."</seg>
<seg id="939">Copy & kphotoalbum with the Automatically Copy option near the .kim file; the images automatically for you.</seg>
<seg id="940">.kim files are normal zip files. since most images have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worthwhile to compress the files.</seg>
<seg id="941">"the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size. if you send pictures to your friends, you might not want to send the images in full size, because the .kim file would otherwise be very big."</seg>
<seg id="942">"if you select a file with the extension .kin from the web browser or from the File Importing... select, will import & kphotoalbum; the exported database as described in described."</seg>
<seg id="943">"the wizard for importing consists of four steps. first, you need to select which images you want to import, then, in which folders the import pictures should be copied."</seg>
<seg id="944">"it may be that you personalize the category Persons of the file to be imported (if you are a domain), while this category is called persons in your database. therefore, you will be asked in the third dialog window which categories of the imported file should be imported and which categories these are in your database."</seg>
<seg id="945">"in the fourth step, you can compare the categories of the file to be imported with the categories of your current database. for example, see the picture."</seg>
<seg id="946">"it must be easy to browse and view images: if you look at pictures, you often want to jump within different picture groups. for example, if you look at pictures of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend, you might want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted."</seg>

<seg id="960">"the applications that use the modules over KIPI are very different, making it possible that some modules with & kphotoalbums do not work. this is the disadvantage when sharing features with different applications."</seg>
<seg id="961">"the biggest difference between & kphotoalbum; and other applications, which also use KIPI, is that the other applications do not support their images in albums: this kind of order does not support, simulate it for some modules the order for albums so that you can use the functions with a photoalbum."</seg>

<seg id="1045">"& Povray; supports two methods of super-sampling. as a standard, an adaptive, non-recursive method; the second method is adaptive-recursive; recursively because each pixel is constantly redistributed and adaptively, because each pixel depends on the calculated color values."</seg>
<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray follows a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels passes the given threshold, then both pixels are calculated by tracking a particular additional number of pixels with super-sampling. if you set the depth value to 4, a grid of 4 will be calculated with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional beams per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>
<seg id="1049">"the recursive method starts with 4 beams per pixel. if the difference between the color values exceeds the default threshold, the pixel will be divided into 4 sub-pixels that are individually pursued and tested for further subdivisions. the maximum depth of the recursion can be set with the depth value."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"another way to reduce the aliasing effect is the creation of noise for the ray process called Jittering. if you switch Jittering, change & Povray; the rays around a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns."</seg>
<seg id="1051">The last setting for the quality of Renderns is diffuse reflection. this is an experimental property of & Povray; it takes a very long time to calculate a scene with this property.</seg>

<seg id="1519">A short list of parameters for audio quality and resulting compression rates for 'lame' (MP3s) (see 'lame --help' for further parameters):</seg>
<seg id="1520">'--preset medium '= This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music</seg>
<seg id="1521">"--preset standard '= This setting should usually offer most people and most music-acceptable transparency, and has quite high quality. good enough for hi-fi hi-fi systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"--preset extreme '= 224 to 256 kbps VBR, compression rate up to 6.3. needs up to 320 kbps for complex music pieces and a little less for less complex parts of the piece. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality. this is the preferred choice."</seg>
<seg id="1523">"--preset extreme -b 256 '= 256 kbps CBR, compression rate about 5.5. always needs 256 kbps for complex and less complex pieces of a title. some older devices need CBRs. good enough for hi-fi stereo systems with high quality."</seg>
<seg id="1524">"-h '= 128 kbps CBR common stereo, compression rate about 11 128 kbps for all pieces of a title. good pleasure for music of young people, portable devices and car stereo systems. but not good enough for better hi-fi stereo systems."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"--preset Insane '= 320kbps CBR. this setting will be overdone for most people and most environments, but if you absolutely want the absolute highest quality without regard to the file size, then choose this setting."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"the & CD; information that is entered manually or fetched through the program automatically from the freedb via the Internet, are available in the program as a list of parameters. you can commit / used with & kaudiocreator; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files."</seg>
<seg id="1527">"in connection with encoding programs, there is often a combination of program settings for the encoder and these parameters here. the manual or the help to the encoders explain the switches for these programs."</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for example, to add the title to the keywords (English: tag) when MP3s are encoded with lame, the switch -tt of lame and the title parameters of & kaudiocreator must be added. the result looks like this: '... -tt {title}...'."</seg>
<seg id="1529">This is a summary of & kaudiocreator; parameters that can be used (= button name in the wizard):</seg>
<seg id="1530">"it's what the freedb is: a free database where people can read the audio CDs that you can download / enter, so that all others can download this information instead of entering into the computer. it's worth noting that here only text is spoken: & CD; Title, artist, names of pieces & etc;, not from the audio file itself."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"yes, it should be legal, but I (note of the translator) is not a lawyer. however, no one can prevent you from being wronged by the CD; information publicly available on the CD; more or less worthless, so neither the artist nor the music company can get hurt."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"in & kaudiocreator; actively use a check box (sending an address). in this type of configuration, it seems, the e-mail address will not be used when retrieving the data from the server (This can only know the programmer who has checked the code.)"</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there are copies of the main database in many countries. if & kaudiocreator; to use freedb, the geographically closest mirror server should be used. this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts."</seg>
<seg id="1534">A visit to freedb.org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retrieval of & CD; information during reading a & CD;. alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or (usually created monthly) just updates of the database.</seg>
<seg id="1535">Which selection program is used to save pieces from the & CD; to store in wav files on my computer?</seg>
<seg id="1536">"there are rumours that cdparanoia is used; those who want to know more precisely, search in the source code.... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD; see note that the cdparanoia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed if this hasn't happened yet."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"to save the read wav files, the encoder and thus the desired file format can be selected. at the first opening you find pre-defined entries for lame (MP3s), oggenc (Oggs) and FLAC (lossless compression for audio data) on the tab card to set the encoder."</seg>
<seg id="1538">The Kodiver package must be installed from the Linux distribution before the encoder can be used. this is also required for the predefined encoder. more information about Kodierer are in the chapter Welcher Kodierer.</seg>
<seg id="1539">"after installing a encoder, you can get more information about his switches by entering a command such as lame -help or lame --help in a console window (eg; console)."</seg>
<seg id="1540">"check the setup of the device name of the & CD; / DVD drive, the write and reading real on it and whether cdparanoia as well as the audio encoders of your choice (lame for MP3s, oggenc for Oggs, flac & etc;)."</seg>

<seg id="1543">"have you read the complete manual, understood everything, but are somehow still unsure what to do? well, no problem, follow this step-by-step example, and you will get enough information to set up those areas that let the program do exactly what you want."</seg>
<seg id="1544">"in this example, we will start the program for the first time, set up everything and read our first & CD; we will use lame '--preset extreme' to generate MP3s with a VBR (variable bitrate) from 224 to 256 kbps in average and ID3V1 keywords (tags)."</seg>
<seg id="1545">"you must have cdparanoia and lame already installed on your computer. both programs should be available as pre-compiled packages for your Linux distribution. a suitable package for lame can be found, for example, with a search engine, as it is considered non-free software. anyway, it is not necessary to compile the source files, which you can of course always do."</seg>

<seg id="1663">"the optional AllKeysTo M is used to put all the sounds that this instrument needs to place on the sound with the number M. if your keyboard is not supported for example (GM-Patch 127), you can take a drum (e.g. with sound 60), which sounds similar to a gun shot."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"so, if a MIDI file is supposed to play a note with Patch 127 (defenses), it takes about 100 (the drum on your keyboard) and plays the sound 60, regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file."</seg>

<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the keymap option, the keymap will be used with the name name for this channel. if you use the Keymap option, all events will be ignored which try to change the patch on this channel. in this case, patch x will always be used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"the ForcePatch option can be useful, for example, to always use the percussions patch on the percussions channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio Pitch Bender events are multiplied. if a MIDI file sends a Pitch Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file there are no decimal commas."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM imagines that a keyboard, which is a pitch-benefit event with the value 4096, should play a sound higher. unfortunately, however, some keyboards try to play two tones up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI Settings dialog. you can find it in the menu under Settings, Point MIDI Settings"</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see which sounds are played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel, there is a selection list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the knob does not light green, but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">The channel view has (up to now) two different views to display the played sounds. view the View menu in the View menu on channel view: settings</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD displays the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the bigger the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. so, for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the lyrics, you can slow it down. to change the tempo, use the arrows to the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file containing information about how a piece of music must be played. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc; this can lead the same MIDI file on two different devices to very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"good, I can't force anyone to use & kmid; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you can also change the individual instruments, speed & etc; you have control over everything."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid has been compiled without AWE support. to eliminate the problem you need to download and install a source distribution (for example from kmid; 's start page)"</seg>

<seg id="1729">"since the KMPlayer's VDR support can only use XVideo, XVideo should also work (probably this type of playback of video devices under Linux is the only one that works). therefore, the XFree86 server must be able to do the following in its configuration file (/ etc / X11 / XF86Config)."</seg>

<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are available for everyone who uses & quantaplus. all that is known as global is stored in the common folder structure of & quantaplus. this allows the group of administrators to secure various toolbars, actions and patterns in a global tree that will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development resources for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">"project-related elements are only available within a specific project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions especially for the files of a particular project. simply said, this is the most limited size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project, which emoligates the shared use of special tools and patterns of all employees within the project."</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the tree views, the card readers with information and the toolbars. please enter, and for further information on these areas."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click on the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, like closing the current, other, or all flashriders, reloading, deleting or uploading the document, jump to a bookmarking or execution of CVS commands to the current document."</seg>
<seg id="2088">"right-click on the editor pane will lead to a further context menu with regard to the edited document content, such as basic editing steps (cut / paste), edit the tag under the mouse pointer, or open the file if the string under the mouse pointer is called a file."</seg>
<seg id="2089">"at the top end of the editor window are the toolbars of the editor. currently, & Quantaplus; & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is used as a standard for which a set of toolbars is shown. as part of the further expansion of & quantaplus, the toolbars are adapted to the new functions and related user needs."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, for example & lt; if you want to insert into your document, then click the icon that represents the tag. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (like anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"the Baumanviews (QIT;) allow you to navigate in the information about & quantaplus; to navigate, open and strip them. in the presentation with flashcards are available for files, project, sample templates, document structure, scripts, attributes and documentation of tree views."</seg>

<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories, depending on what context they are used. the category depends on the & quantaplus; work area. global templates are always available, local templates only usable for the appropriate user and templates in projects are only usable in the project."</seg>

<seg id="2198">Some with & quantaplus; provided templates have conditions for their use. please read the conditions mentioned at the beginning of each submission prior to use.</seg>
<seg id="2199">"binary templates are usually inserted in documents using links (e.g. images with img src = / src / url). some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. further information on the template tree is available."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"documents can be from any text document type. based on these templates, new documents can be created. usually, more specialized documents are created in corresponding subfolders. you make a simple framework for the purpose and organises the work in a corresponding way to be efficient. some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates. see in for more information on the template tree."</seg>
<seg id="2201">"this type of templates is useful if not a new document is to be inserted in the documents based on a template but the same text area. you can find everything from a comment to a final note up to a complete menu system on Javascript or Perl basics. some examples can be found in the template tree, under global templates. see for more information on the template tree."</seg>
<seg id="2202">"as the name says, these templates are used for whole websites as templates. they are a collection of various documents that can be organized in a folder structure, summarized in a compressed tar archive. currently there are no examples in & quantaplus."</seg>

<seg id="2205">"select text in your document and click File As template to save selection as a local / project template. alternatively, the selection can be dragged with drag and drop to the tree view templates."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"the creation of binary templates is simple: the file can only be copied to a template folder. it can be used for all file management functions, such as pulling and dropping or pasting over the file tree of Konqueror."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"you can click on a folder on the right and choose Site template, enter a name for the template and back up the template. by default it is saved in the project folder, but of course it can be saved as a local or global template."</seg>
<seg id="2208">"project templates allow a very goal-oriented approach. you can prefix headers and footers or dynamically with & PHP; design, insert files or link them with them. in addition, you can keep track of some things when using templates in projects."</seg>
<seg id="2209">The template structure in the subwindow templates is based on the files placed in $KDEDIR / share / apps / Quanta / apps / Quanta / templates / quanta / templates. each of these folders is one of four types of container as explained above.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"to specify the behavior of a folder, right click on the folder and select Properties in the context menu. the following dialog appears:"</seg>
<seg id="2211">"a selection box with the three previously described types; files, text or templates."</seg>
<seg id="2212">"this is enabled by default and fits all except the master folders in the template guide. if a root folder would be set up, it would basically deactivate templates in this path unless they were explicitly enabled. in case of a normal folder the blah would appear with something like text building block. if nothing appears, you probably will find yourself in a root folder."</seg>
<seg id="2213">This could be general headlines or footers for all templates for a specific project and allows you to equip a whole presentation with the matching headers / footers by copying content templates to a folder with special headers / footers.</seg>
<seg id="2214">"in addition, you have a context menu (pointing to the right mouse button) through a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and pasting templates from one place to another."</seg>
<seg id="2215">& Quantaplus; offers two modes: VPL; editor and VPL; & source text editor that can be reached via the View menu. the first mode replaces the source code editor by the VPL; editor and the second divides the editor window into two parts: the source editor and the VPL editor.</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the VPL editor works as follows: it loads a document like a normal & HTML; - or & XHTML; page, and a cursor appears. then you can edit and revert to the source code if needed."</seg>
<seg id="2217">"when working with the VPL; editor on a document containing & PHP, a small green icon shows the default of & PHP; it is not possible to edit it directly with the VPL editor. to edit & PHP; to edit it, the source code editor is still necessary. there are no plans to change this behavior."</seg>
<seg id="2218">"the second mode works just like the first, except that the changes are both visible in the source text editor and the VPL editor and the cursor in the source text editor and VPL editor. pressing F9, this mode is already active, pressing the active cursor from one window to another, maintaining the position in the document."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"the synchronization margin between the VPL editor and the source code editor is set to set up via settings Quanta.... After selecting VPL, you can select between synchronization after one click or automatically. in principle, the recommendation: a small span for fast computers and a large span for slow."</seg>
<seg id="2220">"assuming that you want to change the title of the website, it is possible to select document properties. this allows editing of invisible tags at work with the VPL editor. the document properties dialog is also called when a new document is created with the VPL editor."</seg>
<seg id="2221">Meta tags allow storing information about the document itself e.g. keywords for Internet search engines. meta-elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons at the bottom. a click into the list allows changing the contents e.g. keywords on the column name and keyword Keyword 2 on the content column.</seg>
<seg id="2222">CSS rules are the new way of designing the appearance of pages in the browser. you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list. a change over the list is just as possible with the meta elements. editing CSS rules is currently not supported.</seg>
<seg id="2223">It is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file-open button and selecting the appropriate file.</seg>
<seg id="2224">"the cursor is like in a word processor, by moving with the arrows, possible. under rare circumstances the cursor behaves strangely. the marking works as usual. text can be inserted by typing and dropping by means of a button or removing paste."</seg>
<seg id="2225">"inserting tags is done in the same way over the toolbar, as in the source text editor. it must be noted that inserting tags previously already existing identical tags cannot be removed, e.g. when an anchor tag is inserted with text, any other drop-down tag must be removed."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. so why & kdiff3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors had made many changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation in many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me only showed me the changed lines, but I could not see what exactly changed within these lines. and there were no references to the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"this was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3, could display differences within a line and changes to white characters. later, a lot of other useful functions were added."</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and insert it in one of the comparison windows."</seg>
<seg id="2286">"a function that made a lot of work, was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kdiff3; almost into a fully-fledged file browser."</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful if two people work independently from one piece of code and make changes. the original file (the base) helps to resolve conflicts and simultaneously display the result expected. in this editor you can even edit the result directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; to merge folders:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; displays exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often need to check code, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visible. if rows only differ in a certain number of white marks, one can see that at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same, and the other is different in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both differ."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by writing only the filename of the first file. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">Kdiff3 Folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 2 folder 3 -o destination folder</seg>
<seg id="2294">"the Open dialog allows you to manually typed filenames, selecting a file browser (file...) or selecting a last opened file from the drop-down list. the Open dialog remembers your selection and displays them next time. you do not need to specify a third file; if you leave the entry for C, the analysis of the differences with two files is performed."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"on the Folder folder... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the same or merge of folders will be initiated. if for A a file is selected, for B and C however a folder, then use & kdiff3; the filename from A in the two other folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merging is checked, the input field is active for the target and can be processed. however, it is not necessarily required to set an output file immediately. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Configuration button opens a dialog with settings. here you can set options before starting the merge / merge.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or selected text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you need to create two corresponding files, load them in & KB and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you cannot extract anything from & kdiff3; only drop text into a comparison window will be supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret the dragging and dropping text into another program as cutting and inserting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the Info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the file name and line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Every Info line has a different color. (if the path to a file is too long, let the mouse take a while over the line."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these presets can be changed using the Settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"if a difference is detected, one sees in the color which file differs. if both files differ, the default color is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful if you compare three files. this is good in the next section (merging)."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"when differences were found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white signs are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (for C / C + + for example, white signs are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in a few rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line dividing the constituent column from the text is interrupted at places where the source file has no lines. if the newline is activated, the line is dotted with broken lines."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (under the comparison windows) also has an info line with the inscription Edition:, the filename and [Geothe] if you edited the result. usually it contains text, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">"!! until all conflicts are resolved, saving is disabled!!! (use the Springe buttons for next resolved / unsolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"if only two comparison windows are used, each difference must be solved manually at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"by clicking with the left mouse button in the summing column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row will be marked in all windows and the first row of the group will be displayed. (this will also cause a jump in the position in the windows, where the group's first line is not visible.) This group will be highlighted with the color background color for current range and each on the left appears a black bar."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging or by manual editing; then in these lines the text & lt; No line in the queue; displayed. this is only a placeholder in the event you change your mind and maybe add another source. this text does not appear in the final saved file, nor in a marker that you might copy and paste somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="2313">"the text & lt; merge conflict; however, appears in the clipboard if you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function."</seg>
<seg id="2314">"note: when selecting sources ignoring numbers or ignoring ignoring C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated like white signs."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"when you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys left, right, high, down, side up, start, end, Ctrl-start and Ctrl-end, Siw as you are used by other programs."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"in the input window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. using the Insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">A click with the left mouse button in one of the summaries synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as explained in the merge section and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons to navigate with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Down / Ctrl-picture Abroad) or to the next / previous conflict."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"to copy the marking into the clipboard, you need to copy the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). there is also the option selection automatically copied. if this is enabled, whatever you mark, will automatically copy to the clipboard and copy the manual copy."</seg>
<seg id="2320">"line ends are stored according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors do not use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not retain the line end of the source files, so you should not use it with binaries."</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of last used files will be automatically saved when moving and restored at the next start. (menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 setup...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">"(on some systems the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)"</seg>
<seg id="2323">"if you enable this option, differences are displayed in italic font. if the selected script does not support this display, nothing happens at all."</seg>
<seg id="2324">"on systems with only 16 or 256 colors, some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed astert."</seg>
<seg id="2325">"when this option is enabled, the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the Tab key. otherwise, a tabulator character is inserted."</seg>
<seg id="2326">"when you press input or return, the previous line will automatically be used for the next line."</seg>
<seg id="2327">"when this option is enabled, each selection is automatically copied to the clipboard. manually copy the manual into the clipboard."</seg>
<seg id="2328">You can select which line type you prefer to store. the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used.</seg>
<seg id="2329">"the second step compares each line. in this step, white characters are not ignored. in this step, white signs are ignored."</seg>
<seg id="2330">"some editors (on some systems) save a cart-return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, others only save a newline '\'. if this option is enabled, the cart returns can be made visible, however like a white character."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"this option is disabled in the first part of the analysis. in the first part of the analysis numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"in default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"the option is activated in default. it is effective in complicated and large files, but slowly with very large files."</seg>
<seg id="2334">"in automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before jumping into the next unsolved conflict."</seg>
<seg id="2335">"this is useful if white characters in many files are less important. if you need this only from time to time, use better the Select A / B / C functions for any unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the Automatic Selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or ignoring C / C + + comments enabled."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"these options are dealt with in the chapter for scanning folders and performing a merge operation. see for details, see documentation on directory comparison and merge."</seg>
<seg id="2337">"if a file is saved and already exists an older version, the original version will be added to the suffix .orig. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .orig, it will be deleted without further backup."</seg>
<seg id="2338">"changing this option does not affect the current program. you need to stop and restart, so that the change is active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because the language is set globally via the control center.)"</seg>
<seg id="2339">"the following encoding settings can be set separately for each entry. if you activate this option, the upper setting is used for all entries."</seg>
<seg id="2340">The selection fields for encoding will show a brief indication of what the local code is. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)</seg>
<seg id="2341">"adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since encoding for each file is individually adjustable, even files with different encoding can be compared and merged."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"if you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding should be used for saving."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"if you define preprocessing commands, you might not be able to work with your codec. (for example, your files might be 16-bit Unicode, but the preprocessing command can only handle 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of the output of preprocessing commands."</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn this off to suppress highlighting changes in white signs in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments when the options are ignoring numbers or ignoring C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">"this selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color-coded overlay column. but sometimes you just want to see the differences between two of three files. after selection from A & lt; gt; B, A & lt; gt; C or B & lt; gt; C, besides the normal still another overlay column with the required information."</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen for long lines. simply use the less important windows. (this option is located in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">This can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">"sometimes, consider the differences and then decide unexpectedly to merge the files. a simple click starts the merge and uses the filename of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)"</seg>
<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it will first pass to this external command. in & kdiff3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your needs. you can use this function, for example, to remove disturbing parts or to correct the indentation."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it is first given to this external command. if a normal pre-processing command was specified (see above), the output of the command is used only at the time of the line. you can write your own preprocessor that meets your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to give the user more flexibility in setting up the diff results. however, an external program is required and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl are completely sufficient."</seg>

<seg id="2354">"while you experiment with sed, you might begin to understand it and maybe you may like these regular expressions even. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things."</seg>
<seg id="2355">Ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example for another pre-processing command for newlines. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Every character between' ['and'] 'is a hit and every hit is substituted by nothing.</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you might want to perform multiple translations at once. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the placements from each other. example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">"if sed\\ (and\\) is needed, perl only needs (and) without the previous'\\ '. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2358">The data after the normal preprocessor are retained for displaying and merging. the other operations only change the data that the line comparison algorithm sees.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases, if you are using a normal preprocessor, the line comparison processor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"the preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any feature that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally don't notice certain differences and in the worst case destroy important data."</seg>

<seg id="2627">"all four order types are processed in queues, with the exception of the output of screen readers. if an application sends the output of a screen reader, while & ktts; just one reads, this issue is stopped and finished."</seg>
<seg id="2628">"first, you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of screen editing. they are applied to normal warnings, messages and text orders as well as on & kde; messages."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Filters edit the text and pass it on to the next filter. currently there are three types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2630">Filters are designed as modules. in the future there can be further types of filters.</seg>
<seg id="2631">"string placements replace parts of a text by other text. the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions. & ktts; will be supplied with predefined string replacement filters, which allow the creation of chat emoticons such as: -) by text or for formatting messages from & konversation; or & kmail; in a better understandable way."</seg>

<seg id="2634">"each of these filters has adjustable rules, after which it is applied for a voice output. if the filter determines that its rules do not apply, it continues the text unchanged to the next filter."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"when a text order, a message, warning or a kde; notification to & ktts; sent, it is edited by all activated filters installed on the page. editing by the filters is done in the order in the list from top to bottom."</seg>

<seg id="2940">"& ksystemlog; is a & kde; viewer for system protocols. the program is for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the various protocol files. in addition, enables & ksystemlog; experienced users access quick access to information about problems that occur on their server."</seg>
<seg id="2941">"& ksystemlog; helps users understand what your computer is doing in the background. the task of & ksystemlog; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system. the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system, or where the system has the various protocol files stored."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"in addition, & ksystemlog; experienced users access quick access, for example, to information about problems appearing on their server. hence, try to provide some advanced features that can be filtered and evaluated by the protocol files of certain programs."</seg>
<seg id="2943">In the current version 0.4.1 has & ksystemlog; a number of useful functions. these include:</seg>
<seg id="2944">"support for many different types of log files, for the format of the Syslog server and for Samba"</seg>
<seg id="2945">Many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual.</seg>
<seg id="2946">"as you can see in the following screenshot, & ksystemlog; functions are available to easily filter and sort the individual protocol lines of a protocol file. the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual."</seg>
<seg id="2947">"after the start & ksystemlog; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will open to you, and it opens itself instead of a small news window, so you have & ksystemlog; most likely do not start with system administrator privileges."</seg>
<seg id="2948">"you can also use the filter bar to filter after a selected criterion, or after entered strings. the list of the log lines will now be displayed automatically, so that only log lines will be displayed next to the filter. in the default setting, a record line will only be displayed if in one of the columns the string of the filter search term is included."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"you can of course select another entry at this point. the string of the filter search term is then only matched to the entries in the column selected. for example, in the log file system protocol, select the process column, and then apply in the filter bar the name of a process, so shows you & ksystemlog; all protocol lines sent or created by this process."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"this option is enabled in the default setting, and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"if you want to show only certain processes (for example in the system protocol or in the Cron protocol), you can use the process identification (PID) in the process column. this can, for example, be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the start of the Samba server. in this case, use filter bar."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"in addition, you can enable the option to jump to new lines in the main window pop-up menu to view all new protocol-lines."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"& ksystemlog; allows displaying multiple log files in separate sub-windows. to use this function, use the entries in the menu to open and manage additional subwindows. once you have selected a subwindow, select a log to display in the menu."</seg>
<seg id="2954">& ksystemlog; has its own website on http: / / ksystemlog.forum-software.org. Dort you will find further information about the reference sources of & ksystemlog;.</seg>
<seg id="2955">& ksystemlog; also find in the following folder of the & kde; -Subversion archive: ksystemlog; in & kde; archive</seg>
<seg id="2956">"welcome to & kde; System V Init Editor, more known (and so named) as & ksysv; This section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv;"</seg>
<seg id="2957">"the V Init System is rapidly becoming the standard for program start monitoring when running the system in the & Linux world. and that's why, because it is easier to use, more powerful, and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD-init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not deal with historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to switch a machine to System V Init without reinstalling and formatting. that's why you need to make sure that the old Init was removed from there, if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init also differs from the BSD Init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is called rc.sysit, and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"init.d contains a whole lot of scripts. basically you need a script for any system service you want to boot when running the system or when switching to another runlevel. system services do not include such things as setserial, which will only start once. such calls go to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"you can also create a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to run a rc.serial in / etc / rc.d, if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel searches in different places after the program init and starts the first one to find.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The standard runlevel is entered in / etc / inittab. you should see a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point, you can take a look at the second column and probably find that the default runlevel 3 is. if you want to change it, then you can manually edit / etc / inittab by hand and change the 3."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does all the correct scripts start? if you enter ls -l in rc3.d, then you'll probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that there are no real files in this folder. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that there is an argument like start and stop. you can actually start these scripts from hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if the one contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will start with the argument start."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level running only httpd, & sendmail;, network & etc; in addition, I could also have a user running level, the & eg; & kdm;, network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you learn how to use & ksysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was designed as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">Using & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not tell trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six runlevel to start it on this level (or stop).</seg>
<seg id="2973">You can also move scripts between Runleveln or change the position within a level by moving it elsewhere. this will not happen if you extract an entry from the range of available system services.</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved when you move them into a new area. to just copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly select Copy from the Edit menu or select from the context menu and insert into the destination area -- even if the same entry has already existed in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the registration number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you need to edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: currently there is no way to restore entries thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the Tab key to activate the different working areas (Available system services, runlevel 1 start, runlevel 1 stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection top or below the previous ones."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and insert it in the desired runlevel with insert (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the key to open the Properties dialog. use the Tab key to switch between different fields. close the dialog by pressing the input key to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are saved in $KDEHOME / share / ksysvrc. default settings are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if it is available. otherwise they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are saved in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
<seg id="2982">"I experimented with the standard runleveln, and now the machine is constantly starting new. what can I do?"</seg>
<seg id="2983">Enter the LILO -Prompt linux single and press the input key to start in single user mode. then edit the / etc / inittab file and change the standard runlevel to a reasonable value (3 should normally be fine).</seg>
<seg id="2984">"I have provided some system services with & ksysv; for running on Runlevel X, but they are not executed."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"if you use SuSE; or Delix (DLD), you must edit additional files in / etc that are only available in these distributions. please read the details in the manual of the distribution."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"the way system services are started in these distributions, simplifies the configuration for the proprietary implementation programs of these distributions, but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard. the authors of & ksysv; plan an extension of the program for this approach."</seg>
<seg id="2987">"if you are using another distribution, please check if all configuration files are available which are needed by the system service (and also if they are in the correct directory). some services (such as & eg; Apache or httpd) simply end without message if their configuration files are not present or incorrectly set up."</seg>
<seg id="2988">"the meaning of the & Linux; runlevel varies from distribution to distribution, can even be different from version to version. if you are using another distribution, please send me information about the runlevel so that this manual can be added."</seg>
<seg id="2989">This documentation refers to & kuser; 1.0. with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system.</seg>

<seg id="2993">"some card cards are only displayed if you have advanced system settings. only when you activate space restrictions (Quota) for users, a card card will be created where you can set individual settings. additional card cards appear if Shadow passwords or for example / etc / master.passwd are installed like in BSD-Unixes."</seg>
