&quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation , I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound impact on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old , I saw the magnificent D@@ enz@@ el Washington , how he played Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can letter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who covered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil magn@@ ate with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was , as if that is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I lived in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the US had only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said , &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it &apos;s easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I had even written a very black@@ ish love letter about its size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
in his opinion he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautifully .
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it , and publicly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted for him in dro@@ ves . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the Party has ever reached . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ oted person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , director of the journ@@ alism programme , which takes people from all over the world , a deep believing human being , with whom I could talk about Islam and its past . &quot;
&quot; in his view , Tru@@ mps did not agree with the view of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met in our joint love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns &quot; at the game .
&quot; she is also in stark contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fights the environment for her life , and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
&quot; she still fits to Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es &apos;s commitment , which always helped me to get used to the complexity of American life with much patience and grace . &quot;
&quot; then there were Andrew treats , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp b@@ ah@@ ed his way to the nominated Republi@@ can presidential candidate , they gave me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
&quot; it turned out , however , that they were the exception of the rule . &quot;
&quot; on November 8 , 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , presi@@ ded over a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t towards non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp , because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to call the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and respect@@ ful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that those voters , most of whom are white , voted for Tru@@ mp , because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who comments on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contemp@@ t on those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( note D. Ü ) : as much as &quot; rebellion of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities , &quot; white in all@@ usion to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones described , exactly what America did so great . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country elected as its president twice the son of a Ken@@ yan , whose history , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world . &quot;
&quot; however , with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp , there is a huge part of the white America &apos;s promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 , the white man is back at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a demonstration for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , would my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd answered with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; do Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; do Lat@@ inos have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
do A@@ fr@@ o Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; they cried and their voices became lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and vo@@ iced &quot; NO ! &quot;
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , isn &apos;t that your America . &quot; &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the country , for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; that is now Tru@@ mp Land , said the news . &quot;
&quot; and all the people that look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and that breaks my heart .

out of misery to the stars : these Latin American children cannot spoil their love for music by rub@@ b@@ ish
&quot; the &quot; Recycl@@ ed Instruments Orchestra &quot; by C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay , during a concert in Washington DC . &quot;

what did the Mexican music school of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community have in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca together with the children of the Paragu@@ a@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura ?
&quot; the music , which is played at both places , has not only changed the life of the children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the tr@@ ash
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill site , only 16 km south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial town , very popular among tourists , but worlds away from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for several years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ ú@@ sica ( music band ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra composed of children and adults , which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for their drug abuse and gangs . &quot;
&quot; but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot , who started a musical project and offered a rare hope of hope for the youth . &quot;
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ IV : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; they always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the hu@@ stle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , all@@ horn , tim@@ pan@@ i , bon@@ gos and the con@@ ga . &quot;
music from Wa@@ ste
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero are the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is located on the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ ón in Paragu@@ ays &apos;s capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ manufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double b@@ asses , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and percussion , all produced from waste . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music as well as music of the Beat@@ les , Frank Sin@@ atra , etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article in the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o Cha@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and educ@@ ator of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the beginning : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no place for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in tr@@ ash . children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children . &quot;
this changed when F@@ avi@@ o was shown something he never saw before : a violin made from waste .
&quot; today , there is a whole orchestra , which plays instruments of re@@ manufactured material and which is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentary called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) shows the musical performance :
&quot; every year , the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish . &quot;
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est - like people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can effectively combat illegal fishing
photo © F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that comb@@ ats wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that specifically reports about international , practical solutions for environmental problems . &quot;
the re@@ publication occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia , before it looked for Africa &apos;s other coast . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal law of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the Com@@ es , Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobili@@ zed against the ship . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who just refused everything , &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior cler@@ k of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at his time . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
&quot; ultimately , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia , due to pl@@ under@@ ing the country &apos;s fish stocks . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which crosses criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 was founded by N@@ RO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( Il@@ legal Fish@@ eries ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network are the six countries which had then expelled the prime minister from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; with this we have eight countries , who are like @-@ minded and work together . they exchange information and stand on each other when it comes to illegal fishing &quot; , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable Tru@@ sts Project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . F@@ ISH @-@ i provides technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is un@@ regulated by definition : what is captured is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing in regions . &quot;
&quot; by the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , through which certain habitats and species are to be protected , the illegal fishing can harm ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; but while campaigns against illegal fishing had once been ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and also by the sn@@ ail stamp , which circul@@ ated information between individual countries , the actions are now done in real time , with trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communication platform . &quot;
&quot; there the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses , for example , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i also pursu@@ es the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite data .
&quot; this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas . also , such suspi@@ cious cycle routes can be discovered - such as those indicating that a ship will load its caught fish on the move to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were travelling and possibly also whether they have a criminal code . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is about significant financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the already mentioned platform was created to regain estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover , which will lose the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network each year due to the illegal f@@ ishers who inv@@ ade East African waters . &quot;
East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world .
&quot; their practices include campaigns such as sailing under false flag , bog@@ us licence papers , fantasy names , fishes of protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately exploit the lack of international co @-@ operation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; earlier a ship could fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You dar@@ ed not start my port . &apos; &quot;
&quot; but another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and exactly this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i now . &quot;
&quot; until now , the closed front works . &quot;
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships . &quot;
it has uncovered criminal networks that had spread bog@@ us licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties and it has followed and found escap@@ ing ships .
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to combat crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and receive information on illegal fishing over long distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious vessels more precisely .

&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; the illegal f@@ ishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position , &quot; &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , chief analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at tracking , an NGO that also deals with fish@@ eries data and provides F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems , for example , so they can no longer be ordered by satellites . &quot;
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that combines different levels of information . F@@ ISH @-@ i should help to find criminal @-@ acting ships with greater precision .
a model program
but F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team can actually influence the un@@ question@@ ably global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the N@@ RO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana marine conservation organization : a platform that offers satellite data and by means of which the position of each trac@@ eable ship can be displayed worldwide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what , it simply makes sense , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot; &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships . &quot;
there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect criminals but also deter them .
ships that had been f@@ ished without a license and had little consequences for them now know that they are being watched .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries involved at F@@ ISH show a 33 % increase in fishing turnover , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use was prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become a study object . &quot; &quot; in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there have been six countries joined together in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they also combat illegal fishing , according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; security is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s most recent country was able to announce its first major triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was traveling under false flag . and not only was the ship travelling without a license and used tow@@ ing nets that are now banned . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 , they set a strong sign that they would go against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i , this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative way of working to protect the oceans actually works across the world . Emma Br@@ yce is a freelance journalist and lives in London . there she writes about the environment , technology and nutrition . &quot;
&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela is further escal@@ ating : demonstrations in several cities with the goal to &quot; &quot; rec@@ ap@@ ture the country &quot; &quot; &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro &apos;s im@@ pe@@ achment .

&quot; after the government had rejected the motion of the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the country &apos;s political and economic crisis ended in empt@@ iness , assembling itself on the streets . &quot;
under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( for example : the reg@@ ression of Venezuela ) both pictures of these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found .
&quot; the debate is also held in other parts of the country - among others in the low@@ land area of Bar@@ inas , in the An@@ des regions Mé@@ ri@@ da and T@@ á@@ chir@@ a , in the central north of the country Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the daily life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition , in the resolution of the current President Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ uro , saw the chance for a fundamental change ; in the end , however , the reluct@@ ance of a new election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ í@@ az , contribut@@ or at Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ ari@@ zes the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; in the context of the social , political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rate are among the highest in the world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % at the end of the year ) and in which a serious and far @-@ reaching lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum in favour of many as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Demo@@ cr@@ á@@ tica or short MU@@ D ( roughly : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups have joined forces , urged the demonstr@@ ators to continue on 27 October to support the National Assembly . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : tomorrow &apos;s National Assembly , Friday national civil strike and on November 3rd all to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores palace . &quot;

&quot; the first demonstration in the framework of the Action Programme &quot; &quot; The Recon@@ quest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26 . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming participation of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government . &quot;
one of the most commonly divided pictures shows a prot@@ esters calling through the shiel@@ ds : &quot; will you kill me because I am hungry ? &quot;

&quot; on Twitter , images are pil@@ ed up , telling of disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
especially large waves struck the news of police repression in the central @-@ north town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
the demonstr@@ ators moved back to the local cathedral to protect themselves from the police and armed advoc@@ ates of the government .
&quot; hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State T@@ á@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ á@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise one could see something that many national gar@@ den@@ ers did not have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic makes the round , which forms the amount of suppression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has supp@@ ressed the country .
many representatives of the government questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office - this has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of innumerable people on the road .
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s :
Nicol@@ ás and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fake .
here is your minist@@ erial exercise !
on the road !
&quot; others see these protests as a further step in the struggle against a government , which , from its point of view , has taken little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and has preferred to mu@@ te critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also the fear !
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
&quot; some Venezu@@ el@@ ans reported the media , they were too hungry to take part in a strike rather than work or go shopping . &quot;

&quot; this is an adapted version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ ó@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ ía a D@@ ía , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news site . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to watch the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process in the province of Córdoba . &quot;
&quot; in the trial which ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship were investigated . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Per@@ la prison , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept his family secret .
&quot; in the situation at that time , I believed that it was fine . &quot;
I felt like a secret agent .
as a child with 15 years you don &apos;t notice that you are manipul@@ ated by his father .
&quot; at that time , I was not able to realize that my father was a th@@ ief , tor@@ turer and rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was his father , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father from 1976 to 1978 was Deputy Commander of the Intelligence Department at La Per@@ la prison . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor who is accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ an@@ os son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a federal court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child chose for himself a path of redemption .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father began to take me to the military base , I often went with us to the sports hall . there I had friends with a boy who made martial arts . &quot;
all called it &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black and white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have friends with one of the ERP friends . &quot;
pass only that they don &apos;t take you one day and then I must save you .
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ ér@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the revolutionary workers &quot; party in Argentina . &quot;
that is why he for@@ ba@@ de me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work at the military base .
he told me that I would be jeal@@ ous .
&quot; I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought , that would be fine . &quot;
&quot; at the military base , I had to destroy papers which had belonged to the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , just everything . &quot;

&apos;@@ There the prisoners are tortured
my father took me four times to La Per@@ la - all in 1976 .
during the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks , in the cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just anything else . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a little bag wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big l@@ ump of silver . &quot;
&quot; on that day I went to the other end of the barracks , where the stolen objects were put off and kept me with a guard post . &quot;
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I se@@ wed in , and saw a couch that men were tortured . &quot;
it looked like a bed and a metal cushion .
later I found out that they mounted it at the end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was lying there .
&quot; they rarely hold a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs on the bed , poured it with water and drove him a load of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was terrible ... like a dirty wind .
&quot; years later when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I recognized the smell immediately and I became clear that the smell of a body is in need .
I could never forget this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that a person can do so much harm to another person ?
I knew these people were killed
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the cap@@ tives were tied with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and were bound to bind ey@@ eb@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ ó@@ pez , a civilian who was also indic@@ ted in the trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a series of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay down with the face - all were tied at hands and feet .
&quot; near the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ched still on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you mean , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew that these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know that because my dad told me about it .
&quot; next to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , there were some rooms that were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero hit a man there and killed a man .
&quot; according to the survivors of the civilian population , Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also indic@@ ted at La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera , was called Ra@@ ú@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina to death ) . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the memorial La Per@@ la , leads through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this path and then were tortured for the first time . &quot;
here their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ izing .
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra until the order from above came that they should be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of the people and the disappearance of their bodies in most cases .
the &apos; War Po@@ wers &apos;
my father brought home all sorts of stolen things .
at that time I had no idea what the &quot; spo@@ ils of war &quot; - as they called it - was .
&quot; but when I was at the military later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et or perhaps military markings , which one takes away from an enemy that has been fought . &quot;

&quot; but if you go into a house and the refrigerator , turn@@ tables , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not a war , but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is theft .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the head of security forces , could take part in this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I just don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my father could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I replied , &quot; &quot; And you , who st@@ ole cars on the street ? &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded in anger , struck me and cried : &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , then I will find you and kill yourself . &quot;
to do this we need no one else !
this is how my father was .
I don &apos;t have a single good memory of him .
&quot; when I said in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a roll collar pul@@ lover of wool . both had my father from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothing back home . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied that no problem , they can lay me on what they wanted . &quot;
I was there anyway to testify .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now that I am older , I feel regret . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you recognize the value of a life . &quot;
one continues to develop and realize that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you executed people during the dictatorship . but why did the corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why are children going to kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - only that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have simply put them into prison .
I guess it was simply decided to kill these people . but why did their corp@@ ses disappear ?
did these people not even families to whom they could pass their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of the corp@@ se is the last abom@@ in@@ able act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was introduced again , they took machines to remove the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were gr@@ ind@@ ed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you will never find anything , &quot; said my father . &quot;
but something always remains .
I have seen how you killed people !
just to clarify : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
&quot; the thought to display my father arose during a conversation , when he was under house arrest . &quot;
I made him repro@@ aches of all the atro@@ cities I had to experience in his account .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anyone . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rej@@ ecting and asked myself what the whole exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; Western and Christian feelings , &quot; which they supposedly defended , were actually good . &quot;
then I cried :
how can you tell me something like that ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you have committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he only replied , &quot; &quot; Well , I &apos;ll show you . &quot;
that &apos;s what I did .
in 2010 I provided the first advertisement .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
nobody can repro@@ ach me that I &apos;m pre@@ occupied . I finally said against my own father .

the judgments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence in Spanish . &quot;
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historical La Per@@ la Ri@@ bera process ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 , against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity . in 28 cases , the Court was sentenced to life imprisonment and in nine cases prison sentences ranging between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of originally 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Perm judgement : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; all the accused were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian employees . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the Swiss Chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by in@@ human heads .
the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ inian organization H.@@ I.@@ J. O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people who were murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process lasted more than three years , but the research for it lasted 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an government sur@@ rendered the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that a memorial site could be erected there , which is now being led by human rights organisations . &quot;

&quot; a translation mistake makes older people in K@@ YO@@ TO &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful drivers &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the shield with the translation error in a center in Kyoto , where you can extend its driver &apos;s license . &quot;
the photo was spread in the social media .
processing of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese town of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre where they can pro@@ long their driver &apos;s license , witnessed a particularly un@@ fortunate translation in the last month . &quot;
&quot; the Japanese word was written on a shield , which means &quot; older mot@@ orists , &quot; fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with evil h@@ ind @-@ thoughts &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic displays in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; adaptation of the original photo by Joshua Lev@@ ine , which was widely shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the error was noticed by translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also aware of the local newspapers . &quot;
&quot; the Kyoto paper , which is published in Kyoto , wrote : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it result in such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that nobody has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to elderly people and in an international city like Kyoto is simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the incorrect English translation was first removed . the term &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , although gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct name &quot; elder drivers &quot; ( german : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the mistake had already been contained in the text they had received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its correctness before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that older people felt insul@@ ted by the inadequate correction ( translation ) on our part , &quot; said the police . &quot;
the Japanese online news service J @-@ C@@ ast News set out a little more detailed with the phenomenon of the &quot; terrible &quot; older drivers in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older drivers . according to the police , the proportion of older mot@@ orists who are involved in accidents across the country are quite a concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of altogether 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors . this corresponds to a percentage of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors caused 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
&quot; as a result , their share rose to 17.@@ 7 % . &quot;
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of accidents caused by sen@@ iors rose in the same period . &quot;
&quot; in the version of the article published on Yahoo , the non @-@ called re@@ porter brought comments to the light that show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ ap against older drivers : &quot;
&quot; among other things , the article on Yahoo for translation errors received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; Is this ( &quot; &quot; fear@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not the reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; How defective is the translation really not , isn &apos;t it ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t think that &apos;s a real translation error . &quot;
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre bugs in English .

the reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; to translate , you need two important skills : passive language skills in order to understand the starting text and to transfer active language skills in order to transfer it to the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . generally , the conviction that translators should be in the target language - should not be in the original language - native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue to translate the translations into English . this may be due to lack of understanding of transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have foreign employees , can nevertheless produce translations within the company . then the Japanese employee , whose English knowledge is considered the best , is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the r@@ ins@@ ing and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences , created by mechanical translations , show that this technique can &apos;t replace any human translator for a long time . this applies especially to some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the mysterious im@@ prints that often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or even understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry . but by large companies or by the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards you can expect more careful translations .
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : taking protests and cens@@ orship in the internet and television
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ ing@@ con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , April 7 , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users announced that they had no access to the online channel Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the internet presentations of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV are no longer accessible . &quot;
other online broad@@ cast@@ ers also recorded footage of protests in Car@@ ac@@ as organised by opposition groups who oppose the government of Nicol@@ ás Mad@@ u@@ ros .
&quot; the protests began in early April , after the Supreme Court dis@@ b@@ anded the Parliament and deleg@@ ated the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court himself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ í@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was well known and recommended users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to get access to the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : enables your VPN .
it seems that Internet pages are closed again to Venezu@@ el@@ an providers .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media has been hes@@ it@@ ant in reporting on protests since 2014 . at that time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continue to report on the demonstrations because the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
I registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net again without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
it is amazing that it is still cheaper than to buy two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ it@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had revealed that the local internet providers sometimes use DNS . this is a technique by which the DNS servers answer requests of certain domains in@@ correctly . &quot;
&quot; if a Internet page is blocked by the DNS , the server responds er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously or refuses the request when calling such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS block : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third locked channel , was set up on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who carried the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as live , was detained . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
eight hours later he was released and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again .
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , it has also been reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections : this makes the Venezu@@ el@@ ans access to multimedia coverage of the current events in the country more and more difficult . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to receive education &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a child a cri@@ m@@ son . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina fights for the rights of children and ga@@ thers testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ k@@ tas that were just as victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;

the following article is the abri@@ dged version of a report written by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en &quot; ( &quot; Flying cows , falling schools &quot; ) edited and re@@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family that lived there .
&quot; shortly before gradu@@ ating from university , she returned to the house again and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us . &quot;
&quot; the one that has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old she began to work as cri@@ m@@ ta for the family . in Paraguay , the more than 4@@ 6.000 boys and girls who are forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a large family with little money handed over her under@@ age son or her under@@ age daughter to another weal@@ thier family . in exchange , the child gets food , training and a roof over the head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children must pay for it countless days of house@@ work which will never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all that within the framework of a contract that cannot be lifted . &quot;
&quot; this practice , called Cri@@ k@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after completing her studies , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization fighting for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she spoke with Cri@@ mean - especially young girls were affected by the practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ ac@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ching and den@@ ounced . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated to the Cri@@ mean is generally silent . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ k@@ az@@ go is based on a double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family that takes their daughter into believing that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out of themselves &quot; , &quot; is handed over to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family who assimil@@ ates the girl with her and justi@@ fies its exploitation with the belief that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of the Cri@@ k@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will be experienced only many years later . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the previously unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the hidden in par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ ín came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ ú , her body showed traces of violent blows . shortly thereafter she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
she was in the household of the former military father Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt .
&quot; Mar@@ ín was living with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ ía , a small town with only 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ ón . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra proposed a stick to Mar@@ ín until she suffered deadly injuries . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
a few days later the media reported about the incident .
they stressed that the murdered child was a cri@@ m@@ son .
organizations like UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deep in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society rooted practice of the Cri@@ ad@@ ac@@ go for the death of the girl .
they referred the Cri@@ k@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and called for &quot; no more Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the name of the girl and photos were widely distributed in the social media .
&quot; in Paraguay more cows are registered as children , &quot; &quot; compla@@ ined Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; without papers , it is much easier to violate the rights of children . &quot;
&quot; without official documents , it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live . &quot;
the neighbours of the couple and almost 60 civil society organizations called for a spe@@ edy investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ ás Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo to be sentenced to 30 years in prison , for the murder of the girl who was her Cri@@ mean . &quot;
&quot; if the case comes to court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ ín could be directional - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ k@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a cri@@ ad@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ mean tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to register bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his work . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to work all the time and began selling sweets on the street , or on the market to earn money . &quot;
but they all went to school .
only Tina was sent to the capital As@@ unci@@ ón as Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked in the house of her employers between four and six hours each day .
she had to divide the time in such a way that she was still time to learn .
she stood up at five o &apos;clock every morning and prepared breakfast for her employers .
&quot; for example , Fri@@ days cleaned the fridge , pla@@ stered the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she was finished with learning , the more spare time she had . &quot;
but even this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ nar@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but also didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to fetch more books from the master &apos;s library as food from the fridge , &quot; she re@@ members . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ers of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which was in power during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; some evenings forced the land@@ owner Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a to stand alongside him and read editorial papers such as &quot; &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he tried to convince them to not give faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime . &quot;
&quot; he thought she was intelligent , but did not stop her . &quot; the landlord had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they felt that I would have &quot; &quot; bad habits &quot; &quot; there again . &quot; &quot; that &apos;s what they thought that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a , who belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ í , would again speak their native language Guar@@ an@@ í . &quot;
&quot; her master feared that she would lose the education that she had allowed her to lose , she explains . &quot;
&quot; she was , however , fully aware that she had paid for everything she got from them , with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; even in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken are bul@@ lying and har@@ ass@@ ment exposed to Cri@@ mean when they go to school . &quot;
&quot; because the other children have parents , they immediately recognise that someone who has no parents is a cri@@ m@@ son . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t invite anybody to come home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .
&quot; in my youth , in the time when friend@@ ships develop , I felt particularly clear that I was not part of a group . &quot;

&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group where you can share jobs for clean@@ ers and girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the group &apos;s administration is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a city coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ ón district . &quot;
Hello ! I &apos;m looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
&quot; start from Monday , if possible . &quot;
the ad received five &quot; likes &quot; and many comments .
a woman from the town Ñ@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an el@@ eventh girl and gave her telephone number .
&quot; another woman , also from Ñ@@ em@@ by , offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third commentary , &quot; a girl from the interior who wants to work . &quot; &quot;
then the summary of the display switched on once again :
&quot; dear friends , I have found one . I look at it working with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .

bill design@@ ates Egyptian users of social media to register with the government

sixty Egyptian MPs recently voted on a bill to &quot; regulate the regulation on use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it is accepted by Parliament , users and users of social media in Egypt must register at a governmental authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up , which is mand@@ ated to give citizens a permit to use social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months with the adoption of the law , users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and ID number to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if it fails to do so , it could bring a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or fin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the bill , which consists of six paragra@@ phs and circul@@ ates in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice , video messages and text . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how the law is enforced when it is adopted , since the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration on users who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Member of Parliament and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the fire@@ wall blocked by Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level all around Facebook . due to them , it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; Senior Research Scienti@@ st &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , on German &quot; Egyptian initiative for personal rights &quot; ) , commented Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to be done with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they have forci@@ bly control physical public and private spaces , it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , it means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a crazy system to monitor people &apos;s activities and to bring them to a trial . &quot;
this is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed at the legislative of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its acceptance and enforcement be successful or not , the draft is in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in whose sense the control will be maxim@@ ized and ensured that no diver@@ ging nar@@ ration is present on the screen , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life @-@ long prison sentence was intended for those who were found guilty of threatening the &quot; public order &quot; and &quot; to protest . &quot; &quot;
how a Kurdish nature prot@@ ector protects the Persian Leopard in Iraq &apos;s war

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal rights activists H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and their team of scientists from the non @-@ governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the spirits of the Persian le@@ op@@ ards . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , who fight through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether , there are between 800 and 1000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to po@@ aching , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and as they find less and less loo@@ t . &quot;
why is this particular type of le@@ op@@ ards so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big predat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard in fact is small and goes against zero . as the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately likes to show a different side of her country , which is not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies on wildlife and educational programs in Nature Iraq for six years .
since 2013 she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group and is committed to providing protection zones for wild animals in the Kurdist@@ an Region .

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the daily newspaper K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a massive earthquake , ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom accident in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma caused the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture was a state pre@@ f@@ ecture in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighboring states Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate because the ts@@ un@@ ami had abandoned entire coastal towns from the map .
&quot; the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma was still experiencing a nuclear accident , already alone , 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone . &quot;
&quot; the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows from the local point of view , which progress has been reached six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves .
&quot; apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o @-@ Zeitung reports that up to December 2015 , a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses ( which have been completed ) were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to see the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 per cent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma forms the final light with 70 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , still , six years after the catastrophe , the evacu@@ ation of temporary shel@@ ters ( that is to be evacu@@ ated to Kas@@ ets@@ u ju@@ ut@@ ak@@ u ) remains to be reloc@@ ated to final replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , nearly 80@@ ,000 people were forced to live in homes . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , 36@@ ,000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such dwell@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ations from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , while Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper could determine , 10@@ 74 of 1,@@ 100 schools , which were affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors by December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later it states that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is far more difficult .
&quot; while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 percent of fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operations in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of agr@@ arian land , moved extensively . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land , with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 percent destroyed farm@@ land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are located in the nuclear barrier zone . &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but also here Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma remains far off . &quot;
&quot; the tourist numbers in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can show only 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal dwell@@ ers , it is more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the survivors . &quot;
&quot; in its introduction to the article , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey in order to learn more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
&quot; the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents , measures have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is . &quot;
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention has been done . &quot;
how it is about those who had to evacu@@ ated from the Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in its edition to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacu@@ ation from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to experience not only the tremendous earthquake and the devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness to the worst , cat@@ astrop@@ hic , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; from 160 000 evacu@@ ations from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 , a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , had been res@@ ett@@ led into permanent replacement houses . &quot;
&quot; according to the 2017 stand , 40,000 residents of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma are living outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas , most of the evacu@@ ated ones are older than 50 years old . it is well known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma need to compete with massive construction projects . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when you encounter people from other countries speaking a different language , the differences seem to be bigger than the common ones . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often sees that a more connects than it appears at first glance . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices pod@@ cast , we look closely at these global links . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we deal with issues that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone about language and country borders .

Brazilian activ@@ ist in the artificial coma after being beaten up by the police in nationwide demonstrations

rei@@ ght : Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva on a widely used photo .
&quot; a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered this week to the intensive care unit : last Friday , a police officer had hit him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia . in the country , millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social science at the University of Go@@ i@@ ás , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated him this Saturday and now transferred him to an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus that quickly spread in Brazil within a few days .
on the pictures is also the face of the police officer to recognize who attacked a strike . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o .
&quot; after the incident , the Military Police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ ás announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the conclusion of the incident . &quot;
the pictures show the police officer how he hits the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a police officer would be beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and landing on the intensive care unit , his face would be seen on television for six months and the entire oppression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ neur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media channel of media activists from Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z on the net in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from another perspective , is also immersed in social networks . &quot;
in the clip shown below you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second .
&quot; for the family of Mat@@ eus , who lives in another state , Internet users have donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 Euro ) in order to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to allow his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ â@@ nia while he is in the hospital . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Ort@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ ás : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish has been killed by his father because he supported the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . here , the military police of a W@@ hat@@ s@@ App group joined forces , only to crimin@@ alize teachers , and now we have the very sad case of Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , who was attacked by a police officer who attacked him with a head@@ stock . &quot;
police re@@ ass@@ aults
&quot; Go@@ i@@ ás was not the only state in Brazil , where it came to brutal police missions on demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; police officers were in the centre of Rio de Janeiro where demonstr@@ ators had set up a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the deputy Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; this includes a report in Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have obsc@@ ured street protests by focusing on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a window pane . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de S. Paulo were specifically reporting a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their titles with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set in fire . &quot;
there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window pane than about the protests of thousands of people serving the defense of a special cause .
this must also be recognised if one is strictly against any kind of damage .
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; receives an absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police are obsc@@ ured by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Un@@ indu@@ str@@ ations For@@ gotten Villa@@ ges in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Á@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane manufacturers in all Cuba joined the doors ( Photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill , regardless of the fact that there are no appreci@@ able sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ zed .
&quot; after succ@@ um@@ bing , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its plants until only the ru@@ mo@@ urs of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ igned and comm@@ uting daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a veter@@ an veter@@ an who rises every day at 4 : 00 a.m. , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not ro@@ b his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which after a long in@@ active time are in operation because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene remember exactly to have heard that in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane factory would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ s the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , the low market prices , in@@ efficiency , bad management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the quantity produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the message would have been a motive for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no more news . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the community already saw better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsol@@ ete , and hardly competitive they became unbe@@ ar@@ able for the country . &quot;
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production target was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories to produce sugar for maximum 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives leading to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; nevertheless , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; from 2017 to 20@@ 25 , the price of un@@ refined sugar must remain between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound , according to the 2016 report &quot; Agricultural perspectives &quot; by the OECD and FAO , the United Nations Agricultural and Nutrition Organization . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , the export of raw sugar would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; today &apos;s day will surely go into history , &quot; these were the first words of the Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on 21 October 2002 in the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring in the sugar industry began .
&quot; in the following years , the shut@@ down of a total of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further training . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane Factory Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ ée Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto Pé@@ rez has worked in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , speaks about the closure of the factory , the word he repeated most is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would be shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be maintained , they constituted a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of honour , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; these were officially recorded documents , which were only distinguished for the parts which would be removed , addressed to the add@@ res@@ see and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the Minister could appro@@ ve any withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was taken over and the letters were getting more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the dis@@ car@@ ded factory for two years , and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years , awaits the retirement in another plant , Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was against his will at the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with every part he removed , he disman@@ tled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the most developed industrial area of Cuba and the most important workplace producer was extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives for the work sites and services generated in the communities in which they were located . &quot;
&quot; we will never know if during the mam@@ mot@@ h speech of October 21 , 2002 , the former president looked into the eyes of the people present when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of sugar cane factories
since 2004 sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years the community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ é Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane factory closed , or better said than they began to sort it out , they also stopped to asp@@ hal@@ ve the road , this dis@@ advant@@ es other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with an advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they became part of spare parts .
&quot; without any prospects for the future , many young people once left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area , a food factory was created , whose production does not even serve for the supply of the congregation . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 , N@@ ene returned to the factory of Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
forty @-@ nine harv@@ ests give the old soldier a pension of two thousand Pes@@ o a month to spend the years retired in Ma@@ ñ@@ al@@ ich .
&quot; N@@ ene , a man of black skin colour , small , with few teeth and clear voice , is not a bear@@ able person , yet he does not forgive the lies you told him . &quot;
they have tor@@ mented him for ten years .
&quot; N@@ ene is 65 years old in retirement , not because it lacks power , but because it is bit@@ tern@@ ess . &quot;

&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour , workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by the educ@@ ator David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then collabor@@ ated with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop Group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop ends with the fact that the young participants in talks are topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , confrontation , love , self acceptance , &quot; or whatever comes to mind . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribal area of the Kit@@ sum@@ kal@@ um First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called Highway of tears , a road section in West@@ kan@@ ada , where almost two dozen of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
the cases were mostly not elu@@ ci@@ dated .
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation is .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always know the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First nation recorded , the chor@@ us is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; the youths involved here received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the North @-@ star hip @-@ hop group , who gave them a stop@@ per in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; on the fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ ks@@ side of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script , as well a translation into English which is translated into German : &quot;
sometimes I feel like nobody is ever interested in me
but I try to continue my days on earth
this is the day when you will take our cry
because as youth we lost our way in life
but I believe that we will raise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
this is how they can grow and also move on as well as our youth .
so they can do what they intended for the Creator
&quot; in the comments section , the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the stop@@ per in sy@@ ll@@ ables ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; plastic dishes ( some of which are located in Japan ) , outside of a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

in Japan you can see plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant .
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , close to the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; plastic models of the courts &quot; &quot; ) of any dish served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they are entering or continuing the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a lot of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they don &apos;t even notice them anymore . however , a new trend is turning them into show@@ y mobile phone accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome published the blo@@ gger it@@ ini@@ i series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new with plastic dishes decorated cell phone tapes as shown in the K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial foods were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collection objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are some Sho@@ ku@@ hin fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly more complex .
&quot; in this case , an imperial @-@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was transformed into a mobile support . &quot;
&quot; for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) , we found a good use as a mobile support . &quot;
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station .
and here is an apple that holds your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for the mobile phone , this is already a great design . &quot;
and this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic .
&quot; some mobile des@@ kt@@ ops and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a or salmon @-@ che@@ ating is used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; is there somebody who would say , &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my cell phone with laughter ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I will be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes may also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members un@@ pleasantly . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of mel@@ ted ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; other whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal plastic dishes can be viewed at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow the h@@ ash@@ tag # h@@ ash@@ tag in the h@@ ash@@ tag , &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , which de@@ votes itself to the supply of the restaurant industry . like the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the fight against drug traffi@@ ckers , &quot;

&quot; in reports in domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the bl@@ enders and killed regularly only appear in statistics . however , these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle ent@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drug bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ án , the chief of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background . &quot;
&quot; on the day after a violent incident , hardly anyone looks at the gri@@ eving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind every body , behind every bone discovery , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners , whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co created the digital project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; ( German : &quot; living with drug trafficking &quot; ) to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who are rub@@ bed into the struggle between the law enforcement agencies and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co describes the project as follows :
organised crime can not only be feared by our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches for his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ í@@ gu@@ ez , who lost her father only one day , her four sisters , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priests : &quot; &quot; as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task which we have set ourselves to go and look for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is called Antonio Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric business in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
&quot; on October 13 , he left the house . &quot;
&quot; on October 15th he should be back again , but he never came again . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta said : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me , because I am now alone with three children who need education . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but it does not pay them out because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get that ? &quot;
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , the frag@@ ility and the state leadership . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the state of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have been familiar with disease and sensation journ@@ alism for some years now .
&quot; every day I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I cannot be in@@ different or consider this as normal .
she continues to write :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug traffi@@ ckers ) when he is big . and it &apos;s not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ic deeds &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
for me this is as if they ridi@@ cu@@ le those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happened to them .
I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; the sen@@ sel@@ essness of men is incredible for me , when the death of six people and the enforced dis@@ appearances of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were &quot; &quot; rebel@@ li@@ ous &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to convince themselves that they are spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they are not stirring and still . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months of black@@ mail in the capital district : &quot; as a family with threats has been pl@@ under@@ ed . &quot; in this , it describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business for month until they end up destroying not only the business , but also their family apart . &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain never passes , the trauma stays , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want the others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap or kill you . &quot;
&quot; in these aw@@ ful days I asked if wines would dissolve my deepest feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I have to learn to live with the pain . &quot;
journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ ér@@ rez Vega published the article &quot; The For@@ gotten Kids of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ á@@ rez : a Generation of For@@ gotten Generation . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico &apos;s most dangerous city ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cooking potatoes , making tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; ch@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with him . this is his name for preparing the vial with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - in@@ expres@@ sible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years earlier , when he was just a few blocks away from his home , seeing the bloody corp@@ se of his father who was shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
&quot; born in Br@@ yan , the situation in Ju@@ á@@ rez looked like this : &quot;
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the fight against it mixed with the already existing social problems in Ju@@ á@@ rez .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 Ju@@ á@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Om@@ bud@@ sman for Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the public prosec@@ utor had 3@@ 103 kill@@ ings . this corresponds to 8.5 kill@@ ings a day . &quot;
these are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and inv@@ ade the country &apos;s soul .
&quot; only a few stories continue to live in the face of new head@@ lines , but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co , &quot; Animal Pol@@ í@@ ti@@ co 2015 launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to portra@@ y the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking that has tor@@ mented the country over the past four decades . &quot;
if a picture is worth a thousand immort@@ al words
sharing is Car@@ ing from Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ ström ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ UNG : this contribution and the pages to which it links contain pictures depicting violence .
the fact check is important in a moment when it comes to lifting a rum@@ or or expos@@ ing a for@@ gery .
&quot; but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to pers@@ ist . &quot;
let &apos;s take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its first release , it has been used irre@@ ver@@ sible to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; incorrect description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in the DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
&quot; in 2010 , a tank car crossed the place S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people died . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devast@@ ated . the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of battles that were difficult to navigate . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , one fell victim to that of the tan@@ ker lor@@ ries . &quot;
&quot; officials described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses including a movie theater near , which was full of people looking at the World Cup . &quot;
houses scattered and char@@ red corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned for lack of recognition .
&quot; a picture entitled &quot; This is Nigeria . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user Mysti@@ cal Monkey , January 12 , 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
it shows rows of stu@@ ffed bodies that are str@@ ung on the floor while people watch them .
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was taken up several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and wrong@@ ly attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , comb@@ at@@ ants of B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dramatically of atro@@ cities they had to flee .
houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one stayed behind to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said a resident to Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many had been dis@@ member@@ ed , shot or burned . &quot;
only on the basis of satellite images the follow @-@ up time could be illustrated .
&quot; the reason for the attack was also un@@ solved , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the B@@ oko Har@@ am &apos;s attempt to win the country ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
and here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack :
that is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments on Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one more step further , personal comments such as this example fal@@ sely fal@@ si@@ fy the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments . &quot;
the image of S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a warning message , published by the United Nations , those who were able to flee could strike blows , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts appeared like the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page , fal@@ sely claiming that the President &apos;s Th@@ ein Sein have said that monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . in addition , she had used the image from the DR Congo to see this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was last accessed on 26 April 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news organizations that called AF@@ P as their source also fal@@ sely attributed Th@@ ein Being this statement , but had not related the image of the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false dec@@ ou@@ tions go back to 2011 and 2012 and actually come from all over the world .
&quot; with the help of an &quot; &quot; reverse picture search &quot; , &quot; you can see how far information can transc@@ end boundaries . &quot;
&quot; an inver@@ ted picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures , which are very similar to the picture taken from the DR Congo . &quot;
&quot; they come from a mixture mas@@ h of private sites , social media platforms and common and national publications and are available in many languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have conveyed false reports , some have tried to expose the for@@ geri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of mis@@ use and associated with the respective countries , on the basis of what they have been published on which side they have been published . by this way , we want to show the range more clearly than through the language alone . &quot;
from the countries listed below ( which in some cases were also linked together ) several examples of ab@@ u@@ sive use come from .
here are some cases which can now be completely sen@@ sed ( on the map in orange ) :
map : news Fra@@ mes .
country examples of false coupl@@ ings of the image from the DR Congo with Nigeria or Myanmar .
the orange @-@ coloured countries point to pages or servers that are still available on the examples of fal@@ si@@ fications or false messages .
&quot; the countries in Gra@@ u are examples that , according to the metadata and information available via Tin@@ Eye , are probably also examples of fal@@ si@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; &quot; what is happening in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; &quot; war of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims &quot; . &quot; &quot;

&quot; one side , which ignor@@ es rum@@ ors , asked that the said photograph shows Christians killed by Muslims . &quot;
&quot; Canada , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; in this article , a blo@@ gger from Que@@ bec City not only identifies the fal@@ seh@@ ood but also discusses the abuse of the image from the DR Congo in connection with Nigeria as well as further questions about the intentions of the persons and the trage@@ dies involved in it ( in the DR Congo and beyond ) . &quot;
&quot; Ecuador , 2013 . &quot; &quot; Nigeria est@@ án qu@@ em@@ ando a los cr@@ isti@@ anos &quot; &quot; ( in Nigeria they burn the Christians ) . &quot;
&quot; in this article on explo@@ sions in North Kan@@ i in Nigeria , published in the newspaper La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , the neighborhood is identified as the Christian part of the place . &quot;
La Rep@@ ú@@ b@@ lica c@@ ites as its source the Spanish news agency EF@@ E ( where not known whether the original report has included the picture ) .
&quot; France , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; after the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , as this one used to illustrate the image of the DR Congo in order to illustrate the &quot; atro@@ cities of Islam , &quot; they have clearly seen no sites like Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster who refu@@ te this . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ ax@@ bu@@ ster named the incorrect use of the image since 2011 in conjunction with Nigeria , at that time promoted by a post by US , anti @-@ Islamic comment@@ ator P@@ am@@ ela G@@ eller . &quot;

&quot; Iran , 2012 . &quot;
a group of students of theology ( mul@@ la@@ hs ) in Islamic countries published an open letter to support Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims on the news agency N@@ asi@@ m and used the illustration of the DR Congo image .
&quot; Italy , 2015 . &quot;
a resident of the old town of P@@ ie@@ di@@ ca@@ stell@@ o von Tren@@ to posted this news on his side to express his solidarity with the massacre in Nigeria in 2015 .
&quot; Nigeria , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; even within Nigeria , the photo from the DR Congo became a proof of the bom@@ b@@ ings of B@@ oko Har@@ am in K@@ ano in public discussion forums . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Malaysia offers two extreme example of an ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo , expressing sympathy towards the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , and on the other hand the attempt of a blo@@ gger to deli@@ mit the claims , the Roh@@ ing@@ ya will be prosec@@ uted , as the photos were used ab@@ u@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the Myanmar government released a strai@@ gh@@ tening of what it meant as &quot; deliberately fin@@ alized news and photos , the international media , international human rights organisations and governments , in an attempt to create mis@@ understand@@ ings in respect of Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this judgment , published exclusively in English , also includes references to fake images of rum@@ ors that H@@ ate Spe@@ ech perform and used by extrem@@ ist groups to show that Muslims kill Budd@@ hi@@ sts and vice versa ( which is often spread by Burma nation@@ alists ) . &quot;
&quot; Russia , 2012 . &quot; &quot; F@@ aden@@ р@@ и@@ с@@ т@@ о@@ б@@ о@@ б@@ о@@ б@@ о@@ с@@ к@@ и@@ я &quot; &quot; ( Christi@@ an@@ opho@@ bia or political provo@@ cation ) . &quot;
&quot; this post , which addressed the members of the Russian Orthodox community , clearly states that the image of the DR Congo is NOT Muslims to kill Christians . &quot;
&quot; Saudi Arabia , 2012 / 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this news page fal@@ sely claimed that the President of Myanmar held Th@@ ein Sein in 2012 , that monks and politicians had participated in the killing of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims and brought the story together with the image of S@@ ange . &quot;
the article was updated in 2014 and the picture is still contained in it at the time of this release .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this article from 2014 on students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am , published by the news page An@@ á@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not originate from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that it represents a &quot; similar &quot; Ji@@ hadi@@ st attack . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture came into circulation later in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;
&quot; Turkey , 2015 . &quot; # Ni@@ jer@@ y@@ a@@ Yan@@ ı@@ y@@ or@@ ferti@@ y@@ a@@ U@@ y@@ u@@ y &quot; ( Nigeria is burning , the world sleeps ) . &quot;
&quot; the DR Congo image , signed with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims following the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve a greater level of attention to those events , allegedly taking place in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the picture was weather@@ ed as a proof of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times saved ) , but the messages connected with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the aim was to draw attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message , allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this one here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it to be false . &quot;
&quot; from the message contained in the DR Congo image , the organisation of the Clar@@ et@@ tin Mission@@ aries and Father Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos dis@@ soci@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; in other accounts , aggreg@@ ators and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in Gra@@ u ) , Tin@@ Eye also points out , but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared only clearly after the original review of 2010 , the picture may eventually have a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong topics or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that pass through these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photo was used with regard to larger discussions about silence in connection with the kill@@ ings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the m@@ ord@@ ings of Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the image to discuss how an African life is under@@ rated in comparison to a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is both important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images can be used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper question , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are ump@@ teen people who in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and ad@@ orn the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the dis@@ semination of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( here for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that holding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowled@@ ging the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , concern is that violent images will des@@ en@@ si@@ tise readers and viewers , and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( for example , this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media work to help others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent portra@@ y@@ als in the news media , it is a fact that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists are experim@@ enting with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; fake news &quot; . &quot; you will need to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , which can actually be removed from context or in a completely ab@@ u@@ sive way . &quot;
&quot; however , any investigation of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog called un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e. g. un@@ intel@@ li@@ gible ) stri@@ ves to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not at all to translate . &quot;
these words exist in each language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
&quot; some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well @-@ known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others , which are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example the Spanish so@@ bre@@ mes@@ a ) . &quot;
but everyone stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly resist every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression is not enough , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are required to understand exactly what is meant by this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to focus on small languages . &quot;
&quot; in the blog you can find , for example , words from the VAT @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; &quot; - Take care of your parents in recognition of how you have stri@@ ved for you in your younger years . &quot;
&quot; and words in the H@@ uns@@ rik language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after you have war@@ med up in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they def@@ y other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , how we analyze the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this page want to publish more of these &quot; irre@@ plac@@ eable &quot; words , showing how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of the &quot; Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , &quot; which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite photos here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka is dealing with the worst floo@@ ding of the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood and disaster disaster in this decade .
&quot; due to heavy rainf@@ alls the rivers Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ wal@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya in 15 districts in the south and west of the country have stepped over the shore . &quot;
&quot; after a statement by the disaster centre of Sri Lanka from 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and almost hundreds of people are missing because of the floods and slu@@ dges . &quot;
&quot; more than 400@@ ,000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and around 100,000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe places of residence . &quot;
&quot; rain falls on Saturday ( 27 May ) , and the water levels in some areas slowly returned . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the extent of the flood disaster :
floo@@ ding in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water levels of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et provide regular updates to flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the extent of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods exac@@ erb@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever crisis , warns Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; this morning the N@@ elu@@ wa bus stood in the floo@@ d@@ water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded due to the water level of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a . &quot;
the Air Force has provided five air@@ planes for rescue operations and further five are made ready for transport of emergency supplies to residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and start @-@ ups are also ready to help .
Facebook pages like Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry food and essential goods for flood victims -
we are today in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ but@@ ana .
please call 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 if animals need help in this area .
the taxi call app Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ ac@@ enter is informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; &quot; flood aid &quot; &quot; button which allowed users to call a vehicle to pick up assistance and donations . these were then transmitted to the s@@ ri@@ lan@@ k@@ ische Red Cross for free . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than one thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for floo@@ ding and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the united efforts of the Government and the civilian population of Sri Lanka , where several social media platforms are fully exploited , bring residents in need of security and provide relief measures . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of other human lives , whereby the population of Sri Lanka is now the long way to restore norm@@ ality . &quot;

the Women &apos;s March on 21 January 2017 in San Francisco .
photo by Sah@@ ar Hab@@ i@@ b G@@ haz@@ i .
in January I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend .
&quot; I trust my four year old daughter , she entru@@ sts me to her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in the last minute , we call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we grant rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some hold the iconic image of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , tied from an American flag , others gu@@ ise slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my friend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , aren &apos;t you ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslims ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who know me for years separate me - the Sah@@ ar , who know them - from the widespread concept of &quot; Muslims &quot; that has built up in their imagination . &quot;
they kidn@@ apped me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not all look the same .
we practice our religion differently .
&quot; we identify with it to be a Muslim , in different ways . but somehow we are all inserted into the same Muslim drawer . &quot;
&quot; this drawer is so well constructed in our collective conception that as soon as Muslims , which as I do not fit in , have to be ab@@ used . &quot;
stabili@@ zation of the muscles
I don &apos;t stand alone with it .
&quot; this is even done to the poet , whose poetry is most widely sold in America : Rum@@ i . &quot;
what images do you think of when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
as Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I was now he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar .
&quot; Islam , the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died , the center of his poetry . &quot;
&quot; but in the western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was removed , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
another is the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims who have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries .
this temp@@ ting image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid dis@@ integrated the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures also prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to perpet@@ u@@ ate them . &quot;
&quot; for thirteen years I worked in the news industry for thirteen years , and I have seen how these powerful , er@@ ron@@ eous Nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led nine Muslim women to their countries over the last three decades , while the US won &apos;t even choose their first female presidential candidate in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to recognize that when French , Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabian , Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body that these are both two sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group ex@@ erts his &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong narrative weak@@ ens Muslim women who conduct movements for change .
it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans that were hi@@ jack@@ ed with slave ships .
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
this narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and er@@ ron@@ e@@ ously that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children become the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and har@@ ass@@ ment .
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just a fear of Islam , religion , but fear of &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion
&quot; in the news industry , we are doing more than telling stories based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
and we have failed to make up seven million Muslims in the highest degree &quot; diverse &quot; religious groups in America .
more than a third of the total Muslim population are African @-@ racial Americans .
&quot; six of ten American Muslims belong to the first @-@ generation immigrants , who come from 77 countries . &quot;
the parents of the author 1976 in New York .
use approved .
four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents came to New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother laid her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in New York sky@@ scra@@ pers ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American st@@ atics from Bangladesh , with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; back then , when Khan remembered the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were not Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of getting out of my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chiefs , whom all Muslims carry in themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ ure , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we do not have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be chosen almost always for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of outstanding Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists trying to fight widespread lies about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the ongoing tape of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated anti @-@ corruption machine with credi@@ tors , think tanks and experts for false information , which is our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is ; or what Islam is , manipul@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and because of the nature in which we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is in more than just a stranger that tears the head@@ sc@@ arf to a woman . &quot;
&quot; or as the sc@@ ary map of attacks on mos@@ ques across the US , see below . &quot;

Islam@@ opho@@ bia in its ug@@ ly forms acc@@ esses our affili@@ ation .
&quot; it attacks our identity , which is so extensive , so versatile and complex that it cannot fit into a drawer . &quot;

use approved .
I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was only then born into my imagination when I was four years old , in a provisional mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ tery church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they refer back to the following terms : faith , behaviour and belonging . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behaviour may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbor , would see my rock in the surf , that I am Muslims if they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; it would see the ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter , when I held her in my arms and whis@@ per her the Arabic verses to the protection that seals the Koran and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each one of them repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that she is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;
&quot; the grandmother of the author , when she wins an Ik@@ eb@@ ana competition in Kar@@ achi , posed with her sisters at some point in the 1960s . &quot;
use approved .
&quot; belonging is the image of my grandmother on the mat@@ ernal side with her sisters , as they gained a competition of art of floral arrangements in Kar@@ achi for decades . &quot;
&quot; it is the picture of her that I can see in that moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and un@@ finished paintings painted Su@@ fi hot@@ spot ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters that it can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Muslims means speaking the prayers that she told me to speak if I have a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who - over the centuries - was colon@@ ized by an &quot; empire &quot; which a company called hon@@ orable British Ost@@ ini@@ dien company , it has a deep meaning to call God my only Lord . &quot;
the author 1987 with her grandfather .
use approved .
&quot; belonging means growing up and hearing that men do not cry , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather cries . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an un@@ wrapped around his family in India ruled K@@ ash@@ mir , family , whom he was not allowed to close in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians whose families , as with my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have divided the Muslim world as at the risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims means to know that in the last two centuries , Europeans have all been colon@@ ized to four Muslim lands . &quot;
it means knowing that the first pilot bomb of the story was dropped from a century ago over a Muslim country .
&quot; it means to know that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , ash@@ mir@@ ian sub@@ tan of the British empire , was called &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , since he was the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled to more parts of the world than I ever was and preached the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to my Muslim tribe of 1.7 billion people go deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
&quot; it means to remember that fourteen years ago the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed over every continent apart from the Antar@@ ctic , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half a million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the rub@@ ble of the war .
to be an American Muslim means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 per cent since 2001 .
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy comes to the US and the susp@@ ects we@@ ars a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ in . &quot;
&quot; it means to know that fourteen hundred years ago the first call of prayer , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave called Bil@@ al . &quot;
it means to know that two hundred years ago an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Muhammad was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this land .
it means to call Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the heat that I sen@@ sed when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life count .
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani , a K@@ ash@@ mir@@ i , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim and a journalist means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple d@@ ashes but to fail to communicate them to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of 1.7 billion ent@@ ails more possibilities than a sor@@ cer@@ er cube , but is represented in the reducing ambig@@ u@@ ity &quot; we &quot; against it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means caring for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged individuals build structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility consists of the Muslim registry , which began with President Bush and extended under President Obama . &quot;
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
it consists of immigration officials who take a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
it is in a country that closes its borders to people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly list &quot; , &quot; which is mainly targeted by Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
&quot; it is the wars that we lead , and the bombs that we shed on Muslim lands . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically correct image and asked them to judge groups on a scale of 1 to 100 with respect to evolution . &quot;
Muslims got the lowest score .
the conversations we have to lead
we are too deeply concerned to sof@@ ten the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we are back for decades to recognize the roots of our fears , and the fla@@ wed and dangerous prints that we make in our news editorial offices . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement led by American Muslims within the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history . &quot;
&quot; pod@@ cast See Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing of Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the pod@@ cast # Good@@ Muslim Bad@@ Muslim ; the vir@@ ale video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square about black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ ster Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim writers and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super hero@@ ine - all this makes me hope . &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global time in which we are .
and this moment has consequences that go beyond the 1.7 billion .
&quot; there is a reason for conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now leading the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
there is another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years before , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but that made me an irre@@ vo@@ cable Muslim today . &quot;
things I left here like a bread crust in my speech .
&quot; things that perhaps wake up memories , as in all the inter@@ sections that make up our humanity may be a story where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the bridge in Berkeley , conversations in the context of the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia are taking place . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics talk about our problems with &quot; &quot; others &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but these are not concepts which we usually throw in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers .

we all need to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where however Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are led and people by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in the public presentation , had been scientific about Stan@@ ford four decades ago . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions according to the role of being aware and un@@ consciously the &quot; &quot; others &quot; &quot; ; as it feeds my girlfriend and I in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the occupation that we have no president , the chocolate cake , while he has already broken up countries and &quot; &quot; other made &quot; &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art aims to preserve urban language diversity
&quot; story telling , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a way to get in touch with someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) , the number of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written word but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or O@@ ak@@ land in the United States where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are .
&quot; while &quot; listening frequently is often associated with understanding , &quot; these events instead &quot; listen &quot; instead &quot; listening , &quot; in order to appreciate , to touch . &quot;
&quot; in this format , stor@@ yt@@ ellers publish their story in their own language first and translate or explain it in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not a professional story t@@ eller , their devotion and their representation lead to the audience being involved . &quot;
they evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso , which is told in the language Daf@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art that are typical for their country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ am@@ ara tells the tale of the rab@@ bit and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona of Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his fa@@ bel , John Ny@@ am@@ ara asks : &quot; how is that to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a wide gr@@ in he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you have listened to !
they were attentive ...
they were all with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organizers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own story stories . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for re @-@ establishment of sovereign debt from the US
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which amounted to 72 million US dollars , various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 . the march started at the Vatican Cap@@ it@@ ol , the government building of the capital , and proc@@ eeded to the Plaza de Col@@ ón in the old town of San Ju@@ ans . &quot;
it was proclaimed by the group &quot; Fren@@ te Ci@@ u@@ dad@@ ano p@@ or la Audi@@ tor@@ ía de la Deu@@ da &quot; ( Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Front for the Neur@@ ons of D@@ ebt ) and the ec@@ umen@@ ical church meeting Puerto Ri@@ cos .
the advoc@@ ates of re@@ establishing the debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States .
this is their demand :
&quot; the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for debt are to be held ac@@ countable for their corruption . &quot;
&quot; we call for a financial audit and an Ste@@ ering Committee without personal interest in public debt , with a fixed , our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favor of the economy . &quot;
we are black@@ ma@@ iled and oppressed .
the people of Puerto Ri@@ cos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs .
we will not choose between education and health .
our pen@@ sion@@ ers will not be able to reconci@@ le with falling pension payments .
we demand immediate action .
the island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - is suffering from a severe financial crisis .
&quot; therefore , the so @-@ called &quot; Centre for New Economy , &quot; an independent non @-@ profit organisation without party affili@@ ation , proposes a law on the socio @-@ economic development , a law on state responsibility , as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority . &quot;
these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure .
&quot; without the participation and conviction of the citizens , measures imposed on the outside will be at risk of being rejected by the people . &quot;
the demonstration called the name &quot; Night watch for light and truth . &quot;
here are some impressions :

&quot; the Syrian @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he has done for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual digital culture conference held in Berlin , dedicated itself to an event of the # Free@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; Mé@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ üh@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Refle@@ iry ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is freely available here , contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it says :
this book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs are with which this is connected .
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to make some sense from our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ou@@ il , the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was removed from the directory of the A@@ dra prison , in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 . &quot;
since then we have no information about its current state or residence .
&quot; the introductory part of his book entitled &quot; &quot; Collec@@ tive Memory &quot; &quot; gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and wanting to know him back in his normal life and in freedom . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture , many of us have begun to think about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we choose ?
what have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs ?
&quot; since March 2012 , the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government authorities . &quot;
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el was transferred from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military establishment , to an unknown location . &quot;
&quot; his wife , the writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly confidential &quot; command of the military court from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; his where@@ ab@@ outs , however , remain unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
&quot; maybe none of Bas@@ sels &apos;s cultural prototypes were more likely than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 , in order to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ras . &quot;
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations and here gre@@ ek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Bass@@ el did not know that ten years after he began working with this work , the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens , but the world . &quot;
&quot; this expedition into the digital arch@@ e@@ ology and preservation has created a time capsule , which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
&quot; I spent my entire life with it , dreaming of freedom and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace it . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med when I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was in jail . &quot;
&quot; I have learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked him . he has taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how to use computers , at least theoretically , without actually holding one in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ z@@ uch that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012 @-@ 2015 when he was in jail . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together on the book for one year .
&quot; she smu@@ g@@ gled the lyrics to him , when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English . &quot;
the book is freely available .
book cover by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here &apos;s an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It happens &quot; :
&quot; it happens at every visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the crowds of jail
and I enter into every detail of your voice and words
&quot; who I carry with passion with me , &quot;
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
&quot; to bring back all the moments , &quot;
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the detention of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; a year goes by , my soul &quot;
during the course of time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still In the cage of monsters
Bas@@ le &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , according to the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those arrested or disappeared under violence by the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; by 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention since 2011 . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
today we reiter@@ ate our demand in the hope that we have to do this for the last time .
Mozambique : due to corruption convic@@ ted director after release date back to previous post
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption case , in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his sentence to which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defend@@ ants for an in@@ version of 54 million Me@@ tik@@ al ( about 800 000 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds from the Mozambique airports , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for his re @-@ employment to the company , which happened on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic , which exemp@@ li@@ fied the motion , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to refer back to his old post as the company did not take any disciplinary proceedings after his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not mean the action well . &quot;
&quot; the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ ú@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , a local institution committed to public transparency , condemned the decision of the company to resume the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the firm should also initiate disciplinary proceedings against the contrary .
&quot; however , the company apparently held no reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ í@@ dio V@@ az , a significant voice in the Muslim social media , also re@@ jects this behavior and looks at the case as &quot; disgu@@ ised &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za was a competent guy , he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and of which half had served . &quot;
&quot; he could hold paid talks and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he has agreed to be re@@ integrated into the company , which he helped inflic@@ t damage . &quot;
therefore it is obvious : Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence .
re@@ fut@@ able !
&quot; Bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says , the director no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ted him , I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insul@@ ted the state so massi@@ vely . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks morality and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead only served itself by the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money , and the state itself has become tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ ú@@ te prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind a th@@ ief in prison : &quot;
thi@@ eves belong to Sam@@ ora Pr@@ ison prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president but also as a sharp thin@@ ker and - by the way - proph@@ etic speakers .
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations was when he affir@@ med that &quot; an ambitious man is capable of everything , even the father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that he is not like that . he changes tactics , but he does not turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious man is at the same time criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also rej@@ ecting : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he sat 10 years and came free . &quot;
&quot; and today , the company , in which he tre@@ mb@@ les money , is under contract . # As@@ sim@@ V@@ ai@@ O@@ M@@ eu@@ Pa@@ is - я@@ Alpha Trans@@ l@@ ations ( @ az@@ mal _ Ra@@ fik ) May 12 , 2017 &quot;
E@@ mil@@ do Sam@@ bo from the journal @ Ver@@ da@@ de ( in German : @ Truth ) states that crimin@@ ality pays off in Mozambique :

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users wrong@@ ly
&quot; the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ a or bac@@ on . &quot;
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the well @-@ known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although it is still discussed about the origin of the word , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; Indian . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; in Burma &quot; &quot; as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely depreci@@ ating con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; Kal@@ ar &apos;@@ is normally associated with racism today , but the word itself does not automatically invoke hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that also posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word , have been cens@@ ored for use of the word . &quot;
&quot; in addition , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same character sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair on Bur@@ m@@ ese is also written &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters , as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ king A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to ease his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the phrase &quot; &quot; healing &quot; &quot; ( ku ) + the question word ( la ) on Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression very much , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different responses to the initiative of Facebook .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it removes all the posts that would be suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it automatically filters the word .
automati@@ sm will not understand what you write to Fac@@ eb@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the opposite words .
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , receive a fairly good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who propag@@ ates hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not last long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China such as S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that cens@@ orship is often a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was banned from the social network :
... &quot; when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook , I made a mail to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to edit , post and share content for 24 hours because the post &quot; &quot; Facebook Community standards &quot; . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his views on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes to have a ben@@ evol@@ ent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ ing such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and thus banned words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover , that would be great . &quot;
fac@@ ebook automatic cens@@ orship has provided a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users are now funny about Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which didn &apos;t have a hate speech but nevertheless removed : &quot;
with permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ a cur@@ ry and watch an Indian film .
&quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail , which contains the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post says &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , then heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; over the past five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks should additionally raise violence in the communities in Myanmar , especially in the Rak@@ h@@ ine region , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised for his failure to bring out the ramp@@ ant hate speech on his Bur@@ m@@ ese sides . &quot;
&quot; but instead of simply cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have looked better on the context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad &amp; # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is ending with the chil@@ dr@@ ens
a wedding ring in the sand .
&quot; photo by Der@@ ek Gav@@ ey , CC B@@ Y 2.0 . &quot;
the children &apos;s marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the country &apos;s parliament unanim@@ ously approved a law bann@@ ing this practice so that the age of marriage is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; before this change of marriage , some of the members of Hind@@ i and Muslim religious communities held firm in practice , and in May 2016 , Brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( I@@ RO ) , said that the state should not interfere with the state , since the age of age does not determine maturity . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago are a contractual partner of the UN Child Right Convention , the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; &quot; every person under 18 &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; statistics of the UN for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago was 2.8 percent , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements that were eager to abol@@ ish laws for child@@ birth followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . undoubtedly , they helped to bring about this result . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no hes@@ itation in saying to the critics of the children , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really un@@ complicated matter , and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the bill . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was decided - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent , which contained , so that he could be discussed in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him a law . &quot;
now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced .
&quot; one of the country &apos;s sen@@ ators gave a status update on Facebook , which again posted Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle on Inst@@ agra@@ m : &quot;
&quot; Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ res@@ at : the bill against the children &apos;s marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes for it , and no one against it . &quot;
&quot; once it has been approved in the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
&quot; the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws of child@@ birth have finally been changed . &quot;
&quot; member of the Federal Ministry of Education , Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk that obsc@@ ured the core of the matter , but do you know what ? child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and this is worth almost every price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which states : &quot; &quot; news ! &quot;
the marriage network has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for that - 0 on the other ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group that openly talked about the importance of the adoption of the law , noted : &quot;
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft to change the marriage network was decided today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 de@@ pu@@ ties in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
all de@@ pu@@ ties voted against have voted for the law .
the children &apos;s marriage is no longer permitted in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ birth atten@@ d@@ ants .
many thanks to all the activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a Thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most famous Hind@@ u organization in the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take judicial steps , the law should be passed , and he seems to accept his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , a pro@@ pon@@ ent of the law , said that it was quite legitimate when Mahar@@ aj wanted to act against the law , most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l suggested :
&quot; instead of talking about the problem , instead of talking about the problem that we , instead of talking about the problem , we would simply say that the state that protects our daughters from being mis@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men who are facing them in the advantage of them , would you then be prepared to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to court action against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world where the children are legal or still the norm in various gra@@ dations , although there are laws that prohi@@ bit them . &quot;

&quot; by mirr@@ oring web pages , Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content again &quot;
&quot; the Wikipedia page was presented internationally by the SO@@ PA ( Stop Online Privacy Act ) and P@@ IP@@ A copyright legislation in the USA on January 18 , 2012 . &quot;
created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for over a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle based en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day by day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series fight against the block@@ age .
&quot; although many tech @-@ sav@@ vy internet users are used to use conver@@ sions for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third @-@ largest VPN pre@@ valence in the world ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008 , as recently described in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 , after the Internet Law ( Nr. 56@@ 51 ) has been adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second best @-@ known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform continues to remain locked , several M@@ irr@@ ors pages ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated ) have now appeared . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentr@@ alized peer @-@ to @-@ peer network ( i.e. host computer connections ) , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete breakdown difficult . &quot;
&quot; despite the legal ban , the content is available . &quot;
&quot; in a blog post , IP@@ FS reports about its efforts : &quot;
&quot; after listening to the news ( about the blocking of Wikipedia ) , we put it all on putting snap@@ shots from Wikipedia on the IP@@ FS platform . so there is the possibility to read the content in distributed and distributed ways . &quot;
&quot; this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content , even if they cannot reach the website www.@@ wi@@ ki@@ pedia . &quot;
&quot; IP@@ FS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Foundation , and it is merely screen@@ shots and no live or dynamic versions of the website . &quot;
&quot; however , Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia was involved in other efforts to circum@@ vent the lock . &quot;
&quot; Cr@@ istian Con@@ son@@ ni of Wi@@ k@@ im@@ edia Italy has both tr@@ .@@ vi@@ ki@@ an@@ si@@ klo@@ pedia , a M@@ irr@@ or@@ seite of Wikipedia , as well as Wiki@@ Mir@@ ror , an open source project that anyone can use to host similar M@@ irr@@ ors pages when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked . &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the necessity for nature conservation
&quot; a su@@ hl@@ ent r@@ hin@@ o@@ cer@@ os , ch@@ it@@ wan . &quot;
photo by Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i .

&quot; Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with badly positioned motifs and well @-@ balanced colors . &quot;
this motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
at that time he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar has tried to bring Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , right next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how this first @-@ class location in his work helps :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
&quot; I was right at home when suddenly Re@@ j@@ az@@ aj ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida Lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father , that on the bank of the Rap@@ ti River a le@@ op@@ ard would be . &quot;
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was and I immediately started to kn@@ it pictures ! ! &quot;
&quot; Sag@@ ar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal , and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as fear@@ ful as they look . &quot;
&quot; and he should know &#91; it &#93; , for he stood by face to face from face to face : &quot;
a tiger can not be bot@@ her@@ ed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness , when the king of the book suddenly appeared . he sat down immediately , we see ourselves and he star@@ es me through the sc@@ arf @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; I click for conservation &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on his photos . &quot;
&quot; however , his passion for the promotion of Nep@@ al@@ ese nature and wildlife is not always easy . &quot;
&quot; he waited for 22 days , mostly living in a tent to take pictures of Ot@@ tern in Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took him to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation . &quot;
check out some of these photos below .

&quot; this post was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ ts@@ a and was originally published on Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international community media organization from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , women avoid the utmost care to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
instead they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; father of my child . &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure , as well as the fear of the consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm in keeping this practice alive . &quot;
&quot; last year , Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was sentenced by a sha@@ m in the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and viol@@ ated by her family and the village community after addressing a married couple with names . &quot;
&quot; the tradition of nam@@ ing their wives also not by name is also common among men . however , they have far fewer rights to fear if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in P@@ une , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health personnel and house@@ wives , joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place for them alone to discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
&quot; as one of the 56 clubs there are in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign , which is run by the community Video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and sets up for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ was has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as children &apos;s marriage to exile from HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and manages this club . &quot;
it reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
&quot; the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in her discussion rounds , acted by women who did not call her hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women could easily identify .
&quot; speaking out of the name of her hus@@ bands is a custom , which they are all du@@ tiful and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini believes :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never named her husband on behalf of her , wanted to try out at home , as it is . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini tells :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended .
&quot; Prak@@ ash , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him by his name . &quot;
Roh@@ ini started his first discussion club with this confidence in his luggage .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patri@@ archy &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
at the beginning of the round Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h .
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us as they want , this means that they don &apos;t respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ?
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they gave the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z from the village of Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of an age @-@ old tradition in which married women can never pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini tells :
&quot; a woman was so shy that she only ch@@ ased herself in the whole practice , another she decided to release the whole frustr@@ ated fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing it . &quot;
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the adren@@ alin rush of having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided that they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands at home . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the next few days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head : his wife could not stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
another woman said : &quot; Roh@@ ini meant I should do it .
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as carrying the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot on the forehead , indicating the mar@@ ital status : &quot;
why do women only have to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband that I would carry the zin@@ no@@ ber@@ red dot , if he did . &quot;
he only laugh@@ ed and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not stopped completely with it , but think that they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we make a trip to each discussion club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to worry about who could hear something , &quot; she says . &quot;
in recent months she celebrated her own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in her life ; she danced and sang and talked about things she had never thought about before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things , such as our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things out loud , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a panel discussion , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have only supported sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted to wear a sal@@ ine cur@@ ta , a wide shirt over a pair of pants , they did not dare . &quot;
&quot; after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code , morality associated with the sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own pair of Kur@@ tas ( Ober@@ hem@@ den ) into a discussion round so that women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to plan a trip to Go@@ a , where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club , Roh@@ ini confirms that things are moving slowly : &quot;
so far we have only made small steps .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then they stopped saying the name of their husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including myself , are still doing it , but only when they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two continue to say the name of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now carry Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their foreh@@ e@@ ads at any time .
the women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or choice of clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how to explain Roh@@ ini :
each one of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am it too .
but this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not only limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do .
we are all sitting in the same boat .

the visit of the Beat@@ les in 1966 in Japan is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war period .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les in London in 1964 , marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
it became clear to people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many famous Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language like English , &quot; said Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , President of the retailer Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;

the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! made a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
the same thing we did last year too .

bald men are dra@@ gged and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia warned the people that bald men could be the target of attacks in Mozambique .
&quot; photo : An@@ other Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of bald men for organ trafficking , presumably for un@@ believers , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and part of the organs had been removed .
two men were arrested and subsequently they conc@@ eded that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia explained to the BBC . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of murder for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN in South African country led a mission to investigate this practice .
&quot; the persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in the neighboring country of Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to fight this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ com@@ be We@@ ya lives in the city of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those who are going to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to bald men , who travel to Mozambique , are the goal of ritual attacks , warned the Moz@@ ambi@@ can police after the latest assass@@ inations of three men of bald men due to their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ lied Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and resident of the town of In@@ ham@@ gang in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of bald men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , province of Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zia , for supposedly dis@@ believing rituals , has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief exists , according to which the victims in the head might have power , the riches generate . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems were murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; on Facebook , Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the Chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa , who indicated that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty facing Mozambique : &quot;
&quot; I would like to be attracted to E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , TH@@ AT S@@ ICH is ashamed of a country where people would be ashamed to claim sex against good notes , work and other services , a nation in which people would be ashamed to earn sex against good grades , a nation in which people would not hurt or even their lives to earn their bread , a country where men would not be bald or bald for dis@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some of them could not be missed . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mak@@ ado , scientist from Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and enthusiastic Twitter bene@@ fici@@ aries , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the district Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Pedro Sap@@ hir , as well as the police spokesperson Zam@@ b@@ é@@ zi@@ as , In@@ á@@ cio D@@ ina , both smo@@ k@@ war@@ p are : &quot;
the Moz@@ ambi@@ can authorities are concerned very much about the mur@@ ders of bald men .

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for the medical treatment of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates and Dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia that was probably made recently .
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
&quot; the case of the imprisoned Chinese dis@@ sident , Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years in prison for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( state threats ) , having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o demanding democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
&quot; the State Department in China referred to Li@@ us case as an &quot; &quot; internal affair &quot; &quot; and told a speaker , he considered it &quot; &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community to release Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him a treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critic@@ ised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ ar@@ ised some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment whether the United Nations should ex@@ ert pressure to allow Li@@ u to be treated abroad . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ ør@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us Release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt , after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Li@@ u , although the Norwegian government said that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
&quot; diplomatic relations were continued only in December last year . only in June , Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon imports to China , as exports since 2010 were largely blocked . &quot;
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his price . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ ats of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called on China to release Li@@ u as announced in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to raise all restrictions on Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife as well as family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all the visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
us in the USA
&quot; U.S. ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad informed that the Americans would like him to have the opportunity to treat abroad , in so far as it would help him in his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman for the US Embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the message agency AF@@ P announced on June 27 that the message told the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from her house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the call of the US embassy attracted a fur@@ ious response from China , with the exterior of the State Department that &quot; no country has the right to interfere and make ir@@ responsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs . &quot; &quot;
Pol@@ ley told that China should offer the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which it claims according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I urge China to un@@ condition@@ ally release Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate # Li@@ u@@ Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , so that he can get into proper medical treatment . ht@@ t@@ p : / / bit@@ .@@ ly / 2@@ t@@ E@@ 6@@ k@@ U@@ o &quot;
Germany : Germany
&quot; German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on July 3 , Berlin , hoping that Li@@ u &quot; gets all the medical support he needs &quot; and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing the news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had great concerns , whether the vor@@ tex of Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada - Canada
&quot; on 28 June , Canadian Ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called China to provide Li@@ u an adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us attorney told AF@@ P earlier that Li@@ u &apos;s wife , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to speak and contact with someone outside , including his lawyers . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; Canada calls on China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including free speech and freedom of expression . &quot;
France and France
&quot; in an Declaration on 29 June , the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs called on China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all the treatments he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and his family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the State Department announced that there is no further information on whether France would eventually take it . &quot;
Taiwan and the United States
&quot; the Council of continental Affairs in Taiwan urged China to release Li@@ u on 27 June , and show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;

&quot; the spiritual guide in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , expressed himself very anxi@@ ously in a statement on 28 June about Li@@ u and admitted that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us wellbeing . &quot;
he said about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious , stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I felt personally very moved and also encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ck , Singapore should be considered a city . &quot;
this remark has triggered a debate in the blo@@ gos@@ ph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of the single political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supports Singapore to be considered a city .
... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people make a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; twist the logic &quot; in order to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore .
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , we can say that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose land is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ck were not very pos@@ h : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in view of it , he seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities that are permanently led by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once one reaches the core point of the subject , the good old corp@@ se appears again from the authorit@@ arian rulers who pre@@ tend to be demo@@ crats , leaving the distorted logic because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end the last week of Sh@@ an@@ gl@@ ams gave answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system really non @-@ answers . &quot;
he explained the corresponding questions with non @-@ rep@@ lies ration@@ ally .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng asks Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ck to clarify his opinion , since she did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ck would take the effort to clarify this point as long as he was paid high to be part of the Government of Singapore .
&quot; by publishing his commentary on the blog , he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire tran@@ script of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ck , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said that Singapore was rather a &quot; &quot; city &quot; &quot; than a country , &quot; &quot; he explained why the elections in Singapore were so uneven , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is not a country , he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ck , who , as leader of a growing generation , makes such a pol@@ em@@ ic statement . &quot;
&quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old Guard , what I expected - be I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ck , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it , and is aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K Review cr@@ ushes the weak points of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; has Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ck made a mistake &quot; &quot; believing a mistake &quot; &quot; or was it an advocate of Freu@@ dian ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back ? &quot;
&quot; Singapore is unique , it is both country and city . &quot;
&quot; since he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ ck are of grave importance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , but do they defend their city , but not their country ? &quot;
who does our prime minister have to pay back invoices ?
what is the value of our pink identity card ?
are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore is and has always been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , &quot; etc . , but that is not quite correct . &quot;
we should rather talk about the defence of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; cute Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
global Vo@@ ices recently asked his editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ?
&quot; your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series , with the rum@@ ors uncovered about certain parts of the world and a different fac@@ et is to be shown . &quot;
&quot; the latest part of this series is from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , editor of Global Vo@@ ices Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question that is most asked to me in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ?
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I live and back in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on what situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ ite to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication mostly follows the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans probably cook in anger if they are kept for Americans , but I don &apos;t mind that . &quot;
&quot; for someone who does not know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans use a Canadian flag well visible on their back@@ pack when travelling .
all the dear Canadi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ les on their baggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbors .
we have a free healthcare !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everybody seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
&quot; we evi@@ dently say very often &quot; &quot; sorry . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Canada is also considered to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not as these guys at the south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate this .
&quot; first of all , I have many American friends , which I admire very much . &quot;
&quot; it wouldn &apos;t matter to me if you would change me , for example , with Johnny from Dallas . &quot;
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first : to be called &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; means to be sp@@ uri@@ ous - like the ben@@ ign , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; Die Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has one &apos;s Canadian double @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada is really a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing to push . &quot;
being harmless means to be in@@ conspic@@ uous and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around one . &quot;
&quot; I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone , is a major achievement of Canadi@@ ans . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
&quot; what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; &quot; nice &quot; &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans don &apos;t often talk about the fence across the fence .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
luckily for us ( and for the rest of the world ) J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau came on stage to show Canadi@@ ans are more than &apos; nice &apos; .
music video of a pop @-@ band par@@ o@@ dy Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a music video , famous in Thailand , has released a music video that par@@ o@@ ds the jun@@ ta , which seized power in 2014 , and despite its promise to restore the civilian government , the country continues to reign . &quot;
&quot; the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man , who tells of what regulations his girlfriend makes . &quot;
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video refers directly to the continued military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a huge success .
&quot; in the first three days alone , the video uploaded on Facebook was 1,@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , even the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists told the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Jun@@ ta domination . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos , which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has consistently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may relate to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives absolute decision @-@ making over important national issues to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army . &quot;
&quot; the 11th rule : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious program to &quot; change the imagination &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other people who are considered critics by the jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose a new unit was established in the army , supervised online content and persons accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy , prosec@@ uted . &quot;
Thailand stri@@ ves stri@@ k@@ ingly against &quot; Most Maj@@ estic &quot; ( Maj@@ estic insul@@ t ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was declared in Thailand . &quot;
two days later it came to a coup of the army .
&quot; one of the problems that the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is its decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money . &quot;
&quot; in the video , it is even shown how people are tos@@ sed into a black vans , before putting them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison , because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and internet users are threatened with long sentences , they should off@@ end the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the te@@ aser of the song members of the band , which im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Hunger Games , &quot; was already being used by Putin &apos;s opponents during protests in 2014 . &quot;
life continues in the ruins of ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and is published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society recovered very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , above all in the district of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ash@@ an war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still visible in this part of the Republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al show striking pictures .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ bour@@ ava are located in the hydro@@ carb@@ ons of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups such as Russians , Greeks , Sh@@ ar @-@ Asia , Geor@@ gi@@ ans and Armen@@ ians lived and worked together in Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , most of the Russians and ch@@ oses live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period there were still more than 10,000 people , today there are only a few hundred people in these gh@@ o@@ sts . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic of T@@ ku@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district has been 16@@ ,000 people , having hardly climbed over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , approximately 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot;
&quot; the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s , called K@@ hr@@ ush@@ ch@@ uk@@ ho@@ v@@ kas , stand symbo@@ lically for the decline and the devast@@ ation of the region . &quot;
the buildings are ruined and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha I met a local older man .
he begins a conversation and it is difficult for him to finish this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; why talk ?
&quot; it is nevertheless unique . &quot; &quot; &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were local centres , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens , all served by the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded magni@@ fic@@ ence buildings .
the people who once lived in this place and contributed their contribution to the central planning of the Soviet Union have now left the district .
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha about fifty inhabitants live .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ ow@@ ka , which houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies , where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in their hand , they immediately withdraw . &quot;
&quot; our mother prohibited us from photograph@@ ing , &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she just prohibited us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she leaves the destroyed building and disappears .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ arch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as livestock , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to come across the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the District Administration supplies free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago an older woman named Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as she is called in the neighborhood ) from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her oldest daughter living in France , Gal@@ ina did not leave Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will remain forever in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says . &quot;
Gal@@ ina does not want to receive any financial help from her daughter and insi@@ sts that instead she supports her young grand@@ children .
Gal@@ inas monthly pension are just nine dollars .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a vegetable garden or a house , it &apos;s very hard to survive , &quot; she says . &quot;
a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells us that she and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; &quot; &quot; a 90 @-@ year @-@ old woman and a young family and I live in this building . &quot;
&quot; if you are on holiday , visit us . &quot;
but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbor appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; a@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha lived together with her husband and the five common children in their home for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
&quot; every day , they remember the village life before the war . &quot;
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia simply broke away ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave it . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital city of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
Nat@@ ascha is receiving approximately $ 9 children &apos;s money for each child .
her husband works in the coal mine .
the young family has its own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten was located , they hold pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens . &quot;
she tells us that it was a very frigh@@ tening situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings were destroyed during the war .
&quot; in fact , it rather has something to do with lo@@ oting . &quot;
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as it was right to them .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation comes to an end , a little boy runs past us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now tracks the ball .
&quot; as they run , some of them throw stones on the ruined buildings . &quot;
these ruins are part of their childhood that cares for in@@ genu@@ ity in their lives .
they don &apos;t know it differently .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; M@@ um Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez is a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and appears here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located at the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel near the city center .
&quot; it is led by a 59 year old Mexican woman , a small woman with a coral @-@ pink frame and golden earrings in ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
&quot; it is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , and grew up there . nevertheless , they know many of the name Mama Africa . &quot;
this nick@@ name is due to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it itself ) has become a destination for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel has no charm .
&quot; for approximately 2,@@ 50 Dollar the night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez nar@@ rates , people come in full mini@@ bus and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; m@@ um Africa ! &quot;
where are you m@@ um@@ my Africa ? . &quot;
&quot; at the moment it is rather quiet , but this year , Ram@@ í@@ rez has already received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have already slept on cardboard . &quot;
she does not want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill , they buy medicines they cannot pay , they massage them with a bal@@ m the feet exhausted from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chy Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , arrived short time ago . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; the Sebasti@@ ao family ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i , who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ ón Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez Ram@@ í@@ rez . &quot;
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; you have lived in Brazil , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he tells that Hai@@ tians and Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans already speak to W@@ hat@@ s@@ app from Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et had previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy became weaker , he started his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I wonder if he will get in touch with Ms Ram@@ í@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; &quot; we will always stay in contact . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez told her guests send her often text messages when she went to greet her or to tell her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ í@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jes@@ ú@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have taken migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar a night . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , 25 people are there , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on ceilings on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking station outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela declares that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants traveling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula come from Central America , other residents also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
José Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ én@@ dez tells me that in Honduras he fled with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to black@@ mail him money without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single trav@@ eller , offered him their roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the corri@@ dors , travellers are quietly looking for their tel@@ eph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; today , a mini@@ bus has arrived and has brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Ram@@ í@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic for those who have gone . &quot;
like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos .
&quot; there is one of her daughter with African hair spots that she has made a client , some photos of her grand@@ children and many travelers more , boy and old . &quot;
she laughs sor@@ row@@ fully while she presents her briefly .
&quot; Ya se fu@@ er@@ on , &quot; repe@@ ats them every time . &quot; they have already gone . &quot;
China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check @-@ point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang from t@@ witter @-@ users , in general , &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of U@@ rum@@ qi received a cell phone notification in which it instruc@@ ts the district government to install a surveillance app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; &quot; Web Cle@@ aning &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the message , it is said that the app &quot; prevents access to terrorist information . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the autonomous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after installing the app , exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; in the communication of the police , the app would detect and prosec@@ ute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information &quot; including videos , images , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ gs website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main function is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic websites , from online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the children &apos;s filters helps children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region .
&quot; while news about digital cens@@ orship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often glo@@ omy for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions such as X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme har@@ ass@@ ures and surveillance measures , as well as rout@@ inely internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the Twitter @-@ based media outlet &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where police inspec@@ ting the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately whether they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people .
this is a form of captivity because of the rest technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from &quot; &quot; China &quot; &quot; also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can lift the password of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer . &quot;
&quot; after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang , computers and mobile phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
the regulations in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and affiliated institutions , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office when operating their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; Freedom House &apos;s current account , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi , the authorities issued an order to register their personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards at the local police until 1 August . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos . &quot; however , this promotion viol@@ ates the personality rights of U@@ rum@@ tor@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible off@@ ence , including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .
photo by : Cor@@ rie B@@ ark@@ li@@ more ( CC B@@ Y 2.0 ) .
&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; &quot; sleep or death &quot; , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane describes his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far away from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realise that you are alone in a place where all important is gone . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually dissolved and revealed a truth , which is clearly recognizable both from the inside and from the outside . &quot;
one that makes all honor to their name .
one that has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but when the reality reco@@ vers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting , the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cries after death . &quot;
&quot; all doubt dissolve in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even when the Earth is spinning on the axis of the Un@@ hei@@ ls . you realize that you are caught here between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they have arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough to &quot; learn my lesson , &quot; as the Chief of Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn out of the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like we@@ eds .
it was enough for the town to break the darkness of the night with &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; scre@@ ams .
&quot; all quarters were cov@@ eted , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even though I did not make high demands on a city that is stu@@ ffed into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; during the third night , things had a bit cal@@ med down after listening to the electricity in the neighborhood . &quot;
I broke through the silence by scre@@ aming several times &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; from my house roof .
I heard my voice disgu@@ sted by silence .
few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , real friends joined me ; we allied ourselves to a beautiful picture , which filled my expectations fully and completely . &quot;
&quot; at such a moment you are aware that you release the spirit from the lamp , but it just doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow , nothing can give you your voice after you scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of security service from the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an stood there with several of his men , and my father was already there , as I am now . &quot;
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let me hear how you cry &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; , &quot; or you are brave enough to shout when we are not near . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes turned on me .
&quot; and thou w@@ oul@@ dest believe what to see me in the eyes , and not on the ground . &quot;
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was in my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps at the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my case when I replied : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I have never stopped looking into your eyes , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest conversation that could have such disa@@ strous consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father with them . &quot;
&quot; like his father , with that . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this cur@@ sed sentence is still in my nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot;
I went through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I wear with myself .
&quot; then back through the yard and into the second office , which leads through a corridor to the individual cells . &quot;
I conc@@ eive all the details before I enter the room .
otherwise they probably have given me a larger cell this time .
&quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and I must sit immediately without waiting for permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I resor@@ ted to an old @-@ tried communication method : hitting the wall with the fist . &quot;
I learned that my cellular com@@ rade was a &quot; first Chief . &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he answered me finally .
&quot; apparently in none of the surrounding cells was a respected middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no distinctive traits can be recognized by me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds similar to me ?
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was transferred to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
&quot; the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would release him , if I remain . &quot;
fans .
&quot; I would have liked to have had a scar@@ ec@@ row to ch@@ ase all these crow@@ s , which lab@@ elled on the fruits in the garden of my head . &quot;
&quot; from the distance , I still hear her scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be approximately 10 o &apos;clock in the evening ; always at this time the scre@@ ams , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that Black was the color of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light showing us the horror in person : the Ra@@ ad ( for example : &quot; th@@ under , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th S@@ ure of the Koran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; thus , the secret was revealed : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the al@@ a@@ wi@@ tic dialect - so they played out their con@@ fession@@ al black@@ mail and betra@@ yed the narrow viewpoint of their world view . &quot;
&quot; this is not a house , which is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to transform the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the listening room and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he will come to me . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , despite the facial expressions that der@@ ailed him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than to join this diary and protest in demonstrations , which will soon find an end . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I got used to it not to answer .
I can &apos;t really say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how that happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice told me that I had to get used to being punished , even though I had done nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
in punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much meat as possible from the body .
he calls this aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic pipe that probably comes from the kno@@ ck .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your scre@@ ams .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him and you cannot hold back your cry . &quot;
&quot; my scre@@ ams were not enough for him , so they exchanged the tube through a cable . &quot;
&quot; at my first arrest , I asked myself if the investig@@ ator used to work as a collector &apos;s collector earlier or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
&quot; they had four cables inter@@ tw@@ ined to present us the , from their point of view , great invention of a huge cable . &quot;
&quot; within a single hour three of them changed , while I was still in the row . &quot;
&quot; I lost all feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ aming . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling down and didn &apos;t take any pleasure in it , which is why he resor@@ ted to an electrically charged staff . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole district . &quot;
&quot; my half @-@ naked body , which was stretched out on the ground , was the perfect conductor . &quot;
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was there again .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
that must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
&quot; some hours passed , which occurred to me as minutes . &quot;
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens , and the morning light fills the room . &quot; R@@ aus with you , Ar@@ ma@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted young person : &quot; &quot; my Lord , my Father has to worry aw@@ fully . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and get away , you will be reloc@@ ated . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always left me free .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b talks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
&quot; Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time indoors , sometimes moving to his screen , sometimes to his computer , back and again to his couch . &quot;
but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers or his lips stained with ni@@ cot@@ ine .
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has belonged to them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they lived as fel@@ ic@@ ye@@ en ( roughly : farmers ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist who confron@@ ts the conservative majority and questioned her old @-@ proven views on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with topics such as Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . all these issues are not only relevant in his hom@@ etown of Am@@ man relevance but also in cities which range from Damascus to Syria to San@@ aa in Yemen . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special reluct@@ ance against the US @-@ American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
recorded by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have something to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian refugees of the second generation &quot; - he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances , &quot; says H@@ da@@ i@@ b . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I &apos;m a man , &quot; while in water , he sh@@ ook up Nes@@ café in two cups . it &apos;s the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; apparently , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a scor@@ ching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the swe@@ ats speak lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the squ@@ at of the K@@ ent @-@ cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when one looks at the neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - just as in the public during Ram@@ adan to drink water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , the Jord@@ ani@@ ens interior ministry cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la , already for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some parliam@@ ent@@ arians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual front singer Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country , and the main reason for the concert statement . &quot;
the de@@ pu@@ ties and former spokes@@ men of the Islamic Coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b spoke in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; just &quot; was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer .
&quot; many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the tried @-@ and @-@ tested legi@@ timacy of authorit@@ arian regimes across the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la appreciated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights &quot; who continue to use &quot; intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be simply rhet@@ oric but in fact reflect an ever more clearly emerging reality in Jordan , which appears clearly in H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b returned traditional gender men to Lei@@ be by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an unknown unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen . &quot;
it is surrounded by a red lake ; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who should trust them .
&quot; in the past years , the number of &apos; honorary orders &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still difficult to add that Jordan is missing institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way . &quot;
&quot; according to a law bann@@ ing crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can be kept in prison for an in@@ definite period , and for their release , many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing . &quot;
&quot; also H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from themes , which are long as tab@@ oos in his country . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; politics was told to me , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; and in &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political at the heart can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse often repe@@ ats often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market on which one , in his words , &quot; can get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ - or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan spoke about the rights of gay and les@@ bians , and that comments on equality between LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were still cens@@ ored by 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to remember that his comments from the context were ri@@ pped , distorted and his opinion was cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without inc@@ isions , but stre@@ amed was only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , argu@@ ing that intoler@@ ance towards homosexu@@ als is not contrary to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ da , a poet of the eighth century , who is still remembered today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ vo , who was later to work on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could openly write about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , have nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the h@@ ash@@ em@@ ite kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service seized several former government officials and members of the teacher &apos;s association , stating that they had critically responded to the problems on comments in social media , which are related to the corruption rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ b &apos;s opinion is just the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos;@@ Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - this is what H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees - is made up of slow , deliber@@ ate and internal changes . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , like millions of other Arabs , H@@ da@@ i@@ b dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of &quot; experiencing &quot; them . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , cluster muni@@ tions and arti@@ fici@@ ally provoked demo@@ cra@@ cies . at least , he hopes . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist . &quot;
this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting which A@@ man belongs to as a Student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 largest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ or dolls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta Festival .
&quot; one assumes that it is a variant of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata Festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the ar@@ mo@@ ans , drums and dancing mar@@ ched over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan mar@@ ched into the north @-@ east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the disciples , to the knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta Festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to snap a few great seats , so we got a great view . &quot;
it is difficult to imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organised a two @-@ month exhibition to W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally . &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en for a long time now : two fixed wag@@ ons are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the trip to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta Festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; # Summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ uch@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of a 18 meter high truck was incredible .
let &apos;s enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange arms against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; outside appearance and body care were rarely as important as in this history , as they help to keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and to promote a legitimate profession like the hair course . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of the capital Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are all @-@ day . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru , like many other Central and South American countries , is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous sports@@ men such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the skilled hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event , the competition of the hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been held since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; there , experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most ec@@ centric looks , as you can see in the following video ( further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) . &quot;
&quot; educational institutions such as the school August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to obtain a training in the hair@@ dres@@ ser art , which allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built up this educational community out of love with the children . &quot;
Colombia : letter of love to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

use with friendly permission .
&quot; the following article is the edited version of the contribution &quot; &quot; Love messages to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters &quot; , &quot; which published the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not much more important , people who feel em@@ itted to accommodate affection ? &quot;
&quot; this is precisely the question of the young Colom@@ bian activists Leonardo P@@ ár@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation , inspired by the campaign Cart@@ a p@@ or la Car@@ li@@ ación ( Let@@ ters to Recon@@ ci@@ liation ) , which encouraged young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; only recently , their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it : after years of negotiations the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces ) , which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian president José Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; however , before the Colom@@ bians , there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , were subjected to war rhet@@ oric and carried their weapons around the clock , must now be integrated into the lives of civilians . &quot;
&quot; the Colom@@ bian society in turn , who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred of guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , must now take these into its ranks and support them in the construction of a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians must join together and help in the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , to welcome them back to society again . &quot;
&quot; the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ illa fighter , who will then be handed over personally . &quot;
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the Let@@ ters to Recon@@ ci@@ liation was created on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ á in February 2017 . there , Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to briefly speak with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day , but forget those who need much more . &quot;
&quot; he plans to share his love with people this year , who needed most attention . &quot;
&quot; so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the F@@ ARC , who now have to find their place in society and build a new life . &quot; &quot; the letters will show that the Colom@@ bian society is ready to make discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ ín , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ á . &quot;
I would never have thought that someone would be forgiven
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the Municip@@ ality of Cal@@ i and Leonardo , travelled to the camp to bring the letters personally . &quot;
the F@@ ARC members set up as they had done before to counter the orders of their leaders .
&quot; but this time they received no orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it is incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; told the political scientist Manu@@ ela Jim@@ é@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , a member of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former warri@@ or led me through the camp of the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I saw in one of the &quot; Cam@@ bodi@@ ans &quot; ( a kind of hut in which the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters live ) , I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because next to him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ gar@@ net , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and I said , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are they doing ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone has written to me . &quot;
it is a very nice and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful , so I answer it . &quot; suddenly the tears ran over the che@@ eks . &quot;
&quot; I hu@@ gged him quite firmly , and set me beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; perhaps he was tired of the war , tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
&quot; the man told me more about his life . he had never expected anything else from life as a war . to join the F@@ ARC , was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of star@@ vation . &quot; I would never have thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes . &quot;
but now I know there is a society out there who wa@@ its for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have learned how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices
&quot; for the first time , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC have joined a discussion round . &quot;
the students were all grown up when already there was war and the F@@ ARC had already acted in secret .
&quot; therefore , the leaders of the F@@ ARC declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State worked on the whole Colom@@ bian people . &quot;
&quot; for a purpose of this magnitude , it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who have never heard their hearing and had no right to vote , and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate those who were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and so much damage , can teach us something and give us a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , the camp commander in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ í@@ o de Jes@@ ú@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the city of Cal@@ i , the following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bian was prophes@@ ied that peace would prevail after dis@@ armament .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people who are ready to take up arms , rise and protest for their rights . and this is fully justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC are now putting on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call upon all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple . those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; gay and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with hor@@ r@@ ors , activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat posed by a ladies compla@@ ining about the local LG@@ BT@@ Q community is not just over night .
OC media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic .
&quot; several months ago , the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya has captured the international head@@ lines after reports have been published that deal with the spread , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Nov@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she threw a light on the methods of Ch@@ echn@@ ya authorities who captured suspi@@ cious que@@ er men and put them into secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; they have brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ woman , was born in Gro@@ z@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt that she was a woman in reality . &quot;
&quot; as she grew up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , which is why she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after experiencing a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens from the sex equ@@ ation of their country@@ woman , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; for fear of her life , she moved to the USA in the end . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer hel@@ per in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no more men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya who can remove this confusion ? &quot;
&quot; after that , the photos of my documents made the lap through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App . &quot;
&quot; on October 10 , 2015 , I was attacked . &quot;
&quot; when I was about to pick up some shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying : &quot; here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I didn &apos;t hurt . &quot;
&quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; how long will you still honor the family , you dish@@ on@@ or ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
&quot; then I lost consciousness , and eventually woke up in the hospital . &quot;
apparently some women had everything with them and started to scre@@ am .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two stit@@ ches in my right lung wing . &quot;
OC Media : in which wings were you placed - in the men or women ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name on it ; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
&quot; when I read his name for the first time at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him that he has been respect@@ ful of me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
&quot; last February , I got threats . &quot;
&quot; they called me , wrote to me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives .
&quot; they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they ordered absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by going through the streets without going through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Gros@@ ny and say that I didn &apos;t change my gender , that everything was just bad talk , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it is still difficult for them .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
&quot; my mother became too much , and she lay down a rope around her neck . &quot;
luckily the neighbours came and saved them .
at the time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window there was a car with dark@@ ened windows and a license plate with a 95 . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , I realized that there was something rotten . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without registering for me , without proof , without anything . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number was registered on a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; you don &apos;t believe that you were safe , just because you left the country ? &quot;
our people already know in which hotel you are stuck . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is the number 115 . &quot;
can you imagine it ? !
this was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we do not talk about gender equality , this is a t@@ abo@@ o theme . &quot;
some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements I still wear in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I really care how to look at the person she reminds of her past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report last week in Washington .
&quot; for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I spoke to someone who sat in ar@@ gun for one and a half months .
&quot; he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ram@@ adan , and he did not exclude a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relative .
&quot; with this I mean , they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are there even gay men detained in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there wouldn &apos;t be so many .
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kad@@ y@@ rows &apos;s court . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can present them later as terrorists . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ould it be killed , they will show their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , they were specifically sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise . &quot;
OC Media : is this only a presum@@ ption or do you have a source for this information ?
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there was nothing new from them since then .
they just took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was himself there when these people were taken away . &quot;
&quot; until now they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there were no reports on this yet . we suspect that such actions are quite possible . &quot;
why would it not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and ab@@ duc@@ tions of people who belong to a so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite Gros@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems .
in ear@@ nest !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when the sh@@ aria was true , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia wanted to introduce us to &quot; &quot; civil@@ isation &quot; , &quot; but finally threw us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had d@@ yed eyel@@ ashes , wore tu@@ b@@ ular jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never hurt me just one hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian Theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , met a whole group of people like me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people , met there . &quot;
we were never offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : &quot; &quot; K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t think about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot;
they often say to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they believed you were sick ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they have never offen@@ ded me , never ch@@ ased , and never struck . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this grace period last ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped onto the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he started talking about morality in television . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us per se , but above all about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people started to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; whoever laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at once with suspicion . &quot;
&quot; in time , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the Republic grew steadily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you have to do now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as a activ@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; currently , I am responsible for 15 Muslim women . &quot;
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize tea meetings , meetings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards . &quot;
I don &apos;t pay a cent for that .
I discovered these people myself when I ap@@ plau@@ ded random@@ ness .
I am Muslims and want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that &apos;s sil@@ ly .
&quot; thus , nature is pure , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as Ch@@ ech@@ ens , who want to know foam before the mouth that there are no ga@@ ys at them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ ans have which , the cab@@ in@@ ers , have which , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet there is it - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live with men .
&quot; you know many think about transi@@ ents to men who love men , and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences . but that &apos;s a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling , to be exact , different life settings . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body .
not if I have a partner or not .
&quot; sorry that I become so personal here , but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago . &quot;
and I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian Ah@@ wa@@ z region suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ burning of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community in Iran , which is shaped by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ ei@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered from anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability to pay for his family , so Ah@@ wa@@ zi human rights groups who work in Ah@@ wa@@ z and want to remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments when he lighted himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was brought to the Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn &apos;t do anything any more . &quot;
he died shortly afterwards .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi Min@@ ority , and activists on site warn that more men could take life . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im - hung . &quot;
&quot; their stories have a thing in common : they were all family patriarch@@ s , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of persecution by the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi are suffering from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , where most of the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi community lives in Iran , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran , until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of that wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often the victim of untreated diseases , hunger and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ ra@@ zi @-@ Ara@@ bians in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a variety of dam@@ s , the water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories , where the provinces Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m are located . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to wor@@ sen the devast@@ ation caused by dr@@ y@@ ness in the region , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi young people now rose to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian Director General for Co@@ operatives , Labour and Social Wel@@ fare , reported that 5 % of Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who seek a job , completed primary school , completed 55 % of secondary school , and 45 % have university degrees . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... aimed at anni@@ hil@@ ating the spirit of national resistance &quot;
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , an Iranian ancest@@ ral human rights activ@@ ist , resident in London , told Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mix of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; in the number of suicide among the young Ah@@ ra@@ zi men . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is the reason for this . &quot;
&quot; since function@@ aries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , local Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their livel@@ ihood outside their native Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and so hired as even Arabic names at the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances given by the Arab Ah@@ ra@@ zi , human rights activ@@ ist alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking knowledge of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify myself with femin@@ ism , also with the inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . recorded by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . published under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ é@@ min@@ as website . the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were printed .
you can read in the comments under the original text .
&quot; when I say that I &apos;m not a feminist , many women - especially white women who call themselves inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists - are frustr@@ ated . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminine .
&quot; for example , despite equal education women still earn less money than men nowadays . &quot;
women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life , and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs . &quot;
all this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer twice and thre@@ ef@@ old . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet : when I come to speak on skin color , on racism , on black C@@ is women , on black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have been ab@@ used physically , mentally and verb@@ ally , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists choose to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; however , all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord &quot; &quot; to achieve equality ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they do not want to talk about it , in addition to sexu@@ alized violence , there is an institution@@ alized form of rac@@ ist @-@ motivated violence , which we are facing black women in two times . &quot;
or that black women and women of other ethnic and ethnic origin deserve less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background more often refer to school than white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
&quot; or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership , as white women . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women to have all men and all men of any skin color the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to take into account injusti@@ ces in her mind , which refers to both sex and skin color . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my part in a white @-@ feminist @-@ oriented sphere , which has always rejected me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner expressed in her speech : &quot; &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a de@@ human@@ ly and margin@@ alized being in historical terms . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups , which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to expe@@ dite their ego@@ centric program . &quot;
&quot; some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them of a better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and isol@@ ate themselves from white femin@@ ism , there is still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of the W@@ om@@ an@@ ism , which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman , which is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
&quot; now it is more important than ever , that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us . &quot;
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : recall ( e.g. : Africa @-@ W@@ om@@ an@@ ism : as we rec@@ ap@@ ture ourselves ) speaks of that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , mental , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists are immediately calling separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself about hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment I can raise black women and women from other cultures , because in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life is neither b@@ yp@@ assed nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine which reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published here again . &quot;
&quot; again and again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with a sur@@ f@@ board or in can@@ oe - with a special concern by the Kurdist@@ an region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations . &quot;
&quot; in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a , who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community . &quot;
&quot; I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child , &quot; &quot; says Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the Non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a summ@@ arises the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a question : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and edited for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the focus of her work lies on persecuted , little noticed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , with the help of oppressed communities to tell their stories in their own way . &quot;

&quot; the following article is the abbrevi@@ ated and edited version of the article &quot; &quot; The wave of violence against women in Paraguay &quot; . &quot; the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # wei@@ lich@@ ein@@ ef@@ rau@@ bin ) , which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police comm@@ iss@@ ar , A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez , said that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent . &quot;
&quot; since the end of their relationship , some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena because of abuse , the informed indication of A@@ da B@@ á@@ ez was not useful . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman moved back . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women do not pay any advertisement at all , they generally do not receive support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them . this also explains why only 20 % of all women admit to being victims of violence , in general report to the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; 1 Stri@@ ke and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system , which is nothing inferior to Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach , lack of implementation impacts and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to see how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ á@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ ación y E@@ studios , a social science research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the figures available are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney Office opened 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . 70 % of these were violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads in the police came from women .
&quot; there were over 5000 adver@@ ts for domestic violence in the courts of peace . here , too , 86 % of the ads of women came . &quot;
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically mi@@ stre@@ ated , 55 % of women spoke of psychological abuse . &quot;
&quot; however , these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Women &apos;s Minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually indicated . &quot; &quot; for every woman who is ref@@ unded in Paraguay for psychological abuse , 9 women who do not do this . &quot;
&quot; on any woman ref@@ unded for physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; she explained at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since women &apos;s murder in Paraguay is not a criminal off@@ ence , the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country . &quot;
the coordinator of human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies due to violence caused by men . &quot;

invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a legal system that under@@ takes nothing
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ í@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she called him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning she didn &apos;t want it , but she still gave up . this should be regre@@ t@@ table forever . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos . but for two years she bore the psychological violence , one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognis@@ able : &quot;
I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that only women are going to be sub@@ servi@@ ent because they are deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera .
&quot; nam@@ ing her name , she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their contributions , including Carlos myself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ically whether he had ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and didn &apos;t leave him earlier .
it seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complic@@ ity .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , who did not come from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay , in order to prove that her former partner ab@@ used her . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the Y@@ o te Cre@@ o network ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in any way .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others don &apos;t do : they take the testim@@ onies of women seriously .
&quot; in Victori@@ as &apos;s case , everything started with psychological abuse . &quot;
her wealthy partner eventually even managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began to beat them .
&quot; at Victori@@ as advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives , they received no support . &quot;
&quot; she led a trial against her former partner , who developed into an obsc@@ ure legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country , where it was mainly about money , power and the influence of its former partner . &quot;
Paragu@@ ays laws : good approach to poor implementation
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; the announcement of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an parliament , which was known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ ell@@ as ( # FOR ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os Movement ( # Non @-@ Ali@@ gn@@ ess ) are part of a Twitter campaign that is supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law stipul@@ ates that fem@@ ici@@ dal is to be explained and har@@ sh@@ ly punished as it is already in the neighbouring countries of Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the law text was changed in some points in order to also win the de@@ pu@@ ties for the law , which feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions is denied , which are currently prohibited in Paraguay and sentenced to five years imprisonment . &quot;
&quot; the original draft was intended to cost most of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs , which the victims of violence must bear at the present time , if they simply only pay adver@@ t and would like to receive a secure accommodation to the state . &quot;
&quot; Ak@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , abuse is seen as a part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place , so that violence is no longer regarded as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , is complic@@ it and contributes to the fact that the perpetr@@ ators will be punished . &quot;
we have to refund until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ation is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the law was passed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Senate . however , parts of the law had been altered , among other things , a passage that the partners in cases of domestic violence have called for reconciliation . &quot;
the opinions on the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law is regarded as a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media in Oman a year after bann@@ ing a newspaper continues to attack attacks
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was blocked due to a decision by the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; on the website of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the Japanese authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , continues to be in prison , where he served a one @-@ year prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , were also arrested and placed in court but later released . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power after he had dropped his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
&quot; since then , apart from his role as the only sul@@ tan , he is the only sul@@ tan , chief commander of the armed forces , Minister of Defence , Supreme Commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Foreign Affairs , Foreign Minister , Chairman of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sultan &apos;s rule is characterized by the persistent efforts of security forces , especially domestic sec@@ rec@@ y , civil liber@@ ties , including press freedom , including press freedom , independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists to in@@ timi@@ date and incar@@ n@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the authorities restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights systematically and prevent citizens , including activists from expressing their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions , both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , its closure and the imprisonment of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper which has been reported since its foundation in 2007 on corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested a article entitled &quot; High @-@ ranking parties joining the judi@@ ci@@ ary &quot; in the newspaper on 26 July 2016 . &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having pressur@@ ized judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to uph@@ old a verdict in an inheritance dispute . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was charged with the special department by the ISS and arrested at his arrival by the security forces . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS with@@ drew the deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief of You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as editor @-@ in @-@ chief after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ is arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely , after the Minister of Information had given the order that &quot; the publication and dis@@ semination of the paper is prohibited in any way , including online , starting on August 9 , 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the trial of Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i took place before the court in Mas@@ kat . &quot;
the Tribunal sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and also ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both sentenced , among others , to distur@@ b@@ ance of the public order , &quot; abuse of the Internet , &quot; and &quot; under@@ mining the prestige of the state . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was also found guilty of violation of a ban on the public and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es in the amount of 3000 om@@ bian ri@@ al ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 Ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 USD ) after making use of an information network for the dis@@ semination of material that could pose a threat to public order .
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ ani Ri@@ al ( 13@@ 000 US dollars ) was fixed and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; al @-@ Abr@@ i acqu@@ itted the Appe@@ als Court in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , however , sentenced al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for a year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after serving his six @-@ month prison sentence in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his annual prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also raised the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; despite the decision of the Court , to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper is still facing attacks by the Israeli government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed a further statement in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister asked himself another time against the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re @-@ equip the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists in the newspaper are not the only cases where Oman has recently been viol@@ ated by the freedom of the press .
&quot; further violations include , for example , the closure of the website of the independent journal M@@ ow@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operations . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the US authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive violation of the freedom of the press . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Centre for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) calls on the Israeli authorities to : &quot;
1 . You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j will release immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
&quot; 2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can follow their work ; &quot;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . under all circumstances to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists in Oman have been able to exercise their legitimate human rights work without fear of ret@@ ali@@ atory measures , including judi@@ ci@@ ary har@@ ass@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( including independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , attor@@ neys , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring countries through the promotion of freedom of expression and association and the right to gather together peac@@ efully . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , shown with his consent &quot;
medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media . it is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent .
there are two reasons for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand many medicines and vacc@@ ines are missing in the offer of the global healthcare system that cover the specific medical need on the African continent .
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have far more serious effects in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research , which is carried out by African scientists , helps build their own research capacities in Africa . a greater role of science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , just as the AIDS epide@@ mic showed the first serious impact on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post@@ doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself investig@@ ates the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Sam@@ bian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( discla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices : what is your research topic ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the main focus of my work is on the application of research results . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I have just launched a research programme for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
A@@ GA : what do you think are the important current scientific topics in your country and generally in Africa ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; that has to change , otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being a creator . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does the financing and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported in different ways .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or move here , because financing and development opportunities are better in other countries . &quot;
how is the research infrastructure ?
what are the obstacles in your routine research that you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory material is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
A@@ GA : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is already interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it focus on , and how can we support the development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special scientific training , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer sciences , big data , study of space , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and infectious diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly . &quot;
&quot; GV : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise , which pose challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines only make available for payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; Pay@@ wall &quot; ) , also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research . &quot;
&quot; from the USA to India : how &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; seed producers change global food production &quot;
&quot; this post by Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine about solutions for environmental issues around the world . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding in the United States since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ dish , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many salad sorts he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding .
&quot; the patents differ not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; over the past few years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cart@@ ons . based on this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia old tradition , Mort@@ on continues to breed let@@ tu@@ ce , but he needs longer since his work is becoming increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it &apos;s like lying in a river a b@@ oul@@ der to whom I have to p@@ addle .
&quot; so we have to do that now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before the court , no one can breed a new salad bar , because all the features are already patented . &quot;
&quot; however , he is very careful and endeav@@ ours to use no material protected as intellectual property . &quot;
it has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the USA and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; open source &quot; breeding ) .
a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salad of the Out@@ red@@ geous variety in the &quot; greenhouse &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space .

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like that the movement from the IT area would come from and not from the field of plant breeding .
open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for Open Source seed ) is inspired by the free &quot; Open Source &quot; software that provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software .
it was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , called Os@@ si , US breeders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open source &quot; breeders merely allow others who buy their seeds , cross it in order to breed their own varieties , and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the em@@ eri@@ ed professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants are both important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; according to seeds , seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to exploit the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg emphasizes that the &quot; open @-@ source &quot; movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants .
&quot; all kinds of plants could be patented , whether vegetable , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; &quot; in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; &quot; he says and particip@@ ates in the increasingly frequent fu@@ sions offered by Chem@@ China and Syn@@ gent@@ a and Mon@@ san@@ to and Bayer , which are offered in August and September 2016 . &quot;
&quot; food sovereignty without seeds sovereignty is not possible . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed initiative commit themselves to keep their seeds available free of charge . in contrast , their approach is to patent seed and plant traits . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is com@@ promised , as the available genetic pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights to plant material that is becoming increasingly limited . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . &quot;
&quot; such estimates are not yet available for other plants , but experts like Lu@@ by suggest that mass @-@ fed plants such as wheat are still patented as salads or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from those who improve their taste or colour to those , due to which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is increasing by more and more patents . however , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before , since changing conditions by climate change are much less predictable . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to spokes@@ woman C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts that intellectual property is owned by other breeders , as &quot; patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent exp@@ ires . &quot;
often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but promotes it by making more material and know @-@ how available to the public . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees it differently : 20 years to wait , until a patent exp@@ anders , certainly does not promote innovations . &quot;
&quot; if one has to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions , one would have already lost the struggle . &quot;
&quot; however , Mort@@ on &apos;s main argument is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want farmers to make their work easier . &quot;
&quot; this is what drives us forward , and it will be impossible for us if we can &apos;t continue to use the best and latest genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; in all , Mort@@ on interfer@@ es with the concept of developing plant traits : &quot; we don &apos;t really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants form themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in the US state of Oreg@@ on and Os@@ si board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; he who breeds a variety breeds his own values in them . &quot;
&quot; who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for whose cultivation mass @-@ wise her@@ bi@@ cides are needed , which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized companies ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than for example Mon@@ san@@ to ) patents possess , they create most smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the pat@@ enting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on looks for salads in his breeding garden .

&quot; in addition , Mort@@ on believes that breeders are more innovative through avoiding plant patents : &quot; it looks like I am striving to produce something new with my efforts to produce new , stronger than companies that are patented . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties myself in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be leading in the &quot; &quot; open source &quot; &quot; breeding , the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture ( &quot; Centre for Sustainable Agriculture &quot; ) , which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources , is a &quot; open @-@ source &quot; seed programme . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; open source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German organisation Agre@@ col is working on an open source license , which ultimately constitutes a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si obligation for breeders in the European Union . &quot;
( regulations for breeding differ from country to country where the Os@@ si obligation cannot be easily incorporated into one in Europe or other parts of the world . )
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the Executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . thus , it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office , which permits patents on conven@@ tionally bred plants . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not yet a law ; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference entitled &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia , on which farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives from governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the global trend for pat@@ enting seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; program for Open Source seed systems , states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems , for scheduled next year the official launch of the seed . &quot;
&quot; an association of environmental protection and development groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the International Non@@ profit Development Organisation US@@ C Canada and the Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has compiled a database about seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report published by the UN Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also emphas@@ ises the importance of a diverse , local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that more people will soon see him . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological foods has particularly been taken care of where and how something is grown , and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so , &quot; says Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human rights organisation and blog are the latest goals of the cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it was the website of a human rights organisation and the blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend around the 5th of August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the network published a statement on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains true , despite this attack and the mo@@ ck@@ ery of the Egyptian law and the constitution by the authorities who ought to defend the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world . even if it has never been so difficult to pursue these goals , it was never as important as now . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organization in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ language edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and the Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network due to alleged &quot; support of terrorism . &quot; &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of website barriers fallen victim . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ Op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; in addition to AN@@ H@@ RI , the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights scientist Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada has no access to Egypt . &quot;
Zi@@ ada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog , which he directed to b@@ ypass the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , was even the target of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider for whom also Zi@@ adas blog is given a home , on the other hand , is still accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercised bodily force against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve primarily around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him : &quot;
&quot; blocking blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and although the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; they succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege . arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ mons at the National Security Council , blocking blogs and any other web site I worked for . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proven that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , although only to a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
first I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship .
&quot; but now after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( af@@ te ) Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( af@@ te ) , Egyptian authorities blocked from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites . this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , including Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , af@@ te documented the blocking of providers , through the hu@@ gging of internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
af@@ te reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites that V@@ P@@ N@@ s offer began . &quot;
such a practice indicates the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access .
&quot; the situation is also worsen@@ ed by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed to trial against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government ready to go with the cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .

&quot; day after day , newspapers in all of Brazil report news from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old was shot in school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Thi@@ eves rau@@ ben pharmacy with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , Navy and Air @-@ Port to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the violent wave of 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; you will find at least the manager of a local newspaper .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published on August 16 , published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio , published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced a new section called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports of violence in the city are now being published there .
the paper explains the motives for their decision as follows :
&quot; extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sexual crimes , etc . everything , which devi@@ ates from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section &quot; &quot; War in Rio &quot; . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way to call : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ á@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , stated that this decision was not a reason for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ c in a country that does not recognise the war at all .
&quot; in the same video , a journalist of the newspaper states that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 8@@ 43 there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the paper continues : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , when it is distorted , can also be used to cover atro@@ cities of the police , which only shoots and then asks questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ í@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira argue against the violence as a &quot; war . &quot; &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel , education and a historical and self @-@ level@@ ing neglect of public service . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to Cec@@ í@@ lia , Rio de Janeiro is wrong : &quot; 22 of the 30 most violent cities in Brazil are according to statistics from 2015 in the north and the north @-@ east of the country . &quot;
none of these cities is in the state of Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; when we look at the Mor@@ deca@@ ys per State , Rio is in place 16 , &quot; she writes . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Glob@@ o , the largest media company in South America , which , as Cec@@ í@@ lia stresses , has been repeating the state &apos;s security policy for years . &quot;
&quot; these security policy measures also included the establishment of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ í@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003 , whose aim is to conquer a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police patch and permanently station@@ ing a unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths . however , after several reports on sh@@ kan@@ es and repres@@ sions against the poor communities , which was supposed to protect the newly created police unit , the U@@ PP was increasingly bombar@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ ão Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux published one of his articles in 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio would not comply with the criteria designated for the term &quot; civil war . &quot; &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and paths that are typical of a war . this includes entering into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; where a civilian is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost spheres . &quot; &quot;
the fact is that the inhabitants of the fav@@ el@@ as in Rio continue to suffer .
a week ago it is now time for the police to take up the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; amid all this violence , this incident also made head@@ lines : a fruit sal@@ es@@ man died as a result of shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

source : Can@@ Do@@ Action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer from brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime towards loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and around the country , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; particularly strong is the East Gh@@ out@@ a region , where chemical weapons attack on August 21 , 2013 called for hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume , based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations , that the massacre was perpet@@ rated by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels have been subjected to controlled areas outside Damascus , which led to the need for residents to be locally produced or smu@@ g@@ gled by tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the many years of block@@ ade , traditional food such as meat has become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , as they can plant their own fung@@ i as &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
&quot; mushrooms are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria , and are only rarely part of the Syrian cuisine . however , their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the Direc@@ tly of the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we chose fung@@ i cultivation because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices , who has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is gaining more and more promin@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; in order to collect money for the initiative , we use the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ do in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to give 125 families knowledge to the planting of mushrooms , such as Dr. Lei@@ la to Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached more than 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 Euro , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ do until Monday , September 4th 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la said Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; production of mushrooms from the regions &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption .
&quot; after that , they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub . as this succeeded , they used a larger bath . and so on . &quot;
now they have designed a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months , they have spread mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a for free . &quot;
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach people mushroom breeding for various reasons &quot; &quot; : break of the siege . &quot;
provision of a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency by using food lef@@ to@@ vers ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc . ) for the production of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women who work at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities connected to their home .
he said : &quot; we hope to spread this idea throughout the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege becomes visible .
we want our experience to be inspired in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017
&quot; on October 21 , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal . &quot;
forty @-@ two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of forest fires from 15 to 16 October . this led to the last week of solidarity with the victims of the victims for 3 days .
fires were also registered in the Gali@@ cia region in Spain where there were 4 dead .
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks , which spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy occurred in Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest surveillance system , which monitors the forest areas via satellite ima@@ gery , around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in four districts .

numerous videos spread on the net and show pictures that allow better insights into what happened :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the aim of the protests from Saturday was the demand for better prevention and prevention measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the extent of the tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ ão Sover@@ al from the Con@@ federation of Far@@ mers of Portugal declared P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o &apos;s paper :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ ó@@ g@@ ão , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads that were surrounded by fire .
&quot; in the forest of Lei@@ ria , a similar tragedy would have happened as in June , as the roads were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , building permits in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal for the forestry form , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed construction activity from case to case if the applicant had funds for self @-@ protection - that was an open backdoor , so that everything could be built , &quot; Jo@@ ão Sor@@ val res@@ ig@@ ns in the same article of the P@@ ú@@ b@@ lic@@ o newspaper . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of readily combus@@ tible wood , as in a vi@@ cious circle , spread further and further , as in a vi@@ cious circle . &quot;
&quot; these issues include the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October , as citizens seeking information or trying to contact relatives , offline . &quot;
it was a private initiative that provided the population with information : they used their own civil protection data through the application fo@@ ils and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires .
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ ão P@@ ina to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and was so crucial that the servers didn &apos;t stand up to the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted more than half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

&quot; in a night in the autumn of 1994 , the Taliban &apos;s conquest of Afghanistan began . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n group@@ ings , which had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus , Afghanistan had become a land of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy , belongs to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in Central Afghanistan , for the last time together with his family at dinner . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother did not say it at that time , she knew that she would no longer see her son any more - maybe even never . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy was supposed to break up . &quot;
his un@@ cle would fetch him and bring him to the tu@@ gs .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara suddenly felt un@@ protected . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , well @-@ known for their hatred , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af was found in Pakistan . &quot;
for a few years he worked in a coal mine . the work was heavy and made him sick .
once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged sacks with mortar which were heavier than he himself to earn his livel@@ ihood .
&quot; back then , like today , Afghan refugees in Iran have been characterised by poverty and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really tough , &quot; A@@ shar@@ af remembered in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the construction site , on which we also worked . &quot;
there were no services there and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we didn &apos;t freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and prepared for the trip to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing over the sea he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited island of Greece . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , ran alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to needy . &quot;
&quot; it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seekers due to relatively high payment rates . however , it is also true that the conditions governing asylum seekers in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe &apos;s human rights organisation writes the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special reception centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ prepared personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to Italian law , asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which may withdraw for months after the registration of the application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so it was also A@@ shar@@ af .
but his unt@@ amed li@@ fest@@ yles helped A@@ shar@@ af to get rid of these conditions soon .
&quot; after several years of working in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af set his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a bite stop .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis &apos;s success story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) by director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film received the Venice City Award in 2017 , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; lots of bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , some 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on its way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of Afgh@@ ans were created , including tail@@ ors , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice , Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek courts . &quot;
Afghan business@@ man Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened in Pad@@ ua the restaurant Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a S@@ ush@@ i restaurant in Rome are also Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where a risk is , there are also possibilities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily when I know my people suffer .
&quot; I plan a project for peasants from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as all others . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also for@@ ges plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; this allows them to sell their harvest surplus in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there is stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey herself . now , he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this path . &quot;
&quot; citizen Report : Egypt &apos;s draft laws enable the shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , for more than 900 days in prison . &quot;
&quot; he reported about the clearing of the camp Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the overthrow of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

&quot; global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ ac@@ ey &apos;s Ne@@ tional Report is an international snapshot , showing challenges , victories and emerging trends in global Internet rights &quot;
the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
&quot; in order to be able to use social networks , users must register within six months of un@@ successful law enforcement on the authority &apos;s website , stating their full name as well as their ID number . &quot;
those who miss this step could be sentenced to a sentence of up to six months or imprisonment of a pen@@ al payment .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty members of Parliament , is currently in charge of the legislative and the constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another MP filed a legislative proposal in which harder sanctions would be introduced to insul@@ t the President or a senior civil servant . &quot;
&quot; under the law proposition , such a fact would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , as legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law is passed , this may mean up to three years imprisonment for the convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would support a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who was arrested on 13 August 2013 when he took photos of violence against demonstr@@ ators , who demonstrated against the military coup that led to the resolution of elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan , like more than 700 protest participants , who had been arrested in the same incident four years in prison for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his hearing was postpon@@ ed until May 20 , because the prison management , according to human rights groups , failed to bring the defend@@ ant from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan is threatened by the death penalty due to one so many human rights groups agree that floo@@ ding of among others weapons of possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal tribunal in G@@ iza free the two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were charged for their coverage of pro @-@ Mor@@ si seat block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the sentences of journalists Abdul@@ lah al @-@ Fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the preceding case , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
Tunisi@@ an activ@@ ist li@@ stens to le@@ aked documents
&quot; in May , Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia was mainly interro@@ gated by the President of the Republic , which , according to the plan , endor@@ sed a controversial draft bill that would guarantee business@@ men and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused officers of am@@ nesty provided they return all un@@ lawful mon@@ ies . &quot;
&quot; the document published on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at on April 21 , sheds light on how the preten@@ tious plans for the support of the legislation will look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia rejected the name of his sources , stating article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an press code , which ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared as a witness in the District Court in Tunis on 9 May . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to submit their identity ?
&quot; according to new rules of the Information Bureau of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China require permission before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
in the rules it is also stated that registration with the full real name will be required .
analysts suspect that the elimination of anonymous comments should be achieved in conversations within the social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these regulations .
Chinese citizens have proposed in the social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and its independence .
will we then see you in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia blocked access to the latest Chinese Mess@@ aging app We@@ Chat . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat delayed the registration of the state government as an &quot; organis@@ er of information distribution . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a law from 2014 , thanks to which the Russian government provides a list of online services that organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to be responsible for the removal of content and to force it upon request to susp@@ end user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites are currently websites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ plac@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court features blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered the blocking Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia ad@@ mins refused to delete two English @-@ language articles , the data , Turkey support the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication provided that the site was blocked because it became &quot; an information source , which co@@ operates with groups in order to insti@@ gate a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time that Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is thus , in addition to China , one of the few countries around the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain cannot stop s@@ cul@@ ling
&quot; following this week &apos;s documents , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and intelligence services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation continues until 19 May . reactions and proposals by members of the public can be forwarded to the Ministry of the Interior . &quot;
