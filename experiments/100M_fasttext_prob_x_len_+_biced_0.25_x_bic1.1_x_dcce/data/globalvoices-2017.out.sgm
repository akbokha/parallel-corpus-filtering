<seg id="1">"although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation, I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound impact on me that I became a journalist mainly because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old, I saw the magnificent Denzel Washington, how he played Gray Grantham in The Pelican letter, a fearless reporter who covered the murderous plot of an oil magnate with the help of Julia Roberts, who wanted to occupy the top federal court with judges who were inclined to occupy his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was, as if that is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I lived in Arizona, my admiration for the US had only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said," America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it's easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I had even written a very blackish love letter about its size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me as he deals with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">In his opinion he never stops behind the mountain as you say so beautifully.</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it, and publicly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, Afro-Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted for him in droves."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number that a candidate nominated by the Party has ever reached."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigoted person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I had met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, director of the journalism programme, which takes people from all over the world, a deep believing human being, with whom I could talk about Islam and its past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in his view, Trumps did not agree with the view of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met in our joint love for basketball and we spent a lot of hours watching the "Phoenix Suns" at the game.</seg>
<seg id="25">"she is also in stark contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fights the environment for her life, and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">"she still fits to Kristi Kappes's commitment, which always helped me to get used to the complexity of American life with much patience and grace."</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew treats, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise advice helped me a lot in my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump bahed his way to the nominated Republican presidential candidate, they gave me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">"it turned out, however, that they were the exception of the rule."</seg>
<seg id="31">"on November 8, 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, presided over a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt towards non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump, because they either shared his racism and fanaticism or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to call the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and respectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in a different way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that those voters, most of whom are white, voted for Trump, because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, perhaps they wanted to say that they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who comments on the cruel decision to raise a man who looks down with contempt on those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(note D. Ü): as much as" rebellion of the whites against all other ethnicities, "white in allusion to the whites and whiplash, as the great Van Jones described, exactly what America did so great."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever faith or background you may have, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country elected as its president twice the son of a Kenyan, whose history, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"however, with the election of Donald Trump, there is a huge part of the white America's promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11, the white man is back at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a demonstration for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, would my son, captain Humayun Kahn, have a place in your America?" "asked Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd answered with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"do Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "the crowd roared."</seg>
<seg id="52">"do Latinos have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Do Afro Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"" "no!" "they cried and their voices became louder."</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and voiced "NO!"</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" "thank God, Mr. Trump, isn't that your America." "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the country, for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"that is now Trump Land, said the news."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people that look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>
<seg id="62">And that breaks my heart.</seg>

<seg id="69">What did the Mexican music school of Vicente Guerrero Community have in the province of Oaxaca together with the children of the Paraguaan city of Cateura?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music, which is played at both places, has not only changed the life of the children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the trash</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill site, only 16 km south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial town, very popular among tourists, but worlds away from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for several years now, La banda de Música (music band) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra composed of children and adults, which has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty with their musical instruments."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The British newspaper The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for their drug abuse and gangs."</seg>
<seg id="77">"but this changed after a random encounter with a French pilot, who started a musical project and offered a rare hope of hope for the youth."</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NIV:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"they always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the hustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, allhorn, timpani, bongos and the conga."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Waste</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero are the children of Cateura - a village that is located on the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguays's capital - on instruments produced from recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with remanufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chavez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double basses, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and percussion, all produced from waste."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, paraguayan and Latin American music as well as music of the Beatles, Frank Sinatra, etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article in the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chavez, a local ecologist and educator of the children of Cateura, recalls the beginning:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult, because we had no place for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in trash. children knew no music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them do not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed when Favio was shown something he never saw before: a violin made from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is a whole orchestra, which plays instruments of remanufactured material and which is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentary called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) shows the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">"every year, the world generates about one billion tons of rubbish."</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest - like people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Fill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring play of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>
<seg id="95">The orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis:</seg>
<seg id="96">These East African countries demonstrate how technology and team work can effectively combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that combats wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine that specifically reports about international, practical solutions for environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="99">The republication occurs as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia, before it looked for Africa's other coast."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly raised and little inclined to welcome a criminal law of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the Comes, Mozambique and the Seychelles quickly mobilized against the ship."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly the prime minister was surrounded by countries who just refused everything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior clerk of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and followed the ship at his time."</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then expelled from the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"ultimately, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars in Liberia, due to plundering the country's fish stocks."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which crosses criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 was founded by NRO Stop Illegal Fishing (Illegal Fisheries)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network are the six countries which had then expelled the prime minister from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" "with this we have eight countries, who are like-minded and work together. they exchange information and stand on each other when it comes to illegal fishing", "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable Trusts Project Ending Illegal Fishing. FISH-i provides technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is unregulated by definition: what is captured is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing in regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"by the deliberate disregard of existing laws, through which certain habitats and species are to be protected, the illegal fishing can harm ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"but while campaigns against illegal fishing had once been hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and also by the snail stamp, which circulated information between individual countries, the actions are now done in real time, with traceable to FISH-i's digital communication platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"there the individual countries can exchange lists of existing licenses, for example, news on suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also pursues the activities of ships very attentive when they move on the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this allows the authorities to mark ships that fish in forbidden areas. also, such suspicious cycle routes can be discovered - such as those indicating that a ship will load its caught fish on the move to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations show whether the participating vessels have a fishing license where they were travelling and possibly also whether they have a criminal code."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can then refuse to accept such vessels in their ports on the basis of this information. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it is about significant financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worthwhile."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm engaged in the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the already mentioned platform was created to regain estimated 20 million USD of lost turnover, which will lose the eight members of the HISH-i network each year due to the illegal fishers who invade East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries in which the region attracts commercial fishing from all over the world.</seg>
<seg id="122">"their practices include campaigns such as sailing under false flag, bogus licence papers, fantasy names, fishes of protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately exploit the lack of international co-operation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbroken control system," "says Long." "earlier a ship could fish illegally and a country could then say 'You dared not start my port.'"</seg>
<seg id="124">"but another country could say 'Come to me'." "and exactly this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i now."</seg>
<seg id="125">"until now, the closed front works."</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspected ships."</seg>
<seg id="127">It has uncovered criminal networks that had spread bogus licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities and it has followed and found escaping ships.</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to combat crime, FISH-i can share and receive information on illegal fishing over long distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime, "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">He builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious vessels more precisely.</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, also helps to track down the illegal ships that would like to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" the illegal fishers use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and their position, "" says Duncan Copeland, chief analyst at Trygg Mat tracking, an NGO that also deals with fisheries data and provides FISH-i technical support. "</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships switch off their automatic identification systems, for example, so they can no longer be ordered by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that combines different levels of information. FISH-i should help to find criminal-acting ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">A model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But FISH-i's team can actually influence the unquestionably global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NRO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana marine conservation organization: a platform that offers satellite data and by means of which the position of each traceable ship can be displayed worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "together with the neighbors to get a better picture of who is doing what, it simply makes sense," "he says." "here is a chance for countries to unite and to bundle their resources for investigation."</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global scale." "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project in which a global system allows the persecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">There are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect criminals but also deter them.</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships that had been fished without a license and had little consequences for them now know that they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries involved at FISH show a 33% increase in fishing turnover, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose use was prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"" "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become a study object." "in West Africa several hundred million dollars disappear every year through illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there have been six countries joined together in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they also combat illegal fishing, according to the same model as FISH-i." "security is the goal of creating even more such initiatives and structures in other regions," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's most recent country was able to announce its first major triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship that was traveling under false flag. and not only was the ship travelling without a license and used towing nets that are now banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also invaded in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "by taking measures against Greko 1, they set a strong sign that they would go against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i, this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special collaborative way of working to protect the oceans actually works across the world. Emma Bryce is a freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="163">"in the context of the social, political and economic crisis in which the inflation and violence rate are among the highest in the world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% at the end of the year) and in which a serious and far-reaching lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum in favour of many as the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>

<seg id="202">Luis Alberto Quijano did not choose his life.</seg>
<seg id="203">"beginning with the burden of carrying the same name as his father to the brutal military operations in La Perla prison, which he observed at the age of 15, he suffered enough."</seg>
<seg id="204">For 34 years he kept his family secret.</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide spread of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"to translate, you need two important skills: passive language skills in order to understand the starting text and to transfer active language skills in order to transfer it to the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active control of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. generally, the conviction that translators should be in the target language - should not be in the original language - native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ English as their mother tongue to translate the translations into English. this may be due to lack of understanding of translating, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have foreign employees, can nevertheless produce translations within the company. then the Japanese employee, whose English knowledge is considered the best, is made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills are really."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Machine translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the rinsing and enigmatic sentences, created by mechanical translations, show that this technique can't replace any human translator for a long time. this applies especially to some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the mysterious imprints that often decorate shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or even understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">Translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewelry. but by large companies or by the government that have the means to guarantee higher standards you can expect more careful translations.</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully use a more serious source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="500">"Pixabay image, modified by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian MPs recently voted on a bill to "regulate the regulation on use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if it is accepted by Parliament, users and users of social media in Egypt must register at a governmental authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up, which is mandated to give citizens a permit to use social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months with the adoption of the law, users must register on the site of the site with their proper names and ID number to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if it fails to do so, it could bring a penalty of up to six months of imprisonment or fines."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill, which consists of six paragraphs and circulates in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as any application that runs over the Internet and is used to communicate with others through voice, video messages and text."</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is not clear how the law is enforced when it is adopted, since the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities should impose the registration on users who do not register in view of the fact that the Egyptian government is currently unable to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Member of Parliament and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the telecommunications ministry to get through the firewall blocked by Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level all around Facebook. due to them, it would be necessary for Egyptians and Egyptians to submit information about their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" Senior Research Scientist ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, on German" Egyptian initiative for personal rights "), commented Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacities and the understanding of any authority in Egypt concerning things that have to be done with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they have forcibly control physical public and private spaces, it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, it means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a crazy system to monitor people's activities and to bring them to a trial."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is technically not realistic - but everything is possible in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed at the legislative of the Parliament and the constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its acceptance and enforcement be successful or not, the draft is in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in whose sense the control will be maximized and ensured that no diverging narration is present on the screen," says Raoof. "</seg>

<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal rights activists Hana Ahmed Raza and their team of scientists from the non-governmental organization Nature Iraq are working to protect the spirits of the Persian leopards."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger family of leopards, who fight through Africa and Asia belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether, there are between 800 and 1000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to poaching, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and as they find less and less loot."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular type of leopards so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," the Persian Leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem also depends on the fact that a big predator is present."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard in fact is small and goes against zero. as the team in the video shows that they have a recording of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out pure joy."</seg>
<seg id="530">"as a biologist, Raza passionately likes to show a different side of her country, which is not only of war and conflict."</seg>

<seg id="544">"at the beginning of March 2017, Kahoku Shimpo, the daily newspaper Kahoku Shimpo, documented the progress made in the last six years to rebuild the lives of those who were affected by the" triple disaster "of March 2011. a massive earthquake, tsunami and an atom accident in Fukushima caused the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi prefecture. Miyagi Prefecture was a state prefecture in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighboring states Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate because the tsunami had abandoned entire coastal towns from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"the prefecture of Fukushima was still experiencing a nuclear accident, already alone, 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes alone."</seg>
<seg id="548">"the special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows from the local point of view, which progress has been reached six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority as well as survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"Kahoku Shimpo-Zeitung reports that up to December 2015, a total of 77 per cent of the planned replacement houses (which have been completed) were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was able to see the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 per cent of the planned replacement houses were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 per cent of such houses, whereas Fukushima forms the final light with 70 percent."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, still, six years after the catastrophe, the evacuation of temporary shelters (that is to be evacuated to Kasetsu juutaku) remains to be relocated to final replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, nearly 80,000 people were forced to live in homes."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, 36,000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such dwellings."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the evacuations from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, while Miyagi was more successful."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the figure is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper could determine, 1074 of 1,100 schools, which were affected by misfortune, opened their doors by December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it states that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is far more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while nearly 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 percent of fishing harbours have resumed their operations in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of agrarian land, moved extensively."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi recovered 93 percent of its agricultural land, with only 66 percent of the agricultural land in Iwate and less than 50 percent destroyed farmland in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is only a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of destroyed land of Fukushima are located in the nuclear barrier zone."</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but also here Fukushima remains far off."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist numbers in Miyagi and Iwate are again to 90 percent on the same level as before the disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can show only 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal dwellers, it is more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the native population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine the overall picture, the newspaper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the survivors."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in its introduction to the article, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey in order to learn more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">"the survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents, measures have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis."</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of catastrophes prevention has been done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it is about those who had to evacuated from the Fukushima prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in its edition to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has also focused its attention on the situation of the evacuation from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to experience not only the tremendous earthquake and the devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima prefecture was also a witness to the worst, catastrophic, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"from 160 000 evacuations from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were transferred to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016, a little more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, had been resettled into permanent replacement houses."</seg>
<seg id="580">"according to the 2017 stand, 40,000 residents of Fukushima are living outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas, most of the evacuated ones are older than 50 years old. it is well known that the efforts for the reconstruction of Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima need to compete with massive construction projects."</seg>

<seg id="643">"the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically obsolete, and hardly competitive they became unbearable for the country."</seg>

<seg id="692">"young people from the First Nations communities across Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do it using hip-hop, thanks to a series of hiking workshops."</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour, workshop leaders have been bringing mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by the educator David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop Group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop ends with the fact that the young participants in talks are topics such as" cultural identity, language, confrontation, love, self acceptance, "or whatever comes to mind."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribal area of the Kitsumkalum First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called Highway of tears, a road section in Westkanada, where almost two dozen of mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">The cases were mostly not elucidated.</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation is.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always know the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song that the Whapmagoostui Cree First nation recorded, the chorus is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the youths involved here received some help from Gary Jolly from the North-star hip-hop group, who gave them a stopper in the Eastern James Bay Cree."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the facebooksside of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript, as well a translation into English which is translated into German:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like nobody is ever interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to continue my days on earth</seg>

<seg id="708">Because as youth we lost our way in life</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will raise one day</seg>

<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, close to the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (" "plastic models of the courts" ") of any dish served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they are entering or continuing the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a lot of these small companies that produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they don't even notice them anymore. however, a new trend is turning them into showy mobile phone accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">Naver Matome published the blogger itinii series of social media links and photos showing this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="728">The new boom of essences is becoming increasingly more complex.</seg>
<seg id="729">"in this case, an imperial-don (a popular rice dish with seafood) was transformed into a mobile support."</seg>
<seg id="730">"for this triangular bowl (lol), we found a good use as a mobile support."</seg>
<seg id="731">We also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo railway station.</seg>
<seg id="732">And here is an apple that holds your mobile phone:</seg>
<seg id="733">"designed to look like an apple, with a notch for the mobile phone, this is already a great design."</seg>
<seg id="734">And this is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the comic.</seg>
<seg id="735">"some mobile desktops and mobile phone designers allow you to produce your own artwork. in this case, ikura or salmon-cheating is used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports in domestic and foreign media about the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the blenders and killed regularly only appear in statistics. however, these do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that this struggle entails."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drug bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the chief of the Sinaloa cartel, completely pressed the stories of the victims of the conflict in the background."</seg>
<seg id="751">"on the day after a violent incident, hardly anyone looks at the grieving or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind every body, behind every bone discovery, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners, whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"for this reason, the Mexican news portal Animal Político created the digital project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco "(German:" living with drug trafficking ") to give these victims a voice and tells stories of people who are rubbed into the struggle between the law enforcement agencies and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project as follows:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime can not only be feared by our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and whole communities have to drive many kilometres to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches for his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who lost her father only one day, her four sisters, her husband and two of her nephews."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priests:" "as every Sunday we prepare ourselves again today for the task which we have set ourselves to go and look for tombs, according to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is called Antonio Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric business in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">"on October 13, he left the house."</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th he should be back again, but he never came again." Emma Veleta said: "it's very difficult for me, because I am now alone with three children who need education."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are the insurance of my father, but it does not pay them out because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that? "</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, the fragility and the state leadership."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the state of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have been familiar with disease and sensation journalism for some years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"every day I come to newspaper kiosks and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I cannot be indifferent or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She continues to write:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he wants to become Narco (German: drug traffickers) when he is big. and it's not normal that people hear songs about the" heroic deeds "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">For me this is as if they ridicule those who have lost someone and those who are afraid that something happened to them.</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness when stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"the senselessness of men is incredible for me, when the death of six people and the enforced disappearances of 43 students in a neighboring town are justified by the fact that they were" "rebellious". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to convince themselves that they are spared from such tragedies, if they are not stirring and still."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months of blackmail in the capital district: "as a family with threats has been plundered." in this, it describes how armed criminals pressed money from their business for month until they end up destroying not only the business, but also their family apart. "</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how many people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain never passes, the trauma stays, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want the others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"in these awful days I asked if wines would dissolve my deepest feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I have to learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">Journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega published the article "The Forgotten Kids of Ciudad Juárez: a Generation of Forgotten Generation."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing woman and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of Mexico's most dangerous city?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cooking potatoes, making tortillas warm and" chchi "for the babies who live with him. this is his name for preparing the vial with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - inexpressible for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and he had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years earlier, when he was just a few blocks away from his home, seeing the bloody corpse of his father who was shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">"born in Bryan, the situation in Juárez looked like this:"</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 as violence by organised crime and the fight against it mixed with the already existing social problems in Juárez.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010 Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Ombudsman for Public Security and Government of the Government of the United States."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the public prosecutor had 3103 killings. this corresponds to 8.5 killings a day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few of hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and invade the country's soul.</seg>
<seg id="814">"only a few stories continue to live in the face of new headlines, but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco, "Animal Político 2015 launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to portray the complex information behind the failed struggle against drug trafficking that has tormented the country over the past four decades."</seg>

<seg id="819">"but how is the years after something has appeared for the first time? content in social media, whether true or untrue, tends to persist."</seg>
<seg id="820">Let's take this photo of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo).</seg>
<seg id="821">"since its first release, it has been used irreversible to portray tragedies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="822">"this false coupling of picture and event -" incorrect description "or" false context "in the terminology of Global Voices or First Draft News - does not deny the fact that there is ample careful reporting of events in the DR Congo, Myanmar and Nigeria."</seg>
<seg id="823">But it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news.</seg>
<seg id="824">What happened in the Democratic Republic of the Congo</seg>
<seg id="825">"in 2010, a tank car crossed the place Sange in the east of the DR Congo, tilted and exploded. 230 people died."</seg>
<seg id="826">"after the civil war, Africa's second largest country had been neglected for years and thus devastated. the roads in the region became dangerous paths full of battles that were difficult to navigate."</seg>
<seg id="827">"tragically, one fell victim to that of the tanker lorries."</seg>
<seg id="828">"officials described a fireball that enveloped dozens of houses including a movie theater near, which was full of people looking at the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="829">Houses scattered and charred corpses were scattered in the streets.</seg>
<seg id="830">Many people were burned for lack of recognition.</seg>
<seg id="831">"a picture entitled" This is Nigeria. "from Imgur user Mystical Monkey, January 12, 2015.Several photos of the incident form the horrible scenes of this day."</seg>
<seg id="832">Above is an example of this.</seg>
<seg id="833">It shows rows of stuffed bodies that are strung on the floor while people watch them.</seg>
<seg id="834">But here the story does not end.</seg>
<seg id="835">"over the years the same photo was taken up several times on social media, blogs and other platforms and wrongly attributed to real but not related tragedies, in particular events in Nigeria and Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="836">What did not happen in Nigeria and Myanmar</seg>
<seg id="837">"on 3 January 2015, combatants of Boko Haram attacked the remote villages of Baga and Doro Gowon."</seg>
<seg id="838">Eyewitnesses reported dramatically of atrocities they had to flee.</seg>
<seg id="839">Houses and shops were burnt down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes.</seg>
<seg id="840">"there were reports, according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massacred."</seg>
<seg id="841">"but the figures could not be confirmed." "no one stayed behind to count corpses," "said a resident to Human Rights Watch."</seg>
<seg id="842">"many had been dismembered, shot or burned."</seg>
<seg id="843">Only on the basis of satellite images the follow-up time could be illustrated.</seg>
<seg id="844">"the reason for the attack was also unsolved, but the army base in Baga was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the Boko Haram's attempt to win the country (examples from 2013 and 2015)."</seg>
<seg id="845">And here the picture from the DR Congo appeared again when it was falsely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack:</seg>
<seg id="846">That is Nigeria.</seg>
<seg id="847">"a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris."</seg>
<seg id="848">They are not Charlie.</seg>
<seg id="849">They are dead.</seg>
<seg id="850">"in fact, this abusive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abortions; Africa Check has documented assignments on Nigeria since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="851">"in all these cases, the picture was presented as proof of mass killings."</seg>
<seg id="852">"one more step further, personal comments such as this example falsely falsify the image from the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to provide arguments."</seg>
<seg id="853">The image of Sange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Rohingya in Myanmar.</seg>
<seg id="854">"according to a warning message, published by the United Nations, those who were able to flee could strike blows, rape and several dead, some by burning."</seg>
<seg id="855">"while others reported about the violence against the Rohingya, Posts appeared like the following, who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo:"</seg>
<seg id="856">"this picture comes from an Saudi Arabian news page, falsely claiming that the President's Thein Sein have said that monks and politicians had participated in the murder of Rohingya Muslims. in addition, she had used the image from the DR Congo to see this information."</seg>

<seg id="928">There are two strong topics or frames (framing) that pass through these posts. the first frame focuses on religion.</seg>
<seg id="929">The photo was used with regard to larger discussions about silence in connection with the killings of Christians by Muslims or - for the defence of Muslims - the mordings of Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>
<seg id="930">A second framing uses the image to discuss how an African life is underrated in comparison to a European or French life.</seg>

<seg id="933">"with social media, there are umpteen people who inadvertently share the water around a tragedy."</seg>
<seg id="934">"suggests this mood of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and adorn the real horror of what has actually happened in the DR Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The dissemination of violent images has already been extensively debated (here for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that holding images of a refusal is equivalent to acknowledging the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even demanded by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, concern is that violent images will desensitise readers and viewers, and take the ability to feel empathy (for example, this study, which investigates how violent media work to help others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent portrayals in the news media, it is a fact that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists are experimenting with algorithms to support the fight against" "fake news". "you will need to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, which can actually be removed from context or in a completely abusive way."</seg>

<seg id="974">"rain falls on Saturday (27 May), and the water levels in some areas slowly returned."</seg>
<seg id="975">Health and hygiene conditions of the population represent a massive challenge in the affected areas and still inaccessible areas.</seg>

<seg id="982">Various organizations and start-ups are also ready to help.</seg>

<seg id="1001">"my friend looks at me and says," "These things do not concern you, aren't you?" "why, because I am not Muslims?" "I ask."</seg>
<seg id="1002">I have already managed this conversation.</seg>

<seg id="1004">They kidnapped me.</seg>
<seg id="1005">There are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide.</seg>
<seg id="1006">We do not all look the same.</seg>
<seg id="1007">We practice our religion differently.</seg>
<seg id="1008">"we identify with it to be a Muslim, in different ways. but somehow we are all inserted into the same Muslim drawer."</seg>
<seg id="1009">"this drawer is so well constructed in our collective conception that as soon as Muslims, which as I do not fit in, have to be abused."</seg>
<seg id="1010">Stabilization of the muscles</seg>
<seg id="1011">I don't stand alone with it.</seg>

<seg id="1017">"Islam, the Koran and Prophet Muhammad were up to the day when he died, the center of his poetry."</seg>
<seg id="1018">"but in the western conception, the religion of Rumis was removed, as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry."</seg>
<seg id="1019">This deleting makes a large part of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world.</seg>
<seg id="1020">Another is the reductionist images of Muslims who have been colonizing Western books for centuries.</seg>
<seg id="1021">This tempting image language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save.</seg>

<seg id="1027">"this narrative fails to recognize that when French, Muslim women are prevented from wearing their headscarf in public buildings and forcing Saudi Arabian, Muslim women through their government to cover their entire body that these are both two sides of the same coin."</seg>
<seg id="1028">A powerful group exerts his "control" to the "other."</seg>
<seg id="1029">This strong narrative weakens Muslim women who conduct movements for change.</seg>

<seg id="1031">It deletes the existence of queer Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="1032">This narrative has filled our collective imagination so deeply and erroneously that often Sikh-men and children become the target of anti-Muslim attacks and harassment.</seg>

<seg id="1139">"here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written word but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and appreciate the language diversity of large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, urban areas such as Melbourne and Darwin are in Australia or Oakland in the United States where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not so small languages are not passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that embrace diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while" listening frequently is often associated with understanding, "these events instead" listen "instead" listening, "in order to appreciate, to touch."</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, storytellers publish their story in their own language first and translate or explain it in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not a professional story teller, their devotion and their representation lead to the audience being involved."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso, which is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate takes the opportunity to explain the customs of narrative art that are typical for their country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamara tells the tale of the rabbit and the baboon in the language Shona of Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the meaning of his fabel, John Nyamara asks:" how is that to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a wide grin he shares his sense of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You have listened to!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were all with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organizers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own story stories."</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for re-establishment of sovereign debt from the US</seg>
<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which amounted to 72 million US dollars, various religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017. the march started at the Vatican Capitol, the government building of the capital, and proceeded to the Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juans."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the group "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizens Front for the Neurons of Debt) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of reestablishing the debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people of Puerto Ricos demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for debt are to be held accountable for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial audit and an Steering Committee without personal interest in public debt, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding remuneration that acts in favor of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are blackmailed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people of Puerto Ricos refuse to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our pensioners will not be able to reconcile with falling pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">The island - not the sovereign territory of the United States - is suffering from a severe financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"therefore, the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "an independent non-profit organisation without party affiliation, proposes a law on the socio-economic development, a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervisory authority."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ricos requires a wide restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"without the participation and conviction of the citizens, measures imposed on the outside will be at risk of being rejected by the people."</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration called the name "Night watch for light and truth."</seg>

<seg id="1183">But he is not forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="1184">"more than five years after being arrested by the Syrian regime, his supporters and relatives continue to campaign for his freedom and remember the contributions he has done for an open network."</seg>
<seg id="1185">"at this year's re: Publica, the annual digital culture conference held in Berlin, dedicated itself to an event of the # FreeBassel campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1186">"Mélanie Dulong de Rosnay, a scientist of the CNRS Institute for Communication Sciences, and Barbara Rühling, managing director of Book Sprints, a publisher of the book Cost of Freedom: a Collective Inquiry (The Cost of Freedom: a Collective Refleiry)."</seg>
<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is freely available here, contains a series of essays that deal with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it says:</seg>
<seg id="1190">This book wants to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built and what the real costs are with which this is connected.</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors who are involved in the movement for free knowledge have side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to make some sense from our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartouil, the beloved and celebrated Internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since 15 March 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was removed from the directory of the Adra prison, in which he sat on October 3, 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">Since then we have no information about its current state or residence.</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book entitled" "Collective Memory" "gives his friends and his family a voice calling for his release and wanting to know him back in his normal life and in freedom."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture, many of us have begun to think about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we choose?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up in this process of temporary extreme beliefs?</seg>
<seg id="1200">"since March 2012, the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in custody of Syrian government authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel was transferred from the Adra prison, a non-military establishment, to an unknown location."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, the writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly confidential" command of the military court from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported that she was contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad government and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"his whereabouts, however, remain unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a crucial role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">"maybe none of Bassels's cultural prototypes were more likely than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005, in order to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyras."</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations and here greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time, Bassel did not know that ten years after he began working with this work, the IS would do everything to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens, but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">"this expedition into the digital archeology and preservation has created a time capsule, which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future."</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and writes about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life with it, dreaming of freedom and Bassel taught me to embrace it."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed when I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I have learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he has always shared his knowledge with everyone who has asked him. he has taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how to use computers, at least theoretically, without actually holding one in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prozuch that she wrote to her husband in the years 2012-2015 when he was in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together on the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"she smuggled the lyrics to him, when she visited him and he translated it from Arabic into English."</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is freely available.</seg>

<seg id="1230">"that I lose my mind in the moment we embrace,"</seg>
<seg id="1231">"that I don't care about any of the dangers,"</seg>

<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption case, in which a government member returned to work in the state apparatus after half of his sentence to which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years in prison together with four other defendants for an inversion of 54 million Metikal (about 800 000 euros)."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds from the Mozambique airports, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good leadership and immediately called for his re-employment to the company, which happened on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement by the Attorney General of the Republic, which exemplified the motion, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to refer back to his old post as the company did not take any disciplinary proceedings after his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not mean the action well."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), a local institution committed to public transparency, condemned the decision of the company to resume the director in an interview with Deutsche Welle:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"" "represents a setback in the fight against corruption and illustrates the lack of transparency and is even a step backward with regard to the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the firm should also initiate disciplinary proceedings against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company apparently held no reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a significant voice in the Muslim social media, also rejects this behavior and looks at the case as" disguised ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza was a competent guy, he would be a consultant after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and of which half had served."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could hold paid talks and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he has agreed to be reintegrated into the company, which he helped inflict damage."</seg>
<seg id="1269">Therefore it is obvious: Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence.</seg>
<seg id="1270">Refutable!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"Bitone Viage, young Muslim and student of political science in Brazil says, the director no moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insulted him, I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already insulted the state so massively."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morality and to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead only served itself by the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">"Cambaza used the state as it was an inexhaustible source of money, and the state itself has become tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison sentence."</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeúte prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind a thief in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">Thieves belong to Samora Prison prison and will not only be remembered as the first independent president but also as a sharp thinker and - by the way - prophetic speakers.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral representations was when he affirmed that" an ambitious man is capable of everything, even the fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that he is not like that. he changes tactics, but he does not turn away from his ambitions. "</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious man is at the same time criminal. "</seg>

<seg id="1287">"the Burmese word" "Kalar pae" "means chickpea or bacon."</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the well-known social network took their posts from the net because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although it is still discussed about the origin of the word, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" Indian. ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "in Burma" "as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely depreciating connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims who represent a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in the effort to fight hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"Kalar'is normally associated with racism today, but the word itself does not automatically invoke hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that also posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word, have been censored for use of the word."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"in addition, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same character sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair on Burmese is also written 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters, as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Facebooking Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A post from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to ease his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase" "healing" "(ku) + the question word (la) on Burmese - resembles the racist expression very much, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different responses to the initiative of Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will reduce the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be more analytical before it removes all the posts that would be suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It automatically filters the word.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automatism will not understand what you write to Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the mail and check it by checking the opposite words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae. ""</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, receive a fairly good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to anyone who propagates hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not last long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China such as Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that censorship is often a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks are simply starting to use a new word or an alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">Author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook began to delete his posts when he wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banned from the social network:</seg>
<seg id="1315">... "when I became aware of this new directive on Facebook, I made a mail to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my post was removed from Facebook and I was forbidden to edit, post and share content for 24 hours because the post" "Facebook Community standards". ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or simply trying to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his views on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes to have a benevolent intention to reduce racism in Burma through their platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censing such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without local context or technical support and thus banned words like" "chair" "or" "pea curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only a little more respect for the 15 million benefits that would give them a big turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has provided a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users are now funny about Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the network."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which didn't have a hate speech but nevertheless removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads: "I want to sit on a chair and eat pea curry and watch an Indian film.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"just to try out if Facebook removes the mail, which contains the word" "Kalar". ""</seg>
<seg id="1333">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"the post says" "If you are a doctor, then heal people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"over the past five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks should additionally raise violence in the communities in Myanmar, especially in the Rakhine region, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook has been criticised for his failure to bring out the rampant hate speech on his Burmese sides."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of simply censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have looked better on the context rather than code-focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1344">"on 9 June 2017, the country's parliament unanimously approved a law banning this practice so that the age of marriage is now 18."</seg>
<seg id="1345">"before this change of marriage, some of the members of Hindi and Muslim religious communities held firm in practice, and in May 2016, Brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organization (IRO), said that the state should not interfere with the state, since the age of age does not determine maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago are a contractual partner of the UN Child Right Convention, the minors are defined as" "every person under 18". ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">"statistics of the UN for the years 2002-2012 show that the proportion of children who were married to 15 in Trinidad and Tobago was 2.8 percent, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the Federal Statistical Office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married in 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements that were eager to abolish laws for childbirth followed at the foot and enjoyed great support. undoubtedly, they helped to bring about this result."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no hesitation in saying to the critics of the children, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this really uncomplicated matter, and at some point there were doubts as to whether the opposition would agree to the bill."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the bill against the children's marriage was decided - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent, which contained, so that he could be discussed in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him a law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the president of the country must agree and let the law be announced.</seg>
<seg id="1355">"one of the country's senators gave a status update on Facebook, which again posted Leslie-Ann Boiselle on Instagram:"</seg>
<seg id="1356">"Mr. Senator Clarence Rambresat: the bill against the children's marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes for it, and no one against it."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"once it has been approved in the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"the majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws of childbirth have finally been changed."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"member of the Federal Ministry of Education, Lovell Francis, said:"</seg>
<seg id="1360">"it took too much time and unnecessary talk that obscured the core of the matter, but do you know what? child marriage is now illegal in Trinidad and Tobago, and this is worth almost every price."</seg>

<seg id="1367">"the draft to change the marriage network was decided today, on 9 June 2017."</seg>

<seg id="1375">"but a possible hook comes in the shape of Sat Maharaj, the Secretary General of the Sanatan Dharma Maha Sabha, the most famous Hindu organization in the country."</seg>
<seg id="1376">"months ago, Maharaj announced his intention to take judicial steps, the law should be passed, and he seems to accept his promise."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"while the Attorney General Paris Al rawi, a proponent of the law, said that it was quite legitimate when Maharaj wanted to act against the law, most social media users wished to approach the debate on the subject."</seg>
<seg id="1378">Patricia Worrell suggested:</seg>
<seg id="1379">"instead of talking about the problem, instead of talking about the problem that we, instead of talking about the problem, we would simply say that the state that protects our daughters from being misused by large, hard-boiled men who are facing them in the advantage of them, would you then be prepared to continue the discussion?"</seg>
<seg id="1380">Or do you think that this is not a problem?</seg>
<seg id="1381">"but whether it comes to court action against the law or not, this legislation is an important step - however, there are still places in the world where the children are legal or still the norm in various gradations, although there are laws that prohibit them."</seg>

<seg id="1390">"by mirroring web pages, Turkish users can look at Wikipedia content again"</seg>
<seg id="1391">"the Wikipedia page was presented internationally by the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA on January 18, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">"for over a month now, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle based encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day it becomes clear how important the platform is for users to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series fight against the blockage.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many tech-savvy internet users are used to use conversions for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third-largest VPN prevalence in the world), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking article from Wikipedia since 2008, as recently described in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007, after the Internet Law (Nr. 5651) has been adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the second best-known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform continues to remain locked, several Mirrors pages (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are frequently updated) have now appeared."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform placed all Turkish Wikipedia pages on its decentralized peer-to-peer network (i.e. host computer connections), which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete breakdown difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"despite the legal ban, the content is available."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about its efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after listening to the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put it all on putting snapshots from Wikipedia on the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content in distributed and distributed ways."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to at least view all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also announced that this step was carried out independently of the Wikimedia Foundation, and it is merely screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni of Wikimedia Italy has both tr.vikiansiklopedia, a Mirrorseite of Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that anyone can use to host similar Mirrors pages when in the respective country Wikipedia is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni reported Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member as well as collaborators at Mozilla in Panigrahi's Open Speaks "podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"it is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror."</seg>
<seg id="1410">You access another URL that is not the original. that what you see then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">"essentially, the server transfers the request to the correct Wikipedia page so that it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself, if these are locked in Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server that is not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">"Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with badly positioned motifs and well-balanced colors."</seg>
<seg id="1418">This motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">At that time he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar has tried to bring Nepalese wildlife to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, right next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Nepal's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how this first-class location in his work helps:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">"I was right at home when suddenly Rejazaj (the manager of Chitwan Gaida Lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father, that on the bank of the Rapti River a leopard would be."</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist resort of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I ran with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father observed him and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was and I immediately started to knit pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">"Sagar aims to cooperate with the authorities in order to obtain worldwide recognition for Nepal, and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as fearful as they look."</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know [it], for he stood by face to face from face to face:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be bothered by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness, when the king of the book suddenly appeared. he sat down immediately, we see ourselves and he stares me through the scarf-trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" I click for conservation "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on his photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"however, his passion for the promotion of Nepalese nature and wildlife is not always easy."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"he waited for 22 days, mostly living in a tent to take pictures of Ottern in Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took him to photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodation."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this post was written by Kayonaaz Kalytsa and was originally published on Video Volunteers, an award-winning international community media organization from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, women avoid the utmost care to pronounce the name of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">Instead they use a pronoun or say "father of my child."</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that they respect the husband because of social pressure, as well as the fear of the consequences, they should disregard the norm in keeping this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"last year, Malati Mahatoto was sentenced by a sham in the Indian state of Odisha and violated by her family and the village community after addressing a married couple with names."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of naming their wives also not by name is also common among men. however, they have far fewer rights to fear if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in Pune, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health personnel and housewives, joined a unique club and became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place for them alone to discuss and discuss the intricacies of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of the 56 clubs there are in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign, which is run by the community Video Volunteers and sets up for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Pawas has been working with her video camera for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as children's marriage to exile from HIV- and AIDS-infected, and manages this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">It reports how these clubs created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">"the first video that Rohini showed in her discussion rounds, acted by women who did not call her husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women could easily identify.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"speaking out of the name of her husbands is a custom, which they are all dutiful and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini believes:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never named her husband on behalf of her, wanted to try out at home, as it is."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion round her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video ended.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"Prakash, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him by his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">Rohini started his first discussion club with this confidence in his luggage.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchy "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">At the beginning of the round Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked every participant to tell the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us as they want, this means that they don't respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent?</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they gave the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paz from the village of Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of an age-old tradition in which married women can never pronounce the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini tells:</seg>
<seg id="1502">"a woman was so shy that she only chased herself in the whole practice, another she decided to release the whole frustrated frustration against him and his family by cursing it."</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the adrenalin rush of having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided that they would actually try to call their husbands at home."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the next few days, Rohini received a large number of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put the women in his head: his wife could not stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">Another woman said: "Rohini meant I should do it.</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation was in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as carrying the zinnoberred dot on the forehead, indicating the marital status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only have to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband that I would carry the zinnoberred dot, if he did."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He only laughed and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not stopped completely with it, but think that they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange views and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we make a trip to each discussion club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out into the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to worry about who could hear something," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In recent months she celebrated her own birthdays with cakes for the first time in her life; she danced and sang and talked about things she had never thought about before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked so honestly about some things, such as our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things out loud, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a panel discussion, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only supported saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it's okay, but some wanted to wear a saline curta, a wide shirt over a pair of pants, they did not dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much dispute and discussion about the advantages of their own dress code, morality associated with the saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own pair of Kurtas (Oberhemden) into a discussion round so that women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to plan a trip to Goa, where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed."</seg>
<seg id="1531">"on the question of whether something has changed in the five months since its first discussion club, Rohini confirms that things are moving slowly:"</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only made small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then they stopped saying the name of their husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including myself, are still doing it, but only when they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two continue to say the name of their husbands; only one or two women now carry Zinnoberrot on their foreheads at any time.</seg>
<seg id="1536">The women in the discussion club know that the changes they want to achieve in their lives - like haggling for more freedom of movement or choice of clothes - at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they become aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How to explain Rohini:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each one of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am it too.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not only limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we do.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all sitting in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" "messages from those they experience themselves" "and provide a hyperlocal context to report global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1585">"a new system of kidnapping of bald men for organ trafficking, presumably for unbelievers, worries the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"at the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi."</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and part of the organs had been removed.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently they conceded that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">"there is the local superstition that the head of a bald man could contain gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia explained to the BBC."</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on bald men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">"another group, the goal of murder for obscure purposes, is people with albinism."</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN in South African country led a mission to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">"the persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in the neighboring country of Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to fight this superstition and prejudice."</seg>

<seg id="1600">"the persecution and murder of bald individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, province of Zambézia, for supposedly disbelieving rituals, has commissioned cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also indicates that a belief exists, according to which the victims in the head might have power, the riches generate."</seg>

<seg id="1626">A photo of Liu Xiaobo and Liu Xia that was probably made recently.</seg>
<seg id="1627">"this story was originally published on July 8, 2017 in Hong Kong Free Press."</seg>
<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">"the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissident, Liu Xiaobo, attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he had been hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage."</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years in prison for" Subversion "(state threats), having participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto demanding democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">"the State Department in China referred to Lius case as an" "internal affair" "and told a speaker, he considered it" "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community to release Nobel Prize laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him a treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticised the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Hong Kong Free Press has summarised some reactions from abroad.</seg>
<seg id="1636">United nations</seg>
<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June in order to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman refused to comment whether the United Nations should exert pressure to allow Liu to be treated abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius Release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came to a halt, after the Nobel Peace Prize 2010 was awarded to Liu, although the Norwegian government said that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">"diplomatic relations were continued only in December last year. only in June, Norway signed an agreement to resume the salmon imports to China, as exports since 2010 were largely blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hopes for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his price."</seg>
<seg id="1645">During the ceremony Liu was represented by an empty chair.</seg>
<seg id="1646">European Union</seg>
<seg id="1647">"on 6 July, the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling on China to free Liu and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical support wherever he wants."</seg>
<seg id="1648">"the top diplomats of the EU, Federica Mogherini, also called on China to release Liu as announced in a statement on 30 June:"</seg>

<seg id="1653">"a spokeswoman for the US Embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced that the message agency AFP announced on June 27 that the message told the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu but also to free his wife Liu Xia from her house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the call of the US embassy attracted a furious response from China, with the exterior of the State Department that" no country has the right to interfere and make irresponsible remarks about Chinese internal affairs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley told that China should offer the following:</seg>
<seg id="1656">"protection and freedom, such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice, to which it claims according to the Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the U.S. senators Marco Rubio, Jeff Merkley and Ted Cruz have also introduced a decision in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Liu and his wife unconditionally."</seg>

<seg id="1663">Canada - Canada</seg>
<seg id="1664">"on 28 June, Canadian Ambassador John McCallum called China to provide Liu an adequate medical care and give him the opportunity to take care of his family."</seg>
<seg id="1665">"Lius attorney told AFP earlier that Liu's wife, Liu Xia, could visit him every day, but the police always supervised the room in the hospital and that it is not permitted to speak and contact with someone outside, including his lawyers."</seg>

<seg id="1677">He said about Liu:</seg>
<seg id="1678">"it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished would have led to a more harmonious, stable and prosperous China, which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world."</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid since Singapore is recognized internationally as an independent state.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmuck, Singapore should be considered a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark has triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the State of New York the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of the single political party of Singapore because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supports Singapore to be considered a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one has questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people make a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">The blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to "twist the logic" in order to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, we can say that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose land is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmuck were not very posh: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in view of it, he seemed invariably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities like Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities that are permanently led by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once one reaches the core point of the subject, the good old corpse appears again from the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the distorted logic because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end the last week of Shanglams gave answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system really non-answers."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He explained the corresponding questions with non-replies rationally.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng asks Shanmuck to clarify his opinion, since she did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmuck would take the effort to clarify this point as long as he was paid high to be part of the Government of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his commentary on the blog, he points out to the critics that one should start reading the entire transcript of the conference so that one could better understand the context of the statements of Shanmuck, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said that Singapore was rather a" "city" "than a country," "he explained why the elections in Singapore were so uneven, even if we enjoy free and just elections."</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore is not a country, he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmuck, who, as leader of a growing generation, makes such a polemic statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice said of Singapore, very embarrassed..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old Guard, what I expected - be I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmuck, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it, and is aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK Review crushes the weak points of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"has Mr. Shanmuck made a mistake" "believing a mistake" "or was it an advocate of Freudian?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, which country do the sovereign rights of the city of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">"Singapore is unique, it is both country and city."</seg>
<seg id="1723">"since he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmuck are of grave importance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, but do they defend their city, but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who does our prime minister have to pay back invoices?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our pink identity card?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"the magazine Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore is and has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody has ever said that Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, "etc., but that is not quite correct."</seg>
<seg id="1735">We should rather talk about the defence of the city.</seg>

<seg id="1740">"your answers will be published here as part of an ongoing series, with the rumors uncovered about certain parts of the world and a different facet is to be shown."</seg>
<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series is from Nevin Thompson, editor of Global Voices Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question that is most asked to me in Japan is: "are you Americans?</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I answer. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I live and back in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on what situation the conversation takes place, it is considered polite to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification mostly follows the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature. "many Canadians probably cook in anger if they are kept for Americans, but I don't mind that."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who does not know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians use a Canadian flag well visible on their backpack when travelling.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All the dear Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>

<seg id="1758">Canada is also considered to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups.</seg>
<seg id="1759">We are not as these guys at the south of the border.</seg>
<seg id="1760">We Canadians are nice.</seg>
<seg id="1761">I hate this.</seg>

<seg id="1763">"it wouldn't matter to me if you would change me, for example, with Johnny from Dallas."</seg>
<seg id="1764">With Marc from Austin.</seg>
<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first: to be called" "nice" "means to be spurious - like the benign, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" Die Simpsons "(who has one's Canadian double-Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada is really a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing to push."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be inconspicuous and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around one."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"I would even go to say that the desire to be free and alone, is a major achievement of Canadians."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">"what outsiders call" "nice" "is perhaps just cool courtesy."</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians don't often talk about the fence across the fence.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends."</seg>

<seg id="1781">"the new song" Dictator Girl "(Phadet Girl) of the band Tattoo Colour describes a young man, who tells of what regulations his girlfriend makes."</seg>
<seg id="1782">"although not explicitly political, the music video refers directly to the continued military rule of the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1783">The band was praised by many fans and other internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country.</seg>

<seg id="1786">"last month, even the Charlie Chaplin video" The dictator "was blocked in Thailand after a group of activists told the public to watch this video."</seg>
<seg id="1787">"the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics, especially as it relates to the situation of the country under the Junta domination."</seg>
<seg id="1788">"take a look at these videos, which refer to some of the political topics that Thailand has consistently pursued over the past three years."</seg>
<seg id="1789">"the" 44 rules of the girls "may relate to the draconian section 44 of the provisional constitution, which gives absolute decision-making over important national issues to the commander-in-chief of the army."</seg>
<seg id="1790">"the 11th rule:" change your attitude "refers to the notorious program to" change the imagination "of journalists, students, scientists, activists, politicians and other people who are considered critics by the junta."</seg>
<seg id="1791">"the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime, whose vague and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state."</seg>
<seg id="1792">"for this purpose a new unit was established in the army, supervised online content and persons accused of having slandered the monarchy, prosecuted."</seg>
<seg id="1793">Thailand strives strikingly against "Most Majestic" (Majestic insult).</seg>
<seg id="1794">"on 20 May 2014, martial law was declared in Thailand."</seg>

<seg id="1796">"one of the problems that the Junta continues to pursue is its decision to buy expensive submarines, although security experts warned them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax money."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez is a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>

<seg id="1897">This article by Amy Bracken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI.org and appears here with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants entering Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located at the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel near the city center.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"it is led by a 59 year old Mexican woman, a small woman with a coral-pink frame and golden earrings in teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">"it is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula, and grew up there. nevertheless, they know many of the name Mama Africa."</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is due to the fact that the hotel (or rather it itself) has become a destination for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel has no charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for approximately 2,50 Dollar the night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - yet hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Ms Ramírez narrates, people come in full minibus and from the upper part of the coast they start calling:" mum Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you mummy Africa?. "</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment it is rather quiet, but this year, Ramírez has already received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have already slept on cardboard."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She does not want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill, they buy medicines they cannot pay, they massage them with a balm the feet exhausted from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychy Sebastiao, originally from Angola, arrived short time ago."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">"the Sebastiao family (with her daughter Merrui, who has a yoghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez."</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel that it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to get to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"you have lived in Brazil, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then move towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He tells that Haitians and Africans often travel along the route and that Africans already speak to Whatsapp from Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet had previously lived in Brazil and worked as a construction worker on construction sites of the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy became weaker, he started his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I wonder if he will get in touch with Ms Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," "he answers smiling." "we will always stay in contact."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez told her guests send her often text messages when she went to greet her or to tell her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to cook chicken like in Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but it is not the only spark of hope for the migrants who travel through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city a dead end leads to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have taken migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that the bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar a night."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment, 25 people are there, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on ceilings on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking station outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela declares that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his job."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants traveling through Tapachula come from Central America, other residents also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me that in Honduras he fled with his wife and his three children from people who wanted to blackmail him money without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula, he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single traveller, offered him their roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where to go the next step."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, travellers are quietly looking for their telephones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"today, a minibus has arrived and has brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Ms. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic for those who have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she leaves her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair spots that she has made a client, some photos of her grandchildren and many travelers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sorrowfully while she presents her briefly.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," repeats them every time. "they have already gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check-point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang from twitter-users, in general,"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a cell phone notification in which it instructs the district government to install a surveillance app called Jingwang (or" "Web Cleaning" ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the message, it is said that the app" prevents access to terrorist information. ""</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than fighting terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report by Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they, shortly after installing the app, exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"in the communication of the police, the app would detect and prosecute the sources and distribution channels of terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information "including videos, images, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwangs website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protective service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main function is blocking pornographic websites, from online fraud, trojans and phishing sites to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the children's filters helps children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control the digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while news about digital censorship in China mostly focus on the experience of users in larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often gloomy for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions such as Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme harassures and surveillance measures, as well as routinely internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the Twitter-based media outlet" Images from mainland China, "published censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where police inspecting the residents indiscriminately whether they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification demanded that people install the app within 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use devices that are intended for older people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of captivity because of the rest technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from" "China" "also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can lift the password of a Windows operating system and thus get unlimited access to the hard drive of the computer."</seg>
<seg id="1985">"after installing Jingwang, computers and mobile phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs."</seg>
<seg id="1986">The regulations in Jingwang may be a response to the instructions of the City Council to minimise the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and affiliated institutions, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office when operating their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"Freedom House's current account, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, the authorities issued an order to register their personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards at the local police until 1 August."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos. "however, this promotion violates the personality rights of Urumtoris three million inhabitants and gives them punishment for a whole series of other possible offence, including those who refer to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="1998">One that has struck down in a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaphors.</seg>
<seg id="1999">"but when the reality recovers and you look behind the scenes - beyond the acting, the beautiful scenes and the performer - the characters turn into beings from flesh and blood, and everything cries after death."</seg>

<seg id="2006">"for the first time, it was quiet, motionless, at the wrong time, even though I did not make high demands on a city that is stuffed into the arteries with state security organisms and their accomplices."</seg>
<seg id="2007">"during the third night, things had a bit calmed down after listening to the electricity in the neighborhood."</seg>
<seg id="2008">I broke through the silence by screaming several times "Allahu Akbar" from my house roof.</seg>
<seg id="2009">I heard my voice disgusted by silence.</seg>
<seg id="2010">Few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to come together.</seg>
<seg id="2011">I was not alone.</seg>
<seg id="2012">"many friends, real friends joined me; we allied ourselves to a beautiful picture, which filled my expectations fully and completely."</seg>

<seg id="2015">He put on.</seg>
<seg id="2016">"then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow, nothing can give you your voice after you screamed it all the way up to the office of security service from the body."</seg>

<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes turned on me.</seg>
<seg id="2021">"and thou wouldest believe what to see me in the eyes, and not on the ground."</seg>
<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time I was standing in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was in my foolishness, vanity; perhaps at the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my case when I replied: "I wouldn't have thought that you have forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I have never stopped looking into your eyes, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest conversation that could have such disastrous consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said."</seg>
<seg id="2028">"put him in solitary confinement, and his father with them."</seg>

<seg id="2059">I didn't answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I got used to it not to answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can't really say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>

<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which has belonged to them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaib's family was forced to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they lived as felicyeen (roughly: farmers)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist who confronts the conservative majority and questioned her old-proven views on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapture."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with topics such as Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world. all these issues are not only relevant in his hometown of Amman relevance but also in cities which range from Damascus to Syria to Sanaa in Yemen."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not restricted by boundaries in his thinking, and he can sympathize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign interventions in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special reluctance against the US-American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Recorded by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have something to do with his identity as" Palestinian refugees of the second generation "- he calls himself even if he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances," says Hdaib. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I'm a man, "while in water, he shook up Nescafé in two cups. it's the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"apparently, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a scorching hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the sweats speak lukewarm coffee and the squat of the Kent-cigarette in the nose primarily of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when one looks at the neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - just as in the public during Ramadan to drink water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, the Jordaniens interior ministry cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou'Leila, already for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some parliamentarians who support the Islamic Action Front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that sexual orientation of the homosexual front singer Hamed Sinno contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country, and the main reason for the concert statement."</seg>
<seg id="2112">The deputies and former spokesmen of the Islamic Coalition Dima Tahboub spoke in an interview with CNN that the concert "just" was cancelled because of the sexual orientation of the singer.</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the engagement of the band in matters such as the Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the tried-and-tested legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou'Leila appreciated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights "who continue to use" intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be simply rhetoric but in fact reflect an ever more clearly emerging reality in Jordan, which appears clearly in Hdaib's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib returned traditional gender men to Leibe by forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have sex premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an unknown unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the screen."</seg>
<seg id="2118">It is surrounded by a red lake; perhaps the blood of the countless women who have lost their lives by the hands of those who should trust them.</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past years, the number of 'honorary orders' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to Human Rights Watch, the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still difficult to add that Jordan is missing institutional infrastructure to support women who have been victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate way."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a law banning crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can be kept in prison for an indefinite period, and for their release, many years of bureaucratic effort and the guarantee on the part of the family are often necessary for the woman to do nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"also Hdaib's music enjoys great popularity and is known to not shy away from themes, which are long as taboos in his country."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"politics was told to me," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" Lawla al 3aib "and in" Ghareeb, "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political at the heart can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song entitled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse often repeats often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market on which one, in his words," can get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, hetero- or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan spoke about the rights of gay and lesbians, and that comments on equality between LGBTQ + individuals were still censored by 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to remember that his comments from the context were ripped, distorted and his opinion was censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without incisions, but streamed was only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community, arguing that intolerance towards homosexuals is not contrary to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuda, a poet of the eighth century, who is still remembered today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuvo, who was later to work on behalf of the caliph, could openly write about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, have nothing to do with Mashrou'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the hashemite kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service seized several former government officials and members of the teacher's association, stating that they had critically responded to the problems on comments in social media, which are related to the corruption rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaib's opinion is just the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - this is what Hdaib sees - is made up of slow, deliberate and internal changes."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately, like millions of other Arabs, Hdaib dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of" experiencing "them."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will approach a real and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, cluster munitions and artificially provoked democracies. at least, he hopes."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist."</seg>

<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warrior dolls are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta Festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"one assumes that it is a variant of the Tanabata Festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the armoans, drums and dancing marched over more than a thousand years and come from a time when armies from the west of Japan marched into the north-east to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the disciples, to the knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta Festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to snap a few great seats, so we got a great view."</seg>

<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of the capital Lima, a region with a very high crime rate where street noise and illegal drug trafficking are all-day."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 percent of the population of this region would not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru, like many other Central and South American countries, is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous sportsmen such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to getting more and more normal citizens into the skilled hands of hairdressers that can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles that go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity has even inspired an annual event, the competition of the hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been held since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">"there, experts compete against each other to show who of them can create the most eccentric looks, as you can see in the following video (further videos on current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos)."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found here an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to obtain a training in the hairdresser art, which allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the possibilities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">"in 1995, we were the only specialist school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because we have built up this educational community out of love with the children."</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: letter of love to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with friendly permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the contribution" "Love messages to guerrilla fighters", "which published the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article will be published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not much more important, people who feel emitted to accommodate affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this is precisely the question of the young Colombian activists Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation, inspired by the campaign Carta por la Carliación (Letters to Reconciliation), which encouraged young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"only recently, their country was the scene of a historic event and they wanted to contribute to it: after years of negotiations the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces), which forms the closing point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the Peace Treaty was so significant that the Colombian president José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, before the Colombians, there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, were subjected to war rhetoric and carried their weapons around the clock, must now be integrated into the lives of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"the Colombian society in turn, who had become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases profound hatred of guerrilla fighters, must now take these into its ranks and support them in the construction of a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians must join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: until now thousands of young people have written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters, to welcome them back to society again."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"the aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerilla fighter, who will then be handed over personally."</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the Letters to Reconciliation was created on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. there, Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to briefly speak with Kailash Satyarthi, which was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this explained that we write thousands of love letters on Valentine's Day, but forget those who need much more."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans to share his love with people this year, who needed most attention."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"so the plan was to write letters full of hope and support for former fighters of the FARC, who now have to find their place in society and build a new life." "the letters will show that the Colombian society is ready to make discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected as part of the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities of Colombia like Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I would never have thought that someone would be forgiven</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono-Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the Municipality of Cali and Leonardo, travelled to the camp to bring the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">The FARC members set up as they had done before to counter the orders of their leaders.</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they received no orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it is incredible how many different feelings one can go through in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "told the political scientist Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, a member of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former warrior led me through the camp of the guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I saw in one of the" Cambodians "(a kind of hut in which the guerrilla fighters live), I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because next to him on the bed was a MGL-garnet, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said," "Hello, what are they doing?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone has written to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very nice and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life someone has written something so beautiful, so I answer it." suddenly the tears ran over the cheeks. "</seg>
<seg id="2214">"I hugged him quite firmly, and set me beside the pomegranate."</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he was tired of the war, tired of being the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">"the man told me more about his life. he had never expected anything else from life as a war. to join the FARC, was the only way to keep him and his six brothers in front of starvation." I would never have thought that someone would forgive me for my mistakes. "</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society out there who waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have learned how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"for the first time, students and some leaders of the FARC have joined a discussion round."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up when already there was war and the FARC had already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"therefore, the leaders of the FARC declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years we have experienced how social injustice on the part of the State worked on the whole Colombian people. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"for a purpose of this magnitude, it is worthwhile to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who have never heard their hearing and had no right to vote, and to realize that the people I have often seen as monsters and even hate those who were turned around by their living conditions and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - including those who killed and so much damage, can teach us something and give us a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the camp commander in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the city of Cali, the following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombian was prophesied that peace would prevail after disarmament.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people who are ready to take up arms, rise and protest for their rights. and this is fully justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC are now putting on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call upon all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong to - to rise above all those who dream of a country in the war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is simple. those of us who defend life as the basis of existence will face many difficulties."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with horrors, activists have witnessed the reporting of the last months about the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat posed by a ladies complaining about the local LGBTQ community is not just over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">OC media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what is currently happening in the Republic.</seg>
<seg id="2247">"several months ago, the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya has captured the international headlines after reports have been published that deal with the spread, torture and killing of queer men in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Novaya Gazeta; she threw a light on the methods of Chechnya authorities who captured suspicious queer men and put them into secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"they have brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transwoman, was born in Grozny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt that she was a woman in reality."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"as she grew up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, which is why she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after experiencing a group of Chechens from the sex equation of their countrywoman, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"for fear of her life, she moved to the USA in the end."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer helper in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread her everywhere on the internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" "then there are no more men in Chechnya who can remove this confusion?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">"after that, the photos of my documents made the lap through WhatsApp."</seg>
<seg id="2261">"on October 10, 2015, I was attacked."</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was about to pick up some shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying:" here is a gift for you from your uncle. "</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I didn't hurt."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard another sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" how long will you still honor the family, you dishonor? "</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">"then I lost consciousness, and eventually woke up in the hospital."</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had everything with them and started to scream.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two stitches in my right lung wing."</seg>
<seg id="2272">OC Media: in which wings were you placed - in the men or women?</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it; but the doctor understood and laid me on the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I read his name for the first time at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him that he has been respectful of me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">"last February, I got threats."</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote to me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbours and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they asked me to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they ordered absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by going through the streets without going through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official television in Grosny and say that I didn't change my gender, that everything was just bad talk, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what would I have to say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it is still difficult for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You have brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family, but the entire republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">"my mother became too much, and she lay down a rope around her neck."</seg>
<seg id="2292">Luckily the neighbours came and saved them.</seg>
<seg id="2293">At the time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window there was a car with darkened windows and a license plate with a 95."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, I realized that there was something rotten."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother when I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering for me, without proof, without anything."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the garbage.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number was registered on a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" you don't believe that you were safe, just because you left the country? "</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know in which hotel you are stuck. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is the number 115. "</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine it?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">This was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we do not talk about gender equality, this is a taboo theme."</seg>
<seg id="2316">Some traditional Caucasian elements I still wear in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I really care how to look at the person she reminds of her past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report last week in Washington.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I spoke to someone who sat in argun for one and a half months.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that everyone could hardly wait for the end of Ramadan, and he did not exclude a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relative.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with this I mean, they probably invite the relatives who take care of the problem with the person concerned and at the end demand proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are there even gay men detained in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there wouldn't be so many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives to face Kadyrows's court."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can present them later as terrorists."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "Should it be killed, they will show their bodies on TV and claim they would have attacked any village or a military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, they were specifically submerged in order to radicalise."</seg>
<seg id="2336">OC Media: is this only a presumption or do you have a source for this information?</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There was nothing new from them since then.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was himself there when these people were taken away."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now they were not presented as bandits, but there were no reports on this yet. we suspect that such actions are quite possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would it not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and abductions of people who belong to a so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">I think already before 2003 I was already known in quite Grosny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems.</seg>
<seg id="2348">In earnest!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when the sharia was true, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia wanted to introduce us to" "civilisation", "but finally threw us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had dyed eyelashes, wore tubular jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never hurt me just one hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian Theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, met a whole group of people like me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people, met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We were never offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying:" "Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "Don't think about the misfortune of another."</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they believed you were sick?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they have never offended me, never chased, and never struck."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this grace period last?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov stepped onto the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he started talking about morality in television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us per se, but above all about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how people started to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"whoever laughed and laughed before, looked at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in time, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the Republic grew steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you have to do now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as a activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">"currently, I am responsible for 15 Muslim women."</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize tea meetings, meetings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get food cards."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't pay a cent for that.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I discovered these people myself when I applauded randomness.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that's silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"thus, nature is pure, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as Chechens, who want to know foam before the mouth that there are no gays at them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestans have which, the cabiners, have which, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet there is it - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it is unpleasant for me to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims going to the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know many think about transients to men who love men, and they believe that you change his sex to make more intimate experiences. but that's a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling, to be exact, different life settings."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not to be ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not if I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"sorry that I become so personal here, but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago."</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all - I simply know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase in suicide within the impoverished Arab Ahwazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian Ahwaz region suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the local Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide."</seg>
<seg id="2398">The photo of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patriotic Arab Democratic Movement in Ahwaz.</seg>
<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-burning of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 pushed the desperate situation of the Arab Ahrazi community in Iran, which is shaped by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moreii was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered from anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability to pay for his family, so Ahwazi human rights groups who work in Ahwaz and want to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments when he lighted himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was brought to the Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that the doctors couldn't do anything any more."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died shortly afterwards.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that happened in August within the Arab Ahrazi Minority, and activists on site warn that more men could take life."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights announced that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim - hung."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have a thing in common: they were all family patriarchs, who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of persecution by the Iranian government."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahrazi are suffering from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, where most of the Arab Ahrazi community lives in Iran, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Ahwaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran, until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and made great efforts in 1925 to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and valuable commercial areas for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of that wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often the victim of untreated diseases, hunger and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahrazi-Arabians in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a variety of dams, the water from the Arab areas into the Persian territories, where the provinces Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom are located."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to worsen the devastation caused by dryness in the region, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawzi young people now rose to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian Director General for Cooperatives, Labour and Social Welfare, reported that 5% of Ahwazis who seek a job, completed primary school, completed 55% of secondary school, and 45% have university degrees."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... aimed at annihilating the spirit of national resistance"</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, an Iranian ancestral human rights activist, resident in London, told Global Voices that the current situation, a mix of" poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "in the number of suicide among the young Ahrazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">"for this reason, a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is the reason for this."</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since functionaries and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, local Arab Ahrazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and force them to earn their livelihood outside their native Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and so hired as even Arabic names at the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak Arabic language or wearing Arab clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances given by the Arab Ahrazi, human rights activist alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking knowledge of it.</seg>
<seg id="2429">The main reason for suicide is untreated depression.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify myself with feminism, also with the intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. recorded by: Pixabay. published under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and published on the Afroféminas website. the article was the subject of several discussions in which many different positions were printed.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments under the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I'm not a feminist, many women - especially white women who call themselves intersectional feminists - are frustrated."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even lay well thought out scientific and social arguments before me why I should be feminist and why we should generally be all feminine.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, despite equal education women still earn less money than men nowadays."</seg>
<seg id="2441">Women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they are allowed to do with their bodies.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still ensure that women sooner or later encounter a glass ceiling in various areas of life, and that discrimination on the basis of sex is still moving across the many different countries and beliefs."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer twice and threefold."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet: when I come to speak on skin color, on racism, on black Cis women, on black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have been abused physically, mentally and verbally, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists choose to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"however, all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift up their voices" "and" "Kumbaya, my Lord" "to achieve equality (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they do not want to talk about it, in addition to sexualized violence, there is an institutionalized form of racist-motivated violence, which we are facing black women in two times."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic and ethnic origin deserve less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background more often refer to school than white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">"or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership, as white women."</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women to have all men and all men of any skin color the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose center the white woman stands who refuses to take into account injustices in her mind, which refers to both sex and skin color."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my part in a white-feminist-oriented sphere, which has always rejected me and countless other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner expressed in her speech:" "am I not a woman?" "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is a dehumanly and marginalized being in historical terms."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups, which also absorb our customs and customs through cultural appropriation, in order to expedite their egocentric program."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for the feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them of a better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women of different backgrounds a home and isolate themselves from white feminism, there is still the word" feminism "in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and join the movement of the Womanism, which was created for my dark skin and my status as a woman, which is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">"now it is more important than ever, that we define black women in accordance with our own ideas and move into the spheres that are created by us for us."</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: recall (e.g.: Africa-Womanism: as we recapture ourselves) speaks of that we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can thus also create spaces in which they are perfectly safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, mental, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists are immediately calling separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself about hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment I can raise black women and women from other cultures, because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I will be recognized as a part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life is neither bypassed nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddling against pollution: a man's mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this post by Todd Reubold was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine which reports in particular about international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published here again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"again and again, Nabil Musa traveled in the past 7 years - mostly with a surfboard or in canoe - with a special concern by the Kurdistan region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for current and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">"in this documentation of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa, who explains his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution on his community."</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I really wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was a child," "says Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the Non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - who is committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa summarises the urgency and importance of his work in a question:" if we had no water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and edited for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq-based documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the focus of her work lies on persecuted, little noticed subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, with the help of oppressed communities to tell their stories in their own way."</seg>
<seg id="2477">Paraguays women and their difficult fight against violence</seg>

<seg id="2480">"the following article is the abbreviated and edited version of the article" "The wave of violence against women in Paraguay". "the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# weilicheinefraubin), which reports on the violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissar, Ada Báez, said that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of their relationship, some time has passed and the police said that their statement would be put to the acts, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman showed Balbuena because of abuse, the informed indication of Ada Báez was not useful."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman moved back."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women do not pay any advertisement at all, they generally do not receive support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men who abuse them. this also explains why only 20% of all women admit to being victims of violence, in general report to the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"1 Strike and Statistical 2 Invisible mistreatment and a legal system, which is nothing inferior to Paraguays laws: good approach, lack of implementation impacts and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to see how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social science research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the figures available are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Attorney Office opened 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. 70% of these were violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads in the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">"there were over 5000 adverts for domestic violence in the courts of peace. here, too, 86% of the ads of women came."</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically mistreated, 55% of women spoke of psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">"however, these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan Women's Minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually indicated." "for every woman who is refunded in Paraguay for psychological abuse, 9 women who do not do this."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on any woman refunded for physical abuse, two women who do not do this," she explained at the end of 2014. "</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since women's murder in Paraguay is not a criminal offence, the prosecution authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered every year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists counted at least 12 cases of murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator of human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman dies due to violence caused by men."</seg>

<seg id="2504">Invisible mistreatment and a legal system that undertakes nothing</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she called him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning she didn't want it, but she still gave up. this should be regrettable forever."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer together with Carlos. but for two years she bore the psychological violence, one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most recognisable:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I would never have thought that I would once become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that only women are going to be subservient because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse of Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"naming her name, she wrote articles on Facebook in which she described his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their contributions, including Carlos myself. he asked rhetorically whether he had ever lifted his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">Other Facebook users asked Mariana why they had fallen for so long by Carlos and didn't leave him earlier.</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost as if they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least a certain complicity.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, who did not come from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay, in order to prove that her former partner abused her."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the Yo te Creo network ("I believe you") consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others don't do: they take the testimonies of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">"in Victorias's case, everything started with psychological abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her wealthy partner eventually even managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began to beat them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"at Victorias advertisements with the authorities remained without a result and also from their relatives, they received no support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a trial against her former partner, who developed into an obscure legal struggle between Paraguay and her home country, where it was mainly about money, power and the influence of its former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">Paraguays laws: good approach to poor implementation</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"the announcement of abuse is a path of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organisation for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan parliament, which was known under the hashtag # Porellas (# FOR)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the # NiUnaMenos Movement (# Non-Aligness) are part of a Twitter campaign that is supported by Amnesty International.</seg>

<seg id="2587">"Ranjit Warrier 2016 in Zambia, shown with his consent"</seg>
<seg id="2588">Medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned or not mentioned in the media. it is a growing area addressing one of the most pressing needs of the continent.</seg>
<seg id="2589">There are two reasons for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand many medicines and vaccines are missing in the offer of the global healthcare system that cover the specific medical need on the African continent.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have far more serious effects in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for research on these diseases by the pharmaceutical companies is a major problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research, which is carried out by African scientists, helps build their own research capacities in Africa. a greater role of science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"Dr. Ranjit Warrier is Director of the Central Laboratory at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia, CIDRZ."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"in the 1990s, he grew up in Lusaka, Zambia, just as the AIDS epidemic showed the first serious impact on national health."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"he left Zambia for a study in the United States, first in Louisiana, later in Indiana."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"as a postdoc at the University of Pennsylvania, he himself investigates the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Sambian health system."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"with Global Voices, Dr. Warrier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about misunderstandings of the media about this research."</seg>

<seg id="2599">"Ranjit Warrier RW: at the moment, the main focus of my work is on the application of research results."</seg>

<seg id="2604">"that has to change, otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being a creator."</seg>

<seg id="2616">AGA: what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa?</seg>
<seg id="2617">"RW: there is already interest, but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods."</seg>
<seg id="2618">I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation.</seg>
<seg id="2619">"GM: how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa, what should it focus on, and how can we support the development?"</seg>
<seg id="2620">RW: the potential is amazing.</seg>

<seg id="2623">"social sciences, computer sciences, big data, study of space, healthcare (non-communicable and infectious diseases) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly."</seg>
<seg id="2624">"GV: can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa versus Western countries, based on your experience?"</seg>
<seg id="2625">"RW: it is often the limited speed to do things, and the difficult access to scientific expertise, which pose challenges here."</seg>
<seg id="2626">"the system that magazines only make available for payment (the so-called" Paywall "), also limits the amount of information available and the speed of research."</seg>
<seg id="2627">"from the USA to India: how" "open source" "seed producers change global food production"</seg>
<seg id="2628">"this post by Rachel Cernansky was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine about solutions for environmental issues around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding in the United States since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outreddish, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many salad sorts he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not continue to use them for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents differ not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"over the past few years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereals or cartons. based on this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia old tradition, Morton continues to breed lettuce, but he needs longer since his work is becoming increasingly difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It's like lying in a river a boulder to whom I have to paddle.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do that now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents go too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before the court, no one can breed a new salad bar, because all the features are already patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, he is very careful and endeavours to use no material protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">It has also joined a movement that is becoming ever greater in the USA and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("open source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">Astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman salad of the Outredgeous variety in the "greenhouse" of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space.</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like that the movement from the IT area would come from and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for Open Source seed) is inspired by the free "Open Source" software that provides alternatives to copyrighted software.</seg>
<seg id="2645">It was launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, called Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they do not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open source "breeders merely allow others who buy their seeds, cross it in order to breed their own varieties, and do not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the emeried professor at the University of Wisconsin Madison and Ossi board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants are both important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"according to seeds, seed plays a role in greater contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control of the food system and use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to exploit the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg emphasizes that the "open-source" movement is not concerned with genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all kinds of plants could be patented, whether vegetable, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." "in order to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed," "he says and participates in the increasingly frequent fusions offered by ChemChina and Syngenta and Monsanto and Bayer, which are offered in August and September 2016."</seg>
<seg id="2654">"food sovereignty without seeds sovereignty is not possible." ""</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed initiative commit themselves to keep their seeds available free of charge. in contrast, their approach is to patent seed and plant traits."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is compromised, as the available genetic pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasing number of intellectual property rights to plant material that is becoming increasingly limited."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has worked in her doctoral thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"such estimates are not yet available for other plants, but experts like Luby suggest that mass-fed plants such as wheat are still patented as salads or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from those who improve their taste or colour to those, due to which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties point out that the available plant material for breeders is increasing by more and more patents. however, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever before, since changing conditions by climate change are much less predictable."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto spokeswoman Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts that intellectual property is owned by other breeders, as" patents and protection of plant varieties promote innovation. "" a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expires. "</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to come with another method of the same result.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but promotes it by making more material and know-how available to the public."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees it differently: 20 years to wait, until a patent expanders, certainly does not promote innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"if one has to wait so long to breed on plants adapted to the changed environmental conditions, one would have already lost the struggle."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, Morton's main argument is that genetic resources have always been a common good and should remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">"" "we want farmers to make their work easier."</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us forward, and it will be impossible for us if we can't continue to use the best and latest genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"in all, Morton interferes with the concept of developing plant traits:" we don't really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants form themselves and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do this.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in the US state of Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" he who breeds a variety breeds his own values in them. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"who believes in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for whose cultivation mass-wise herbicides are needed, which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized companies (such that move on international markets, but smaller than for example Monsanto) patents possess, they create most smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patenting or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for salads in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in addition, Morton believes that breeders are more innovative through avoiding plant patents:" it looks like I am striving to produce something new with my efforts to produce new, stronger than companies that are patented. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue, since I know that my competitors are selling my varieties myself in a few years," he says. ""</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be leading in the" "open source" "breeding, the concept is spreading rapidly all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (" Centre for Sustainable Agriculture "), which describes itself as a professional organisation in the field of resources, is a" open-source "seed programme."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "open source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German organisation Agrecol is working on an open source license, which ultimately constitutes a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi obligation for breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">(regulations for breeding differ from country to country where the Ossi obligation cannot be easily incorporated into one in Europe or other parts of the world.)</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the Executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable. thus, it speaks against the current practice of the European Patent Office, which permits patents on conventionally bred plants."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not yet a law; now it is in the governments of the Member States to bring the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference entitled" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia, on which farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives from governments, NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa came together to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the global trend for patenting seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' program for Open Source seed systems, states that the organization is currently building a worldwide alliance for open source seed systems, for scheduled next year the official launch of the seed."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"an association of environmental protection and development groups (including Hivos, the International Nonprofit Development Organisation USC Canada and the Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration - Action Group on erosion, technology and concentration) has compiled a database about seed and biodiversity worldwide to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report published by the UN Kellogg Foundation, McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also emphasises the importance of a diverse, local supply of seeds for sustainable food systems - a connection between the Luby of Ossi hopes that more people will soon see him."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological foods has particularly been taken care of where and how something is grown, and seed systems have hardly played a role in doing so," says Luby. "we are now trying to make people clear that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2726">"ANHRI is considered the first censored website of a human rights organization in Egypt, after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago, such as the independent news page Mada Masr, Arabic-language edition of the Huffington Post and the Al Jazeera network due to alleged" support of terrorism.

<seg id="2728">"in addition to ANHRI, the blog of the columnist and human rights scientist Ahmed Gamal Ziada has no access to Egypt."</seg>
<seg id="2729">Ziada used his blog for the distribution of columns and articles that he writes for in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>
<seg id="2730">"now the blog, which he directed to bypass the censorship of the Egyptian government, was even the target of an attack."</seg>
<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider for whom also Ziadas blog is given a home, on the other hand, is still accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photo journalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after being arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police exercised bodily force against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve primarily around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the blocking by the government and reflected what this means for him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"blocking blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and although the blocking of blogs may not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"they succeeded in giving me the feeling of a state of siege. arrest, attempted murder, summons at the National Security Council, blocking blogs and any other web site I worked for."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proven that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, although only to a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">First I used it to post articles to circumvent the censorship.</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte), Egyptian authorities blocked from 24 May to 06 August 133 websites. this resulted in technical tests in networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), including Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"furthermore, afte documented the blocking of providers, through the hugging of internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">Afte reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites that VPNs offer began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">Such a practice indicates the government's intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users could have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is also worsened by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, which means that the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed to trial against these actions."</seg>

<seg id="2753">"day after day, newspapers in all of Brazil report news from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motives."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old was shot in school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Thieves rauben pharmacy with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, Navy and Air-Port to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the middle of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the violent wave of 2017 in Rio reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice even called on the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable & # 8212; you will find at least the manager of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"the newspaper" Extra "published on August 16, published for detailed reporting on violence in Rio, published the editorial" This is not normal "in which it announced a new section called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports of violence in the city are now being published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The paper explains the motives for their decision as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"extra will continue to report on crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sexual crimes, etc. everything, which deviates from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the section" "War in Rio". "(...) This is our way to call: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative that we as journalists do not close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, stated that this decision was not a reason for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">Extra is probably the only newspaper around the world with a war rubric in a country that does not recognise the war at all.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"in the same video, a journalist of the newspaper states that according to the Institute for Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro 843 there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the paper continues:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to cover atrocities of the police, which only shoots and then asks questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira argue against the violence as a" war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investments in personnel, education and a historical and self-leveling neglect of public service."</seg>
<seg id="2774">"as a reminder, the state of Rio de Janeiro is bigger than its capital."</seg>

<seg id="2780">"in addition to Globo, the largest media company in South America, which, as Cecília stresses, has been repeating the state's security policy for years."</seg>
<seg id="2781">"these security policy measures also included the establishment of the UPP (Unidade de Polícia Pacificadora), a police unit established by the state of Rio in 2003, whose aim is to conquer a favela by deploying a massive police patch and permanently stationing a unit there."</seg>
<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of violent deaths. however, after several reports on shkanes and repressions against the poor communities, which was supposed to protect the newly created police unit, the UPP was increasingly bombarded."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux published one of his articles in 2010 in which he explains why the violence in Rio would not comply with the criteria designated for the term" civil war. ""</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as a war also draws serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to use means and paths that are typical of a war. this includes entering into the territory of a" enemy, "where a civilian is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object for" collateral damage "and" lost spheres. ""</seg>

<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and around the country, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"particularly strong is the East Ghouta region, where chemical weapons attack on August 21, 2013 called for hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organisations and the Syrian opposition assume, based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations, that the massacre was perpetrated by the Assad regime."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebels have been subjected to controlled areas outside Damascus, which led to the need for residents to be locally produced or smuggled by tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"thanks to the many years of blockade, traditional food such as meat has become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>

<seg id="2810">"mushrooms are not among the traditional foods planted in Syria, and are only rarely part of the Syrian cuisine. however, their food is an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta."</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the Directly of the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we chose fungi cultivation because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices, who has been fighting for three years to make this project known and expressed his relief that it is gaining more and more prominence."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in order to collect money for the initiative, we use the humanitarian crowdfunding platform Cando in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda."</seg>

<seg id="2816">"at the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached more than 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 Euro, but will continue to collect donations to Cando until Monday, September 4th 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">Dr. Leila said Global Voices that they began with the "production of mushrooms from the regions" before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption.</seg>
<seg id="2820">"after that, they planted a small mushroom yard in a tub. as this succeeded, they used a larger bath. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have designed a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months, they have spread mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta for free."</seg>

<seg id="2833">"on October 21, several hundred people protested in many districts of Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal."</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two people died and about 70 were injured as a result of forest fires from 15 to 16 October. this led to the last week of solidarity with the victims of the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">Fires were also registered in the Galicia region in Spain where there were 4 dead.</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks, which spread in the northern and central regions of the country and reached about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy occurred in Pedrógão Grande where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest surveillance system, which monitors the forest areas via satellite imagery, around 500,000 hectares of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>

<seg id="2848">"after Pedrógão, roads and villages were evacuated for everything and nothing."</seg>

<seg id="2851">"furthermore, building permits in locations with a high risk of fire are questioned."</seg>
<seg id="2852">"a far-reaching proposal for the forestry form, which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005, was objected by the municipalities which saw the new rules as an obstacle to investment."</seg>
<seg id="2853">"the government introduced a loosening of the law, which allowed construction activity from case to case if the applicant had funds for self-protection - that was an open backdoor, so that everything could be built," João Sorval resigns in the same article of the Público newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="2854">"the environmental organization Quercus pointed out that large areas with eucalyptus, trees made of readily combustible wood, as in a vicious circle, spread further and further, as in a vicious circle."</seg>
<seg id="2855">"these issues include the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on 15 and 16 October, as citizens seeking information or trying to contact relatives, offline."</seg>
<seg id="2856">It was a private initiative that provided the population with information: they used their own civil protection data through the application foils and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires.</seg>
<seg id="2857">"the project was launched in 2015 by the developer João Pina to simplify the work of the fire brigade and was so crucial that the servers didn't stand up to the 400,000 users who followed the fires: the website counted more than half a million hits."</seg>

<seg id="2885">"the Taliban, well-known for their hatred, came closer and closer."</seg>
<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country toward Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf was found in Pakistan."</seg>
<seg id="2888">For a few years he worked in a coal mine. the work was heavy and made him sick.</seg>
<seg id="2889">Once again he found himself in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged sacks with mortar which were heavier than he himself to earn his livelihood.</seg>
<seg id="2890">"back then, like today, Afghan refugees in Iran have been characterised by poverty and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really tough," Asharaf remembered in an interview with Global Voices. "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the construction site, on which we also worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There were no services there and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we didn't freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and prepared for the trip to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing over the sea he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited island of Greece."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time Asharaf was homeless, ran alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed twice a day food to needy."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"it is true that Italy is a second chance for asylum seekers due to relatively high payment rates. however, it is also true that the conditions governing asylum seekers in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The Civil Liberties Union for Europe's human rights organisation writes the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "special reception centres". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and unprepared personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to Italian law, asylum seekers can only be allocated to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which may withdraw for months after the registration of the application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who have no money for accommodation either depend on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So it was also Asharaf.</seg>
<seg id="2903">But his untamed lifestyles helped Asharaf to get rid of these conditions soon.</seg>
<seg id="2904">"after several years of working in the construction industry, Asharaf set his entire savings into the establishment of a hostel in Venice."</seg>
<seg id="2905">This went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a bite stop.</seg>

<seg id="2915">"in recent years, some of Afghans were created, including tailors, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
