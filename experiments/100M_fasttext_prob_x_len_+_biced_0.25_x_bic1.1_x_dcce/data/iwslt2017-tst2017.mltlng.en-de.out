that is James R@@ isen .
they might know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before someone had heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA was illegal tel@@ eph@@ ones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this , he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA sent Iran literally blu@@ ep@@ r@@ ints for a nuclear bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who didn &apos;t like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against R@@ isen and called upon him to name his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern to condemn whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers and spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the first constitutional complaint , the media have the right to publish cover@@ t information . &quot;
&quot; but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information , and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal . &quot;
&quot; so when the government le@@ aning against R@@ isen , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters were doing before him : he refused and said he would rather go to jail . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen lived with the risk of going into prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the process , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , although for years that it would be essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped against orph@@ ans . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic monitoring the re@@ porters and sources can always hide less .
&quot; instead of reti@@ ring and raising money , this could also carry out his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly concerned his telephone conversation , &quot;
&quot; as well as his e @-@ mail data , financial and bank information , his credit , and even travel notes with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and ris@@ ens alleged source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , but instead , the judi@@ ci@@ ary condem@@ ns more than all U.S. governments . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security has been the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government allows the government to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; and indeed , they can do that from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software that didn &apos;t exist when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; one such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source covering system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , originally developed by the internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an e @-@ mail , go to a news site like that of the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload documents or send information , as with any regular contact form . &quot;
these are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access .
&quot; so the government cannot obtain more information secretly , and many of the information they would like would not be available from the start . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spi@@ onage technologies that je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important for us to ensure that not only techn@@ ologists such as Edward Snow@@ den have the possibility of bringing mis@@ deeds . it is equally important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
or the next environmental worker who al@@ erts the alarm to the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a wall street insi@@ der who warns us before the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; on 3 April 2016 the biggest data leak of history was published . &#93; &#91; the &quot; Panama Papers &quot; revealed that rich and mighty &#93; &#91; huge sums of money have been hidden in tax ha@@ v@@ ens &#93; &#91; what does that mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93;
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up this ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , as the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has already resulted in very direct consequences .
Iceland &apos;s Prime Minister has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has stamp companies in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a track of $ 2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are waiting nerv@@ ously for the next release , and the next documents revealed . &quot;
now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems we@@ ep away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should that happen to us ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not to pay all their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that affects all of us .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , media and leading politicians , like secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens , will be used to hide and obsc@@ ure their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people this whole world seems very conf@@ using , and it &apos;s hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a mat@@ r@@ yo@@ ff capsule .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters . &quot;
I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA .
&quot; presumably because there were so far no prominent Americans , who came to this sc@@ andal in these revelations . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortun@@ es in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; however , by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens function , Mos@@ sack Fon@@ sec@@ a has fewer American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data leak from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some U.S. states you need less information , less information must be given to form a company than to get a library card . &quot;
this kind of in@@ transparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children .
sc@@ amm@@ ers have allowed sc@@ amm@@ ers to rip off particularly vulnerable off@@ springs .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator turned out to be an African minister , who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the US to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shocked that all of us made suggestions for a lawyer to our investig@@ ator how he could transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as a client , and of course nobody was given money . but it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our hidden investig@@ ator .
&quot; it is not about a single leading politi@@ cian , involved in a sc@@ andal . &quot;
&quot; it is about how the system works through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and to cope with this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult .
&quot; this may sound very melanch@@ oly as if we could do nothing about it , as if nothing had ever changed ; as if there is always the rich and powerful . &quot;
but as a born optim@@ ist I see quite well that a lot has started to change .
&quot; in the past few years , we have seen incidents towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the theme took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland .
&quot; since then , the EU has registered in central registers on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary groups , but this does not make the progress we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge glimpse into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies .
&quot; we need leaders in the economy , who get up and say : &quot; transparency is not good for business . &quot; &quot;
we need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of in@@ transparency .
&quot; together we can finally end the in@@ transparency , which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
this is the story of how I almost ab@@ duc@@ ted and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ da .
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a back@@ yard sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my stuff .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip through the whole country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I was tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
he made the whole thing worse : &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who does not know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans it . I don &apos;t want to be kidn@@ apped in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small luggage space !
then I heard myself saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; W@@ ho@@ m , please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get into it ? &quot;
a stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I got out of bed , slept on toes at the door , and my bedroom door closed . &quot;
but he was not mad at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom . he is now a teacher .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered ?
&quot; when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s take a time leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost bank@@ rupt , my room@@ mate pul@@ ls out and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think creativity can create it , turn fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and established so &quot; air mattress and breakfast &quot; &#91; A@@ IR@@ B a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on a wooden floor .
they found it great and we too .
&quot; I am sure , our cheese ham om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made it for our guests . &quot;
&quot; when we passed our last guest and dropped the door into the castle , Brian and I started . &quot;
have we just discovered that we found new friends at the same time and could pay our rent ?
things came into the roll .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept .
&quot; this is how we presented to the investors : &quot; we would like to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the internet , they can invite other people to stay overnight . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the rocket to ign@@ ite .
but they did not .
&quot; no one , who is still in comfort , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you look at the things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create an immense trust through design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design make something like that ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we aimed at .
it is a 30 @-@ seconds experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone out .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into the hand .
now I would like to unlock your mobile phone .
enter your un@@ locked cell phone from your left seat neighbour .
this quiet p@@ lowing of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read your SMS , they see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most people feel the responsibility .
this is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else .
only for this reason can our company exist .
&quot; just like that , who actually has Al Gor@@ es Handy ? &quot;
could you tell on Twitter that he is chann@@ eled to the Office of the President ?
you can now return the cell phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I would like to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had first introduced himself with his name ; if he had told wh@@ ence he came from , how his dog or his children were called ? &quot;
imagine you had 150 assessments that all say : &quot; he can really hold on very well sprung cell@@ phones !
how would you feel if you had to hand over your mobile phone ?
because a well @-@ thought out feedback system rein@@ forces the trust .
in the beginning we made some things wrong .
it was hard for people to give negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their assessments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
&quot; we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other , depending on how much they are about age and place of residence . &quot;
&quot; surprisingly , we trust the people most that are most similar to us . &quot;
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it &apos;s exciting to add a person &apos;s reputation -- in our case by jud@@ gements .
&quot; if you have less than three jud@@ gements , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation bl@@ ends com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little about how to &quot; &quot; Hi &quot; , &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells too much , for example : &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , e.g. &quot; &quot; Great works of art in your apartment ! &quot; &quot; I do with my family vacation . &quot;
how to create it with design to establish this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics one should write something .
our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudi@@ ces against foreigners .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great deal of people who were more than willing to disp@@ lace these prejudi@@ ces .
here you can see how many people claim our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , unbeliev@@ ably good luck . &quot;
&quot; second , the ti@@ rel@@ ess work of our team . &quot;
&quot; thir@@ dly , a need that had not been met before . &quot;
&quot; for us , the business runs very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who were un@@ authorised parties celebrated or apartments rav@@ aged .
hosts have let guests stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
&quot; I stood at the forefront , when confidence was broken . &quot;
there is nothing worse than these calls . it already hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
the disappointment that one hears in the voice of the call@@ ers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve .
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million nights spent there had ever been a problem . &quot;
for men trust each other rightly .
&quot; when trust works , miracles can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood for the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sitting activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are real guar@@ dian angels , who save life , even though they don &apos;t know one properly . &quot;
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they bring books by . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; this is , of course , not possible for every stay . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I first stum@@ bled upon this term , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing work with money transactions ?
it is an economic trade .
&quot; but now simply to call it the &quot; rental industry , &quot; the matter will not be justified . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people put a part of themselves open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; if you are travelling today , fast food is to be compared . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
but what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you visited , a group there would wait to fill one thoroughly and show a quarter of a pub that you have never heard of ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy .
what if we would design apartments from the ground up to one &apos;s share ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would take the thought of joint participation ?
I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of lon@@ eliness and isolation .
&quot; this project has already begun in South Korea &apos;s capital Seoul . many parking spaces belonging to the government , &quot;
&quot; students who were looking for a lead , were offered now . &quot;
&quot; were taught to people whose children were withdrawn . incub@@ ator programs have been launched , &quot;
&quot; to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share economy . through our platform alone , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even host . &quot;
so the idea doesn &apos;t seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we did not invent the wheel .
&quot; hospitality , even before . &quot;
there were similar websites before us .
&quot; so , why did it work ? &quot;
&quot; apart from happiness and timing , we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find it ast@@ ounding , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think about it every time a red Maz@@ da is passing by me .
&quot; of course , we know that design cannot solve every problem . &quot;
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this big influence , I wonder what we can use for design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
perhaps even a sister .
&quot; or supp@@ ressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
this is how the media portra@@ y people who look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show that Americans mean most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t speak with their U@@ ber drivers .
&quot; for those who have never met a Muslim , it &apos;s great to get to know you . &quot;
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a se@@ ag@@ ull @-@ fitness fan@@ atic , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not like Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I was not born that way . &quot;
I decided to do so .
&quot; when I was 17 , I decided to ou@@ st myself . &quot;
&quot; no , not as gay man , like some of my friends , but as Muslims . I decided to wear my hat . &quot;
my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time it was a declaration of independence for me , in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt myself to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I did not only pas@@ sively accept the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , questioned , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
&quot; it was trust and slow devotion , which deep@@ ened with every reading of the Qur &apos;an . &quot;
the beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; have you ever had the feeling that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , understands you completely , and still loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I got married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that aw@@ ful morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast in the end , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; breaking news . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there smoke , aircraft flew in buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock quickly turned into indignation .
why should we do something like that ?
&quot; I changed the television channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists ... &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot; ... &quot;
Oh my God .
&quot; it has not only been attacked by my country , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a suspect . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to drive through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start studying . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I knew -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said : &quot; be watch@@ ful , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Abi@@ de in well lit areas , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t mu@@ zzle you . &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings were l@@ ur@@ king : &quot; &quot; do not go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive coverage .
&quot; understand@@ ably , the feelings were un@@ filtered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims , tear@@ ing down and beating . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I have got the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was also angry .
it is not easy to explain himself constantly .
&quot; I have nothing to ask , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are tough .
&quot; today , we can indeed hear people say , &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of them ? &quot;
some people want to ban Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the USA .
only the question arises : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
you know : a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; like all other Americans , Muslims are not a tumour in the body of the United States , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , educ@@ ators and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closing of mos@@ ques make America safer ?
&quot; there might be a few parking spaces free , but not stop the terror . &quot;
regular visiting of a mosque does help to look more tolerant to people of other fai@@ ths and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington , DC told me recently : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; in the process of radic@@ alization , it has been established that it begins online . as a first , the person is cut off from her church , even from her family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts can make a bra@@ in@@ washing , which causes the person to ab@@ h@@ or the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ ors their behaviour and ideology is a tra@@ itor or by faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we have to stop the people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some still claim that Islam is a non @-@ violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS founded its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , as a human being , I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imag@@ inations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x clan with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology on their &quot; Holy Book . &quot;
&quot; but when you take a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Holy Scriptures . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into Scripture .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she pre@@ tended to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; he said that the problem was just the opposite . every priest with whom she spoke , brought them to silence , and told her that her anger , her sense of injustice in the world , would only bring her into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger , she was a main objective for the instrument@@ alization of extre@@ mi@@ sts who promised her a solution . &quot;
this ima@@ m restored the connection to God and her church .
&quot; instead of acc@@ using her for her anger , he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how the Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect normal Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
&quot; how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day , on our freedom of thought ? &quot;
&quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show , if we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we rather accept an authorit@@ arian system of government , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that if people report messages in which negative reports were reported on Muslims , they rather agree on military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not only an academic problem .
&quot; if you look at when the mood sw@@ ells up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened in the run @-@ up to the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; thus , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society , which has reasonable and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the assignment of collective guilt , it is not just about having to explain oneself . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was at the dental faculty , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous man whom she knew . &quot;
&quot; she visited him there , and he showed her his CV . she was amazed and said : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; when did such an accomplished young man come from my brother ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; just a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and his wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just like the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an who was visiting in the afternoon . &quot;
he shot eight times on De@@ ah .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also deadly .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us by fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we chose the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the children &apos;s seat , we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , drew my shoes , went into the hall of prayer , and what I saw let me stop . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , because half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at that moment I collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had encouraged the courage and compassion of panic and prejudi@@ ces .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
are you going to be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than those .
thank you .
thank you very much !
&quot; Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia , you seem to have hit a nerve . &quot;
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who may claim that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble mind factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , don &apos;t be deceived . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as ordinary as it is allowed .
&quot; when you look at Muslims around the world , and I did that with the largest ever conducted study on Muslims around the world , people want ordinary things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I am not an exception in any way .
&quot; when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken , and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what began as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ on@@ aire business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the potential applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research institutions all over the world . &quot;
&quot; before air p@@ otion penet@@ rated into our social consciousness , an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRA@@ C Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience . some years ago they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting to each other , flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tigh@@ test space . &quot;
you can also build independently tigh@@ tening structures .
&quot; they have learned to carry loads , deal with tur@@ mo@@ il and generally react to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our aim is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to function autonom@@ ously , it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the space . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects , which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
&quot; each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room , determine calculations on board what the machine should do . &quot;
&quot; external commands exist on the highest level . for example , &quot; &quot; Start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called stern starter , &quot;
a flight device that tries to beat two flies with one flap .
&quot; like other star@@ ters , it is efficient in the forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most star@@ ters , it can float , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of rear star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ences such as wind gu@@ sts .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask basic abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter . &quot;
one such question would be : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ?
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts , which get together to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled flying devices , which only had two movable parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with just one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simplest remote controlled aircraft . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one movable part , one prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and cross@@ ru@@ des , no other actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , inside life very much happens so that it can fly steady and move in space everywhere . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear @-@ star@@ ters . to bring it to flying , I have to throw it exactly right . &quot;
&quot; the probability of watching it right is low , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the Mon@@ osp@@ inner is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the coach with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is not symmet@@ rical .
&quot; therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in its alignment . &quot;
&quot; as a result , it receives the most out @-@ of @-@ the @-@ ordinary skill , &quot;
&quot; moving in space in all directions , no matter what direction it is turned or even how it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; some models can be seen in models , the rest is learned directly from flying . &quot;
let us look at that .
&quot; when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely safe and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; when you build them together , they behave like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; however , something goes wrong -- an engine or prop@@ eller falls off , the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further , albeit limited . &quot;
we will now demonstrate this by making a half f@@ light@@ less .
the last demonstration examined synthetic heat .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took commercial micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where space is and is self @-@ controlled . therefore there is no upper limit .
hopefully these demonstrations motiv@@ ate you to think of new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; the particularly safe machine there , on Broadway , wants to become a flying lamp@@ shade . &quot;
of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology .
&quot; for guys like us , wages are in development and act of creation . &quot;
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and magical our universe is , and that there are creative , clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very distant gal@@ axy , so the mass of three suns moved into pure energy in a tenth of a second . &quot;
&quot; for this short moment , they lit up bri@@ ghter than all the stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not release their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the entire energy was handed over to the space @-@ time structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
&quot; at first , we arrange the events in time . &quot;
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , multi@@ cellular life was created on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Earth has brought forth a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands at us at -- even the Internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of especially courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver of Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector , to search for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which arise through col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them thought they were crazy .
&quot; but enough people recognised them as crazy geni@@ uses , so that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea . &quot;
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the Laser Inter@@ fer@@ ometer Gra@@ vity Observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o increased considerably , which greatly improved recognition performance . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is called Advanced Lig@@ o . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last trial in order to clarify some minor , stub@@ born problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , only a few days after the detector &apos;s start @-@ up , the gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes conveyed through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and through the detector as well .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the Bir@@ th of my Dau@@ ghter
and the departure from my to@@ dd@@ ler father .
basically they were the fruits of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves of black holes and her by observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational wave is a cra@@ cking in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when dra@@ gging the shaft , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and st@@ amped into the other . &quot;
&quot; for illustr@@ ative , lec@@ turers in courses for rel@@ ativity @-@ theory often lead to a really al@@ ber@@ y dance . &quot;
&quot; stretching and du@@ sting , stretching and du@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , for example , each of us was stretched and st@@ alled by us when hitting the waves . the el@@ ong@@ ation of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that is 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre @-@ long laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be accurately measured on less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of a nuclear nucleus . that &apos;s gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in the construction of such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
&quot; but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public , all obstacles will certainly be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to claim that Lig@@ o is more of an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points . &quot;
with sounds this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; that is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
about your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead we listen to certain qualities such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now , just Alice speaks . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts them . &quot;
&quot; drummer Bob . &quot;
the same applies to gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make simple images of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o the measured frequencies are in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe . &quot;
&quot; listening to the gra@@ vit@@ ation can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes , with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time . &quot;
SH : two black non @-@ rotating holes simply : w@@ up@@ p !
&quot; if the two bodies rotate very quickly , one hears the same p@@ ant@@ y with an additional key change . that sounds like : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , im@@ printed in the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- No one who knows what to hear will recognize this as sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold sun mass each , which rotate around as quickly as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let us consider briefly what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve around one hundred times a second before col@@ li@@ ding . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know of it because we &apos;ve heard it .
therein lies the lasting meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o p@@ aves a whole new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before .
&quot; on this way , we can listen to the space and hear the invisible . &quot;
we can &apos;t see much in space -- practical or basically -- not .
&quot; Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in super @-@ nov@@ as . &quot;
they are very useful . we have learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes occur in the core , hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never see through since these op@@ aque are .
&quot; the Big B@@ ang : I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see it as the Big B@@ ang is covered by its own after@@ glow . &quot;
&quot; using gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves , it should be possible to look back to the beginning . &quot;
&quot; and the most important thing : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says on this subject : me : the kind of stars that cause black holes , as Lig@@ o sees them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; they are enormous , ancient bodies of prehistoric times . the black holes are so to say the sour bones for our arch@@ eological work . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a completely different point of view of the events happening in space , on the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now is to be as bold as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on Earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than to listen to the Big B@@ ang itself ?
now is the time of great dreams .
you can dream with us .
thank you .
some time ago I tried an experiment .
&quot; for one year , I would say &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to all that I was afraid of . &quot;
&quot; whether it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; yes . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start playing with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what I was afraid of , eliminated my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep speeches , my social fear -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes &quot; changed me .
but there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected way . it started with a question of my little ones .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my beak @-@ cup . &quot;
&quot; she asked her once , if I could play with her when I was just on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this Yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on I swear to always play with them whenever you ask me to do so . no matter what I &apos;m doing or where I go , I always say yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magic effect on me , on my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I fully understood that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; say to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
&quot; I am a writer . I think things , aw@@ aken you to life . &quot;
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
&quot; I do television , in a great style . &quot;
in this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days four shows , so all nine days 20 million dollars television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three programmes simultaneously in production , once four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : how To Get A@@ way With Mur@@ der , 10 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours TV &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
&quot; in America , my TV series are running each other on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself and not only produced , so still above . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around camp@@ fires and tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fire burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who still does it ?
&quot; no one , therefore I &apos;m a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company , a country or a classroom , a business or a household , take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I don &apos;t just mess around the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it &apos;s true when I say : I understand that it does not dream about dreaming . &quot;
&quot; it is all a job , all work , everything , everything blood , everything sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m immersed in my work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a land out of nothing .
&quot; it is like I set up troops , when I painted on a canvas . &quot;
&quot; so as to carry a high note , deliver a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all that at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; she is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and reasonable . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
&quot; a bu@@ zz begins in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like an animated street , I could drive on it forever . &quot;
many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I talk over writing that writing gives me joy .
&quot; don &apos;t understand me wrong , that &apos;s what it does . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I began working with TV production , when I began to work and work and work , build , create and work together , I discovered this thing , this hum@@ ming , this energy . &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the sums are action and activity . the sums are a drug .
the sums are music . the sums are light and air .
the sums are God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such a sum , then you cannot strive differently than by size . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of not being different than aiming for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called the sums .
or maybe it also means to be a work@@ ah@@ olic .
perhaps it is called genius .
perhaps ego is called ego .
perhaps it is the fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I just know I &apos;m not made for failure , and I just know that I love the sums . &quot;
I just want to tell you that I &apos;m a Titan and I know I don &apos;t want to question it .
&quot; the more successful I become , the more broad@@ casts , the more episodes , the more work there is , the more work , the more I write history , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what do I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the army , the canvas , the high sound , the sums , the tot@@ als , the tot@@ als . &quot;
I like this sum . I love the sums .
I need the sums . I am the sums .
am I just this hum@@ ming ?
and then the sums stopped .
&quot; over@@ hau@@ led , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burned out . &quot;
the tot@@ als stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single job .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; &quot; my m@@ um won &apos;t be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ land . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 when sum@@ mon@@ ing was heard . &quot;
the tot@@ als of the engine stopped .
I didn &apos;t love my work any more . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my sum@@ p was broken .
&quot; I made the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing to deleg@@ ate , a titanium is not asleep , does not give up , with whol@@ eh@@ ear@@ t@@ edly , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a showcase Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I just had no fun anymore . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the hum@@ ming and the sums I was .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; Get out , stupid author @-@ Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do it , you work , you love what you do to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker to be a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , one simply loves another and that gives one the sum if you know the sum , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; if the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I am on the way to the outside , late on it and she says , &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say no when two things become aware of me :
&quot; first , I have to say yes to all and secondly , she did not call me &quot; et@@ ching . &quot; &quot;
she calls no more &quot; et@@ ching . &quot;
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I &apos;m Titan and my tot@@ als smo@@ g , and here everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ om , do you like to play ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding , because my pain and my panic , in lon@@ eliness and in the absence of the sum , I can &apos;t do anything except to watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am silent .
&quot; the land I create , the marathon which I run , the army , the screen , the high sound - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; all that exists are sti@@ cky finger and wet kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it is about letting go , or whatever the girl lets in &quot; The Ice Queen . &quot; &quot;
peace and simplicity are everywhere .
the air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something inside me sol@@ ves .
a mental door opens and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that not immediately , but it happens it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming is slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel like I would know a magical mystery .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the sums of money , this is only the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , when I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and TV hours and how function@@ ally my brain is , then I forgot what the real sum is . &quot;
the sums are not a force and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sums depend on love .
the sum is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; real sums ignore the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real bu@@ zz is simple and original .
&quot; the real sum is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered the wrong words to me , for which God told me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is simply love .
&quot; we all need a little more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wishes to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic from any guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not just like working .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like playing it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer at work than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what kind of man works better than being at home ? &quot;
&quot; well , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I &apos;m too relaxed is none of it .
&quot; we ra@@ ve around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we do small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we burst soap bubbles .
&quot; I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always grab on my phone .
but it is OK .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the tot@@ als of the universe comp@@ lies me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
&quot; you can do it too ! always say yes , if your child wants to play with you . &quot;
&quot; perhaps keep me na@@ ï@@ ve , for a day@@ dream . &quot;
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they are not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et show figure .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
there are only 15 minutes .
my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else .
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bird or bis@@ cuit is replaced .
&quot; and talking to my teen@@ age daughter for 15 minutes , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; it is only 15 minutes , there is no need for it . &quot;
&quot; each can take 15 minutes , even on a bad mood ! &quot;
15 minutes a piece !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children get ready . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . it does not have to be the children . it is important to feel the hum@@ ming , to have a place for his peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about pleasure , &quot;
&quot; in order to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to 15 minutes !
find out what you are doing well .
find out and keep it out .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I will fail and I won . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes on the track why not allow for full 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong about it ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seem to return if I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the sums , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I am not the sums , the sums are not me ... no more . &quot;
soap bubbles and sti@@ cky hands . dinner with friends .
this is my sum .
the tot@@ als of life .
the tot@@ ality of love .
&quot; the sums of work is part of me , but just a part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that . &quot;
I don &apos;t know that I &apos;m a Titan . I &apos;ve never seen a Titan that plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire still burns .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the sums . the land I create , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high sound , the tot@@ um , the sums , the other , the right sum : the tot@@ als of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this hum@@ ming , the more this unusual , consistent , bare and new feeling of life is wide within me . less titanium - more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel exactly this hum@@ ming , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am a writer . I think about things , I aw@@ aken you to life . &quot;
&quot; that is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
like most of my colleagues I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day .
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons , it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent disability . &quot;
that is the reason why I became functional neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions .
&quot; certainly , they have heard of one of the best known , the &quot; &quot; depth cereb@@ ral stimulation . &quot; &quot; an electrode is im@@ planted deep in the brain to influence the neur@@ ons in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function is improved . &quot;
it is truly an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ bling and severe pain .
&quot; however , neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro healing . &quot;
the dream of functional neuro@@ sur@@ geons is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to it .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
at that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room .
often I provided patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
&quot; you have to imagine that the brain is s@@ wollen with cran@@ ium cereb@@ ral trau@@ mas , and the cran@@ ial pressure increases . &quot;
&quot; to save life , you have to reduce the cran@@ ial pressure . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part of a s@@ wollen brain compound .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues , a bi@@ ologist . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children , which are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find proper nutrition , temperature , humidity and environments to thri@@ ve . &quot;
this is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
after many attempts it made Jean @-@ François .
this he saw under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked like a stem cell culture . with large green cells , which are surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; you may already know from biology class that stem cells are im@@ mature cells , which can turn into any cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room .
we did another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new , strange cell population which looked like stem cells but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed a long time to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
at the stage of the fet@@ us they care for the folding of the brain .
but why are they staying for us ?
we do not know this .
&quot; we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain , as we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
&quot; one thing , however , is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells . &quot;
we are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean @-@ François did .
and then mark them in color in order to be able to track them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we re @-@ planted them at the birth of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- Aut@@ ot@@ ran@@ splan@@ tation .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re @-@ implant these cells into normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re @-@ implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler we were able to work with apes .
&quot; in the first scenario we re @-@ planted the cells into a healthy brain , and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed , so they disappear . &quot;
in the second scenario we added a violation and re @-@ planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons .
here you can see what we were able to observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that were re @-@ planted .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells , which we dy@@ e in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets from a tray .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable skill level , we last in the motor cor@@ tex the hand motor range . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; patients are paraly@@ sed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to some extent , just like with the monkey . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous relaxation , we im@@ planted its own cells . &quot;
&quot; on the left you see the monkey , who spontaneously recovered . &quot;
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from prior to injury .
it is not as precise and not so fast .
&quot; now see when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the implantation . &quot;
I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us .
&quot; since that time , we have found a lot more about these cells . &quot;
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use it in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ itate her with man .
I really hope to show you soon how the human brain gives us the means to heal itself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , perhaps even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can do that . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings . &quot;
Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies .
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it takes before someone can enter the hospital and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : that &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical study . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to start it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment .
&quot; after that , it is necessary to apply this to a multi@@ center study . &quot;
you must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course .
&quot; we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to look at them as imm@@ utable in@@ difference .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
that is not true .
Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great im@@ it@@ ators in Beijing proved dou@@ bt@@ less that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely un@@ democratic .
&quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was un@@ equi@@ vo@@ cally clear to me as the finance minister in the Euro@@ group that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programmes that were implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment , I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my rebel@@ li@@ ous friends , who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present an economic model for real democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China , and even the Euro@@ group succ@@ um@@ b to a mistake , we could save ourselves democracy , but that we need a true and def@@ en@@ sible democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies are becoming bri@@ ghter , our future glo@@ omy , and our great , new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the topic of extravag@@ ance , I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction which currently threat@@ ens our economies . &quot;
I call it the &quot; Twin Summit Par@@ ad@@ ox . &quot;
&quot; a summit is known to you . you know and recognize it as the debt mountain , which throws its long shadows over the USA , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the debt mountain , &quot;
but few recognize his twin .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy depos@@ itors and corporations , which , however , are too fear@@ ful to invest there where it would be productive and contribute income with which you can carry out the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; in the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in the United States , England and the Eurozone , in all the wealth producing goods , such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; $ 3.@@ 4 Bil@@ lion US dollar is looking for a lot of money until one compar@@ es it with the 5.@@ 1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate except the stock exchanges and ex@@ hu@@ ffle the real estate prices . &quot;
thus debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin peaks which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms .
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ olds in the USA , Japan and Europe unemployed , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , as in a final loop , strengthens the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors who , fear@@ ing the prophecy of the ro@@ ok@@ er , could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up , &quot;
un@@ intentionally bring about the circumstances that cause O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
that is my hair with capitalism --
&quot; his exceedingly lav@@ ish art . all the un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
&quot; but before we continue , what do we mean by democracy ? &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government .
&quot; of course , Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy closed too many -- &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
&quot; however , it would be a mistake to dimin@@ ish the significance of Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy because of these exclu@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; the decisive part of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it with@@ drew the working poor , and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which allowed them to give them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same voice wei@@ ghting in questions of the state of state . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle , which shines brigh@@ tly , it is also burnt out quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , our present @-@ day liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies did not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in the Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which in the end was a statute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two took place , gradually under@@ mining politics and escap@@ es them . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before ?
it is not up to a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because the government can now be in the government and still not in power , because the power of politics is mig@@ rated into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my Ha@@ des with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it &apos;s about like a herd of car@@ ni@@ vor@@ es who sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which they nour@@ ished , that they are star@@ ving at the end . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has har@@ med politics so far that it har@@ ms itself by the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of corporations is growing , political goods are de@@ valued , inequality rises , the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too sc@@ ared to invest the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demos &quot; from democracy , the higher the twin peaks , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy again , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; keeps control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look very well .
the doctrine of the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor recover only through a miracle a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brut@@ ality and waste .
but there is one solution : to abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers through automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste of sub@@ lime , and the social conflicts deeper , just as it -- very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come . &quot;
&quot; so we must transform the economy and re@@ unite the fields of business and politics , and make sure that we democr@@ ati@@ ze the re@@ unified area , otherwise we end up in a disease monitoring hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; appear like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced . &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie similar to that in &quot; matrix , &quot; or by something similar to the society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; or in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a , &quot; in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life . &quot;
I think we can be optimistic .
&quot; so what would it be , how could it look like this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; -@@ like d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ? &quot;
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in a nut@@ shell . &quot;
&quot; in the business area : please imagine a capital market where you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from one work@@ station to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company . &quot;
&quot; then all income from capital and revenue came from , and the concept of wage labor is completely obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the enterprises , but they do not work in it , and employees who work there , which the company does not belong to . no exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no rising twin summit . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy , please briefly introduce our national currencies to have a freely fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency backed by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the entire world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country , into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund inv@@ ests in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today , we have them , in particular against the background of a re@@ united policy and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal in which she prefers privileged people , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because it is buried in the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global key@@ n@@ esi@@ anische . &quot;
&quot; but above all , it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy . &quot;
we will wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we choose politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democratic . &quot;
thank you .
&quot; father Giussani : &quot; &quot; Yan@@ is ... &quot; &quot; &quot;
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if any of what I just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers calls &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next , as we currently experience it , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies , but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is true , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; like Ha@@ ye@@ k , therefore I am a liber@@ t@@ arian Marxist , and like Key@@ nes , and that &apos;s why I am also perfect . &quot;
&quot; BG : indeed , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : it &apos;s a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said that . BG : in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view to China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
&quot; in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies , we have the appearance of democracy . &quot;
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in some ways , if I can say this pro@@ voc@@ ative , China is similar to the 19th century England . &quot;
because -- remember -- we tend to connect liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake .
&quot; liber@@ alism , Liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what one can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , especially the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to now repro@@ ach China to do what the West has done in the 19th century , smells of hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
&quot; BG : I am sure , that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Minister of Finance of Greece at the beginning of the year . &quot;
Y@@ V : I guess that is coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half @-@ year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the Eurozone , &quot;
&quot; to say good @-@ bye to the self @-@ compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the continuous denial that a massive destruction line passed through the euro@@ zone , and continues to spread massi@@ vely to the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the Euro zone , continued to accept denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience of the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism , you might have to delay it for a while , but when the change occurs , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you think ahead ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future , if we do not change its structure . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
&quot; BG : for example , Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Ern@@ sth@@ aft ... &quot;
&quot; if there is a Minister of Finance , or any Minister , who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , asser@@ ts that he did not make any mistakes , then this is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the sides of the financi@@ ers to find a common solution .
but that was not .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions that ran through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that for 5 years they had been carrying out a cat@@ astrop@@ hic programme in Greece .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
this is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , stood : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive tone of talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the euro@@ zone comes from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my biggest fear is that the Eurozone did not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the exposed tile forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to strike the path of a post@@ modern 1930 , what it appears to me , it will be equally detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans as well as the non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope you &apos;ll be wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for being with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thanks .
&quot; Roy Price has never heard most of the most , although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19th April 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for many of you .
that goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago .
Roy Price is senior manager at Amazon Studios
the Amazon TV production company .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an I@@ gel@@ fr@@ is@@ ur and describes himself on Twitter as &quot; films , TV , technology , tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for picking up the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV shows that Roy can &apos;t choose any one .
&quot; he must find shows , which are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve . &quot;
&quot; this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating . &quot;
&quot; if your show is valued at nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ tive , where , after watching a relay , your brain asks : &quot; where are more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
Roy Price doesn &apos;t worry about getting to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to support &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as . &quot;
&quot; he makes more thoughts about the average balance , the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t delight . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it &apos;s the first time that Amazon is doing something , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create successes .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he holds a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and sel@@ ects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where everyone can watch them for free . &quot;
&quot; and if Amazon comes out for nothing , it &apos;s up to you , right ? &quot;
millions of spectators are watching these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows . &quot;
you are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you can capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you jump over or look again . &quot;
they collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process these and hence the answer , and this is : &quot; &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com about four republi@@ can U.S. sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anyone know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show , because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it is just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy , he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it , but he does it differently . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a competition , he and his team looked at the existing data on Net@@ fli@@ x Viewer , so the reviews they give to the shows , their course , which shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : which shows they like , which producers , what actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the pieces together , they entered a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a sen@@ ator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 review on this curve .
&quot; of course , the question is : what happened here ? &quot;
&quot; there are two very competitive , data @-@ sealed firms . &quot;
&quot; they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is this ?
because logic somehow states that it should work in everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you meet , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis doesn &apos;t work , then this is a bit sc@@ ary because we live in a time in which we live more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the Multi @-@ Health System here ?
&quot; no one . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software . come into contact with it you are in prison .
&quot; if someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for release , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it is decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always the best results are generated . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
even the data of experienced companies are sometimes wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can fores@@ ee due to data analysis out@@ breaks of influenza , the bad kind of predic@@ tions -- by data analysis of Google &apos;s research . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation . the success culmin@@ ated in a release in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly , year by year , until it suddenly didn &apos;t work anymore , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of the publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; in spite of all these mistakes , data flow into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the legal implementation , in medicine . &quot;
so we should rather make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use uni@@ mag@@ in@@ ably many data to make serious decisions , as the decision for cancer therapy &quot;
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognised some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; if you have to solve a complex problem , you mainly do two things : &quot;
&quot; first , put this problem into its parts so you can analyze the items ; as a branch you put the items together to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things to take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are only good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help disman@@ tle a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision .
for this there is another tool and we all have it all : our brain .
&quot; when there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful , because they used data and understanding where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audiences , which they would otherwise not have been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; did not stand in the data . &quot;
&quot; T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team made this decision for this show , which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision . &quot;
&quot; Amazon , on the other hand , did this in the wrong way . &quot;
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions , first as they vie for TV ideas , then chose &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they could always say : &quot; that &apos;s what the data say to us . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data is just a tool , and in order not to forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was any data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
it is also called &quot; Magic 8 Ball . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a Ja@@ - or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; most likely &quot; -- right here at this moment .
I will f@@ use it later with a technical demo .
&quot; so far I have made some decisions in my life so far , whereby I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight . &quot;
&quot; but , as you know , of course , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn . &quot;
&quot; and I received this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data , it still pays off making decisions to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks . &quot;
&quot; in the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
