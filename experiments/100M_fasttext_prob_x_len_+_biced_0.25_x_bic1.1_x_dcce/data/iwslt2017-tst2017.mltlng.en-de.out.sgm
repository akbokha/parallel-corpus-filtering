<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">They might know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before someone had heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA was illegal telephones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter that should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this, he describes a catastrophic U.S. intelligence operation in which the CIA sent Iran literally blueprints for a nuclear bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who didn't like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and called upon him to name his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol of the government's pattern to condemn whistleblowers and spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the first constitutional complaint, the media have the right to publish covert information."</seg>
<seg id="13">"but it is impossible to apply this right if media does not get this information, and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they reveal."</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government leaning against Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters were doing before him: he refused and said he would rather go to jail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen lived with the risk of going into prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the process, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, although for years that it would be essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped against orphans."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic monitoring the reporters and sources can always hide less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of retiring and raising money, this could also carry out his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, secretly concerned his telephone conversation,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"as well as his e-mail data, financial and bank information, his credit, and even travel notes with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence that they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA whistleblower and risens alleged source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblowers, but instead, the judiciary condemns more than all U.S. governments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security has been the result of a whistleblower to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first Constitutional Court, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government allows the government to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect their sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and indeed, they can do that from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software that didn't exist when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"one such technology is SecureDrop, an open source covering system for whistleblowers, originally developed by the internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation in which I work."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an e-mail, go to a news site like that of the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload documents or send information, as with any regular contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">These are then encrypted and stored on a server to which only the respective news agency has access.</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government cannot obtain more information secretly, and many of the information they would like would not be available from the start."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect the freedom of the press in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spionage technologies that jeopardize us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important for us to ensure that not only technologists such as Edward Snowden have the possibility of bringing misdeeds. it is equally important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the next environmental worker who alerts the alarm to the contaminated water of Flint. or a wall street insider who warns us before the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose the crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[on 3 April 2016 the biggest data leak of history was published.] [the "Panama Papers" revealed that rich and mighty] [huge sums of money have been hidden in tax havens] [what does that mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.]</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies such as Mossack Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up this? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, as the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has already resulted in very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">Iceland's Prime Minister has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has stamp companies in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a track of $2 billion leads to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who are waiting nervously for the next release, and the next documents revealed."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now that sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems weep away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should that happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their assets in tax havens and not to pay all their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world, media and leading politicians, like secret tax havens, will be used to hide and obscure their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and revealing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people this whole world seems very confusing, and it's hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a matryoff capsule.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind these structures."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what matters."</seg>
<seg id="62">I think it is also interesting that there are fewer reports about this matter in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="63">"presumably because there were so far no prominent Americans, who came to this scandal in these revelations."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans who hide their fortunes in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"however, by the principle that these tax havens function, Mossack Fonseca has fewer American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leak from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see much more cases and examples that have connections to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, in some U.S. states you need less information, less information must be given to form a company than to get a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This kind of intransparency in the US has allowed employees of school districts to rip off school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Scammers have allowed scammers to rip off particularly vulnerable offsprings.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks like in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator to the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator turned out to be an African minister, who wanted to bring suspicious money to the US to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked that all of us made suggestions for a lawyer to our investigator how he could transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as a client, and of course nobody was given money. but it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not about a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our hidden investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">"it is not about a single leading politician, involved in a scandal."</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and to cope with this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this kind of behavior more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very melancholy as if we could do nothing about it, as if nothing had ever changed; as if there is always the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">But as a born optimist I see quite well that a lot has started to change.</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the past few years, we have seen incidents towards more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The theme took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in 2013 in Northern Ireland.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has registered in central registers on a national level who really is behind companies in Europe and who controls them."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced a bill in both parliamentary groups, but this does not make the progress we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge glimpse into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who become angry when they see how other people can hide their true identity behind fake companies.</seg>
<seg id="93">"we need leaders in the economy, who get up and say:" transparency is not good for business. ""</seg>
<seg id="94">We need leading politicians who recognize the problem and use laws to end this kind of intransparency.</seg>
<seg id="95">"together we can finally end the intransparency, which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">This is the story of how I almost abducted and landed in the trunk of a red Mazda.</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a backyard sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my stuff.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip through the whole country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I was tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" where do you sleep tonight? "</seg>
<seg id="104">He made the whole thing worse: "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," Oh, man! "</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who does not know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the corps of peace, but I don't know if he really plans it. I don't want to be kidnapped in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small luggage space!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Whom, please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what did I get into it?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I got out of bed, slept on toes at the door, and my bedroom door closed."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not mad at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me hangs today in his classroom. he is now a teacher.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me in childhood were actually friends who were only waiting to be discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's take a time leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost bankrupt, my roommate pulls out and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think creativity can create it, turn fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and established so "air mattress and breakfast" [AIRB aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three happy guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on a wooden floor.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it great and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">"I am sure, our cheese ham omelets tasted completely different because we made it for our guests."</seg>
<seg id="133">"when we passed our last guest and dropped the door into the castle, Brian and I started."</seg>
<seg id="134">Have we just discovered that we found new friends at the same time and could pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things came into the roll.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if you could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"this is how we presented to the investors:" we would like to create a website where people publicly post pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the kind of rooms whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the internet, they can invite other people to stay overnight."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the rocket to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they did not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"no one, who is still in comfort, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because as children we all learned that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you look at the things you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create an immense trust through design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design make something like that?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of what degree of trust we aimed at.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-seconds experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone out.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into the hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I would like to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Enter your unlocked cell phone from your left seat neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This quiet plowing of panic you feel now -- is exactly what hosts feel when opening the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read your SMS, they see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most people feel the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">This is how most guests feel when they stay somewhere else.</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason can our company exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like that, who actually has Al Gores Handy?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you tell on Twitter that he is channeled to the Office of the President?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the cell phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I would like to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had first introduced himself with his name; if he had told whence he came from, how his dog or his children were called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you had 150 assessments that all say: "he can really hold on very well sprung cellphones!</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to hand over your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">Because a well-thought out feedback system reinforces the trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">In the beginning we made some things wrong.</seg>
<seg id="174">It was hard for people to give negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait until both host and guest had given their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">"we conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other, depending on how much they are about age and place of residence."</seg>
<seg id="178">"surprisingly, we trust the people most that are most similar to us."</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It's exciting to add a person's reputation -- in our case by judgements.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if you have less than three judgements, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation blends commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deeply rooted preference.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little about how to" "Hi", "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells too much, for example:" I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, e.g." "Great works of art in your apartment!" "I do with my family vacation."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design to establish this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics one should write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our entire company builds on the hope that the right design can help overcome our prejudices against foreigners.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great deal of people who were more than willing to displace these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you can see how many people claim our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, unbelievably good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">"second, the tireless work of our team."</seg>
<seg id="199">"thirdly, a need that had not been met before."</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business runs very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were unauthorised parties celebrated or apartments ravaged.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have let guests stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in the customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">"I stood at the forefront, when confidence was broken."</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it already hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">The disappointment that one hears in the voice of the callers was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve.</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million nights spent there had ever been a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For men trust each other rightly.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, miracles can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood for the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect home for travelers who tend to heart attacks because of sitting activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are real guardian angels, who save life, even though they don't know one properly."</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they bring books by."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"this is, of course, not possible for every stay."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I first stumbled upon this term, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing work with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now simply to call it the" rental industry, "the matter will not be justified."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people put a part of themselves open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"if you are travelling today, fast food is to be compared. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">But what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you visited, a group there would wait to fill one thoroughly and show a quarter of a pub that you have never heard of;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">Nowadays apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy.</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would design apartments from the ground up to one's share?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would take the thought of joint participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">I imagine cities that enable us society and relationships instead of loneliness and isolation.</seg>
<seg id="239">"this project has already begun in South Korea's capital Seoul. many parking spaces belonging to the government,"</seg>
<seg id="240">"students who were looking for a lead, were offered now."</seg>
<seg id="241">"were taught to people whose children were withdrawn. incubator programs have been launched,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"to finance new start-ups in the Share economy. through our platform alone, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be a guest at a stranger or even host."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea doesn't seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We did not invent the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">"hospitality, even before."</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">"so, why did it work?"</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from happiness and timing, we noticed that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find it astounding,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think about it every time a red Mazda is passing by me.</seg>
<seg id="253">"of course, we know that design cannot solve every problem."</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this big influence, I wonder what we can use for design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Perhaps even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or suppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">This is how the media portray people who look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting on Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show that Americans mean most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't speak with their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">"for those who have never met a Muslim, it's great to get to know you."</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a seagull-fitness fanatic,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not like Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I was not born that way."</seg>
<seg id="274">I decided to do so.</seg>
<seg id="275">"when I was 17, I decided to oust myself."</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as gay man, like some of my friends, but as Muslims. I decided to wear my hat."</seg>
<seg id="277">My feminist friends were horrified: "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time it was a declaration of independence for me, in contrast to the pressure I felt as 17-year-old to adapt myself to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I did not only passively accept the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, questioned, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">"it was trust and slow devotion, which deepened with every reading of the Qur'an."</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes makes me cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"have you ever had the feeling that someone perceives you, understands you completely, and still loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I got married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that awful morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast in the end, looked at the screen and saw the word" breaking news. ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there smoke, aircraft flew in buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock quickly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I changed the television channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists..."... "in the name of Islam..."... "..."... "..."... "..."</seg>
<seg id="300">Oh my God.</seg>
<seg id="301">"it has not only been attacked by my country, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspect."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to drive through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start studying."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I knew -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I was the first time I was afraid to be recognized as Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations that said:" be watchful, "" Be careful, "" Abide in well lit areas, "" Don't muzzle you. "</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day when Muslims gather for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings were lurking:" "do not go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive coverage.</seg>
<seg id="310">"understandably, the feelings were unfiltered and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or from people that were held for Muslims, tearing down and beating."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I have got the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was also angry.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to explain himself constantly.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing to ask, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are tough.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can indeed hear people say," There is a problem in this country -- it is Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them? "</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to ban Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">Only the question arises: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">You know: a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"like all other Americans, Muslims are not a tumour in the body of the United States, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, educators and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closing of mosques make America safer?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there might be a few parking spaces free, but not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visiting of a mosque does help to look more tolerant to people of other faiths and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the area of Washington, DC told me recently: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"in the process of radicalization, it has been established that it begins online. as a first, the person is cut off from her church, even from her family, so that the extremists can make a brainwashing, which causes the person to abhor the true Muslims, and anyone who abhors their behaviour and ideology is a traitor or by faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we have to stop the people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some still claim that Islam is a non-violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS founded its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, as a human being, I think we have to do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations if one recognizes them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux clan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology on their "Holy Book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but when you take a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Holy Scriptures. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into Scripture.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she pretended to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"he said that the problem was just the opposite. every priest with whom she spoke, brought them to silence, and told her that her anger, her sense of injustice in the world, would only bring her into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would make sense to her anger, she was a main objective for the instrumentalization of extremists who promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This imam restored the connection to God and her church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of accusing her for her anger, he showed her constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how the Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect normal Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">"how does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day, on our freedom of thought?"</seg>
<seg id="358">"one study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show, if we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we rather accept an authoritarian system of government, conformity and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that if people report messages in which negative reports were reported on Muslims, they rather agree on military attacks on Muslim countries and the circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not only an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"if you look at when the mood swells up against Muslims -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened in the run-up to the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"thus, Islamophobia is not simply the natural reaction to Muslim terror as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public to undermine the foundation of a free society, which has reasonable and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"in the case of the assignment of collective guilt, it is not just about having to explain oneself."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was at the dental faculty, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous man whom she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">"she visited him there, and he showed her his CV. she was amazed and said:"</seg>
<seg id="374">"" "when did such an accomplished young man come from my brother?" ""</seg>
<seg id="375">"just a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and his wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just like the sister of Yusor, Razan who was visiting in the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot eight times on Deah.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also deadly.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or were we safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us by fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We chose the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the children's seat, we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, drew my shoes, went into the hall of prayer, and what I saw let me stop."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, because half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At that moment I collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had encouraged the courage and compassion of panic and prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Are you going to be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than those.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">"Helen Walters: so Dalia, you seem to have hit a nerve."</seg>
<seg id="396">"but I wonder what you say to those who may claim that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a noble mind factory, so an exception and not the rule."</seg>

<seg id="407">What began as a platform for hobbyists is about to become a billionaire business.</seg>
<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the potential applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research institutions all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air potion penetrated into our social consciousness, an autonomous fleet of aircraft at the FRAC Centre in France built a six meter high tower from 1 500 bricks in front of the audience. some years ago they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting to each other, flight devices reach high speed and acceleration in the tightest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build independently tightening structures.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to carry loads, deal with turmoil and generally react to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our aim is to cross the limits of what is possible in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to function autonomously, it is necessary to know collectively where the mobile objects are located in the space."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects, which enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">"each aircraft has internal sensors to determine the position in the room, determine calculations on board what the machine should do."</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands exist on the highest level. for example," "Start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called stern starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device that tries to beat two flies with one flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starters, it is efficient in the forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most starters, it can float, and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of rear starters is that they react sensitively to turbulences such as wind gusts.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind it is that the aircraft no matter which position the optimal position can be recovered and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask basic abstract questions that are at the heart of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">One such question would be: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with a thousand moving parts, which get together to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote controlled flying devices, which only had two movable parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with just one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanically simplest remote controlled aircraft. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one movable part, one propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and crossrudes, no other actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, inside life very much happens so that it can fly steady and move in space everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the rear-starters. to bring it to flying, I have to throw it exactly right."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the probability of watching it right is low, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the Monospinner is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the coach with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is not symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">"therefore, it is ambivalent in its alignment."</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, it receives the most out-of-the-ordinary skill,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in space in all directions, no matter what direction it is turned or even how it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers of the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"some models can be seen in models, the rest is learned directly from flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let us look at that.</seg>
<seg id="451">"when flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely safe and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"when you build them together, they behave like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"however, something goes wrong -- an engine or propeller falls off, the electronics or a battery -- the machine can fly further, albeit limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will now demonstrate this by making a half flightless.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration examined synthetic heat.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units allows a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took commercial micro-quadcopter -- each one weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip them with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where space is and is self-controlled. therefore there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully these demonstrations motivate you to think of new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">"the particularly safe machine there, on Broadway, wants to become a flying lampshade."</seg>
<seg id="464">Of course it is difficult to predict the influence of this technology.</seg>
<seg id="465">"for guys like us, wages are in development and act of creation."</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and magical our universe is, and that there are creative, clever creatures allowed to form them in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very distant galaxy, so the mass of three suns moved into pure energy in a tenth of a second."</seg>
<seg id="470">"for this short moment, they lit up brighter than all the stars in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not release their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The entire energy was handed over to the space-time structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">"at first, we arrange the events in time."</seg>
<seg id="476">"1.3 billion years ago, multicellular life was created on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the Earth has brought forth a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands at us at -- even the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of especially courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever of Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector, to search for gravitational waves, which arise through colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them thought they were crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">"but enough people recognised them as crazy geniuses, so that the US National Science Foundation funded their idea."</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the Laser Interferometer Gravity Observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo increased considerably, which greatly improved recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, it is called Advanced Ligo."</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last trial in order to clarify some minor, stubborn problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, only a few days after the detector's start-up, the gravitational waves of the two colliding black holes conveyed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And through the detector as well.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The Birth of my Daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the departure from my toddler father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically they were the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves of black holes and her by observatories like Ligo. but what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational wave is a cracking in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when dragging the shaft, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and stamped into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">"for illustrative, lecturers in courses for relativity-theory often lead to a really albery dance."</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretching and dusting, stretching and dusting."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14, for example, each of us was stretched and stalled by us when hitting the waves. the elongation of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that is 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre-long laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be accurately measured on less than a thousandth of the radius of a nuclear nucleus. that's grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in the construction of such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">"but physicists are inventive and with the support of the public, all obstacles will certainly be overcome."</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to claim that Ligo is more of an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because you can create a picture or a map of things by taking the light around you from several points."</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"that is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead we listen to certain qualities such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now, just Alice speaks."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts them."</seg>
<seg id="516">"drummer Bob."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same applies to gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple images of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo the measured frequencies are in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe."</seg>
<seg id="522">"listening to the gravitation can tell us a lot about the collision of two black holes, with which my colleague Scott has been busy for quite a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">SH: two black non-rotating holes simply: wupp!</seg>
<seg id="524">"if the two bodies rotate very quickly, one hears the same panty with an additional key change. that sounds like: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement vocabulary, imprinted in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- No one who knows what to hear will recognize this as sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold sun mass each, which rotate around as quickly as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let us consider briefly what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve around one hundred times a second before colliding."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know of it because we've heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the lasting meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo paves a whole new way to explore the universe as it has never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">"on this way, we can listen to the space and hear the invisible."</seg>
<seg id="535">We can't see much in space -- practical or basically -- not.</seg>
<seg id="536">"Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in super-novas."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. we have learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes occur in the core, hidden behind thousands of kilometres of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never see through since these opaque are.</seg>
<seg id="540">"the Big Bang: I would love to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see it as the Big Bang is covered by its own afterglow."</seg>
<seg id="541">"using gravitational-waves, it should be possible to look back to the beginning."</seg>
<seg id="542">"and the most important thing: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says on this subject: me: the kind of stars that cause black holes, as Ligo sees them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"they are enormous, ancient bodies of prehistoric times. the black holes are so to say the sour bones for our archeological work."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a completely different point of view of the events happening in space, on the origin of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now is to be as bold as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on Earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than to listen to the Big Bang itself?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">You can dream with us.</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">Some time ago I tried an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="555">"for one year, I would say" "Yes" "to all that I was afraid of."</seg>
<seg id="556">"whether it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start playing with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what I was afraid of, eliminated my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to keep speeches, my social fear -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes" changed me.</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that changed my life deeply into an unexpected way. it started with a question of my little ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson."</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my beak-cup."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked her once, if I could play with her when I was just on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This Yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on I swear to always play with them whenever you ask me to do so. no matter what I'm doing or where I go, I always say yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magic effect on me, on my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I fully understood that the" "yes" "say to play with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">"I am a writer. I think things, awaken you to life."</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I do television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program in the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programs, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each shipment has hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a television station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days four shows, so all nine days 20 million dollars television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three programmes simultaneously in production, once four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: how To Get Away With Murder, 10 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours TV"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">"in America, my TV series are running each other on Thursday evening."</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series are running in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV hours are broadcasts that I have created myself and not only produced, so still above. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around campfires and tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfire burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who still does it?</seg>
<seg id="598">"no one, therefore I'm a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I tell you so that all of you who work so hard whether you now run a company, a country or a classroom, a business or a household, take me seriously if I speak of work so you understand that I don't just mess around the computer and fanciful, and it's true when I say: I understand that it does not dream about dreaming."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it is all a job, all work, everything, everything blood, everything sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I'm immersed in my work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a land out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">"it is like I set up troops, when I painted on a canvas."</seg>
<seg id="608">"so as to carry a high note, deliver a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all that at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"she is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and reasonable."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a buzz begins in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like an animated street, I could drive on it forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">Many people accept when I declare to them the sums that I talk over writing that writing gives me joy.</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't understand me wrong, that's what it does."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I began working with TV production, when I began to work and work and work, build, create and work together, I discovered this thing, this humming, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The sums are action and activity. the sums are a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums are music. the sums are light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The sums are God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such a sum, then you cannot strive differently than by size."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of not being different than aiming for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called the sums.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or maybe it also means to be a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Perhaps it is called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps ego is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is the fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I just know I'm not made for failure, and I just know that I love the sums."</seg>
<seg id="631">I just want to tell you that I'm a Titan and I know I don't want to question it.</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more broadcasts, the more episodes, the more work there is, the more work, the more I write history, the more I write history, the more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what do I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the land I create, the marathon, which I run, the army, the canvas, the high sound, the sums, the totals, the totals."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this sum. I love the sums.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the sums.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this humming?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overhauled, overloaded, overdone, burned out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The totals stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single job.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" "my mum won't be there, but you can write my Nanny."</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1 when summoning was heard."</seg>
<seg id="649">The totals of the engine stopped.</seg>
<seg id="650">I didn't love my work any more. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My sump was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I made the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing to delegate, a titanium is not asleep, does not give up, with wholeheartedly, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a showcase Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I just had no fun anymore."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the humming and the sums I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think," "Get out, stupid author-Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do it, you work, you love what you do to be a teacher, a banker to be a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, one simply loves another and that gives one the sum if you know the sum, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"if the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I am on the way to the outside, late on it and she says," Mom, do you like to play? "</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say no when two things become aware of me:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I have to say yes to all and secondly, she did not call me" etching. ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She calls no more "etching."</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I'm Titan and my totals smog, and here everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mom, do you like to play?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding, because my pain and my panic, in loneliness and in the absence of the sum, I can't do anything except to watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am silent.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the land I create, the marathon which I run, the army, the screen, the high sound - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"all that exists are sticky finger and wet kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it is about letting go, or whatever the girl lets in" The Ice Queen. ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Peace and simplicity are everywhere.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so tight that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me solves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door opens and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that not immediately, but it happens it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I would know a magical mystery.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of work, the sums of money, this is only the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, when I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and TV hours and how functionally my brain is, then I forgot what the real sum is."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not a force and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sums depend on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"real sums ignore the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real buzz is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"the real sum is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered the wrong words to me, for which God told me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is simply love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a little more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wishes to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic from any guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the sums again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not just like working.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like playing it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer at work than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what kind of man works better than being at home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan. ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I'm too relaxed is none of it.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rave around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we do small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We burst soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always grab on my phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is OK.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the totals of the universe complies me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">"you can do it too! always say yes, if your child wants to play with you."</seg>
<seg id="741">"perhaps keep me naïve, for a daydream."</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they are not Rihanna or a Muppet show figure.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">There are only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">My little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes until they think they want to do something else.</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybird or biscuit is replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talking to my teenage daughter for 15 minutes, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"it is only 15 minutes, there is no need for it."</seg>
<seg id="752">"each can take 15 minutes, even on a bad mood!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes a piece!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children get ready."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. it does not have to be the children. it is important to feel the humming, to have a place for his peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about pleasure,"</seg>
<seg id="759">"in order to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you are doing well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and keep it out.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I will fail and I won. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" "is short for everything I gave up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes on the track why not allow for full 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong about it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seem to return if I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself in my office again. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the sums, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I am not the sums, the sums are not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">Soap bubbles and sticky hands. dinner with friends.</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my sum.</seg>
<seg id="775">The totals of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The totality of love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sums of work is part of me, but just a part. and I am so thankful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">I don't know that I'm a Titan. I've never seen a Titan that plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire still burns.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clear my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the sums. the land I create, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the canvases, the high sound, the totum, the sums, the other, the right sum: the totals of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this humming, the more this unusual, consistent, bare and new feeling of life is wide within me. less titanium - more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel exactly this humming, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am a writer. I think about things, I awaken you to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"that is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">A dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"do you want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">Like most of my colleagues I have to do with human tragedies every day.</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons, it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">That is the reason why I became functional neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions through various surgical interventions.</seg>
<seg id="804">"certainly, they have heard of one of the best known, the" "depth cerebral stimulation." "an electrode is implanted deep in the brain to influence the neurons in such a way that the neurological function is improved."</seg>
<seg id="805">It is truly an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered from severe trembling and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">"however, neuromodulation does not mean neuro healing."</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeons is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to it.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help itself."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">At that time I was senior physician and worked day and night in the emergency room.</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I provided patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"you have to imagine that the brain is swollen with cranium cerebral traumas, and the cranial pressure increases."</seg>
<seg id="815">"to save life, you have to reduce the cranial pressure."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of a swollen brain compound.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues, a biologist."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to let cells grow out of this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to grow cells from a tissue piece is comparable to very small children, which are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find proper nutrition, temperature, humidity and environments to thrive."</seg>
<seg id="823">This is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">After many attempts it made Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="825">This he saw under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked like a stem cell culture. with large green cells, which are surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"you may already know from biology class that stem cells are immature cells, which can turn into any cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to receive this type of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the operating room.</seg>
<seg id="832">We did another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They spread slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new, strange cell population which looked like stem cells but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed a long time to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">At the stage of the fetus they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why are they staying for us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We do not know this.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they take part in the healing of the brain, as we find it in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">"one thing, however, is clear -- we got our stem cells from these cells."</seg>
<seg id="849">We are facing a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to take a piece of brain mass from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells exactly as Jean-François did.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then mark them in color in order to be able to track them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we re-planted them at the birth of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- Autotransplantation.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we re-implant these cells into normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we re-implant the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">Thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller we were able to work with apes.</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we re-planted the cells into a healthy brain, and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared completely as if they were taken back, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">In the second scenario we added a violation and re-planted exactly the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons.</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you can see what we were able to observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that were re-planted.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells, which we dye in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets from a tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable skill level, we last in the motor cortex the hand motor range."</seg>
<seg id="869">"as a result, the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"patients are paralysed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to some extent, just like with the monkey."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached its degree of spontaneous relaxation, we implanted its own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">"on the left you see the monkey, who spontaneously recovered."</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from prior to injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not as precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"now see when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the implantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that these were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">"since that time, we have found a lot more about these cells."</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use it in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>

<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, perhaps even the majority, think:" I know someone who can do that. "</seg>

<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical trials involving human beings."</seg>
<seg id="887">Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results you have to fill in about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this kind of studies.</seg>

<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you have completed research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it takes before someone can enter the hospital and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: that's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical study."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to start it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to choose the patients to perform the treatments and evaluate whether it is useful to do this kind of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, it is necessary to apply this to a multicenter study."</seg>
<seg id="897">You must first really prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to everyone.</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider it as a matter of course.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we do not see democracy as the fragile plant it actually is, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to look at them as immutable indifference.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">That is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great imitators in Beijing proved doubtless that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth while politics remains completely undemocratic.</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year, when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- I was unequivocally clear to me as the finance minister in the Eurogroup that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not affect the austerity programmes that were implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment, I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my rebellious friends, who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present an economic model for real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China, and even the Eurogroup succumb to a mistake, we could save ourselves democracy, but that we need a true and defensible democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies are becoming brighter, our future gloomy, and our great, new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the topic of extravagance, I would like to remind you of an interesting contradiction which currently threatens our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">I call it the "Twin Summit Paradox."</seg>
<seg id="916">"a summit is known to you. you know and recognize it as the debt mountain, which throws its long shadows over the USA, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the debt mountain,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy depositors and corporations, which, however, are too fearful to invest there where it would be productive and contribute income with which you can carry out the debt mountain and also produce all the things that humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"in the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars were invested in the United States, England and the Eurozone, in all the wealth producing goods, such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"$3.4 Billion US dollar is looking for a lot of money until one compares it with the 5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and absolutely nothing to inflate except the stock exchanges and exhuffle the real estate prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">Thus debt and unproductive capital form the twin peaks which are not compensated by the usual market mechanisms.</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-olds in the USA, Japan and Europe unemployed, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand, which, as in a final loop, strengthens the pessimism of investors who, fearing the prophecy of the rooker, could be true that his son would kill him if he is grown up,"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally bring about the circumstances that cause Oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">That is my hair with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his exceedingly lavish art. all the unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we continue, what do we mean by democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the social form in which the free and the poor as a majority control the government.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, Athenian democracy closed too many --"</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">"however, it would be a mistake to diminish the significance of Athenian democracy because of these exclusions."</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive part of the Athenian democracy was and is that it withdrew the working poor, and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which allowed them to give them the right to political co-determination with the same voice weighting in questions of the state of state."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle, which shines brightly, it is also burnt out quickly."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our present-day liberal democracies did not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in the Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while Athenian democracy concentrated on free citizens and strengthened the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which in the end was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was confined to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- became a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, a relentless struggle between the two took place, gradually undermining politics and escapes them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer the same as before?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not up to a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because the government can now be in the government and still not in power, because the power of politics is migrated into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my Hades with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it's about like a herd of carnivores who sustainably decimated the animals from which they nourished, that they are starving at the end."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that has harmed politics so far that it harms itself by the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of corporations is growing, political goods are devalued, inequality rises, the overall economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too scared to invest the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" demos "from democracy, the higher the twin peaks, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of humanity."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we must bring together politics and the economy again, and it would be better if the" demos "keeps control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist left already had this idea 100 years ago and it did not look very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The doctrine of the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor recover only through a miracle a position as in ancient Athens without creating new forms of brutality and waste.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is one solution: to abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low wage workers through automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste of sublime, and the social conflicts deeper, just as it -- very soon as I think -- in countries like China will come."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must transform the economy and reunite the fields of business and politics, and make sure that we democratize the reunified area, otherwise we end up in a disease monitoring hyperautocracy, which makes the film" Matrix "appear like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technical achievements that it has produced."</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopie similar to that in" matrix, "or by something similar to the society in" Star Trek, "or in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora, "in long talks to indulge in the meaning of life."</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">"so what would it be, how could it look like this" Star Trek "-like utopia instead of the" matrix "-like dystopia?"</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in a nutshell."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the business area: please imagine a capital market where you earn money while you are working and in which your capital follows you from one workstation to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">"then all income from capital and revenue came from, and the concept of wage labor is completely obsolete."</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the enterprises, but they do not work in it, and employees who work there, which the company does not belong to. no exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no rising twin summit."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy, please briefly introduce our national currencies to have a freely fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency backed by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the entire world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the Cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and each government pays the sum equal to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country, into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund invests in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time you did not have the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today, we have them, in particular against the background of a reunited policy and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is at the same time liberal in which she prefers privileged people, and Marxian because it is buried in the separation of capital and labour in the garbage bin of history, and Keynesian, global keynesianische."</seg>
<seg id="973">"but above all, it is a world where we can imagine a real democracy."</seg>
<seg id="974">We will wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we choose politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratic."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">"father Giussani:" "Yanis..." ""</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if any of what I just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers calls" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the Earth to the next, as we currently experience it, it will not only destabilize our democracies, but also countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is true, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"like Hayek, therefore I am a libertarian Marxist, and like Keynes, and that's why I am also perfect."</seg>

<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: it's a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said that. BG: in your presentation you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at dinner of the speakers you said very clearly what you think of the West's view to China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">"in our liberal democracies, we have the appearance of democracy."</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in some ways, if I can say this provocative, China is similar to the 19th century England."</seg>
<seg id="995">Because -- remember -- we tend to connect liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, Liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can observe in China is very similar to the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, especially the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to now reproach China to do what the West has done in the 19th century, smells of hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">"BG: I am sure, that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Minister of Finance of Greece at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I guess that is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half-year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the Eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say good-bye to the self-complacency, and the continuous denial that a massive destruction line passed through the eurozone, and continues to spread massively to the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately the powers within the eurozone, within the Euro zone, continued to accept denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience of the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to get an economic system that is not viable to live through political will and authoritarianism, you might have to delay it for a while, but when the change occurs, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you think ahead?</seg>
<seg id="1013">"YV: there is no doubt that the Eurozone has no future, if we do not change its structure."</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>

<seg id="1017">"if there is a Minister of Finance, or any Minister, who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, asserts that he did not make any mistakes, then this is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for the extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the sides of the financiers to find a common solution.</seg>

<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">This is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"Roy Price has never heard most of the most, although he is probably responsible for 22 moderate minutes of your life on 19th April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">That goes back to the decision that Roy met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is senior manager at Amazon Studios</seg>
<seg id="1042">The Amazon TV production company.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an Igelfrisur and describes himself on Twitter as" films, TV, technology, tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for picking up the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can't choose any one.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he must find shows, which are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he must find shows that are on the right side of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">"this curve is the rating distribution of more than 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the height shows how many shows get this rating."</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is valued at nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addictive, where, after watching a relay, your brain asks:" where are more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- that should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">Roy Price doesn't worry about getting to the left side of the curve because I think you need special intelligence to support "Toddlers and Tiaras."</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he makes more thoughts about the average balance, the average television -- the shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't delight."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it's the first time that Amazon is doing something, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create successes.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he holds a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and selects eight candidates for TV shows through an evaluation, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online where everyone can watch them for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and if Amazon comes out for nothing, it's up to you, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators are watching these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are watched while watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">You are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you can capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you jump over or look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">They collect millions of data to decide which show they should produce with these data.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process these and hence the answer, and this is:" "Amazon should make a sitcom about four republican U.S. senators."</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anyone know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show, because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it is just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands at 7.5 -- so slightly above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"at the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming Netflix. just like Roy, he is always looking to find it a super show and he also uses data for it, but he does it differently."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hosting a competition, he and his team looked at the existing data on Netflix Viewer, so the reviews they give to the shows, their course, which shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: which shows they like, which producers, what actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the pieces together, they entered a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four senators, but a drama series about a senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 review on this curve.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"there are two very competitive, data-sealed firms."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they connect these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is this?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic somehow states that it should work in everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you meet, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis doesn't work, then this is a bit scary because we live in a time in which we live more and more to statistics to make serious decisions far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the Multi-Health System here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"no one. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">Multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope nobody in this room ever comes into contact with this software. come into contact with it you are in prison.</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in jail here in the USA and asks for release, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it is decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always the best results are generated. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">Even the data of experienced companies are sometimes wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can foresee due to data analysis outbreaks of influenza, the bad kind of predictions -- by data analysis of Google's research."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a big news sensation. the success culminated in a release in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfectly, year by year, until it suddenly didn't work anymore,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of the publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"in spite of all these mistakes, data flow into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the legal implementation, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should rather make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics -- an area where some very clever people use unimaginably many data to make serious decisions, as the decision for cancer therapy"</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have recognised some patterns of the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"if you have to solve a complex problem, you mainly do two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, put this problem into its parts so you can analyze the items; as a branch you put the items together to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things to take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are only good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help dismantle a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts again and then come to a decision.</seg>
<seg id="1116">For this there is another tool and we all have it all: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"when there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I think Netflix was so successful, because they used data and understanding where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audiences, which they would otherwise not have been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like" House of Cards, "did not stand in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">"Ted Sarandos and his team made this decision for this show, which meant that they took a great personal risk with this decision."</seg>
<seg id="1121">"Amazon, on the other hand, did this in the wrong way."</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions, first as they vie for TV ideas, then chose" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they could always say: "that's what the data say to us."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I believe things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data is just a tool, and in order not to forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was any data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">It is also called "Magic 8 Ball." it's amazing. for decisions using a Ja- or no question you just have to shake the ball to get an answer. "most likely" -- right here at this moment.</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fuse it later with a technical demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"so far I have made some decisions in my life so far, whereby I should have listened to the ball in hindsight."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you know, of course, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it with something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it is up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right turn."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I received this as a very encouraging message that despite the large amount of data, it still pays off making decisions to be an expert in what you are doing and taking risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"in the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you end up at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
