Munich 18@@ 56 : four maps that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren institution where young people should meet today .
a cryp@@ t chapel that is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
small gar@@ den@@ ers are cultiv@@ ating the former ground of peasants .
the oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it anno@@ ys when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows everybody who had to upset himself because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ At@@ las@@ es , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bav@@ arians of the state government , are anything but current - but very revealing . &quot;
especially when comparing them with current online maps .
then it becomes clear how towns and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of the Munich Merk@@ ur have changed since the 19th century .
&quot; the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work carpet , which one recognizes as such . &quot;
&quot; the large map of the map became more detailed maps , so @-@ called prim@@ eval sheets for towns and municipalities . &quot;
these were created according to the Bavarian sur@@ veying business between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and spring from the first survey of Bavaria .
your principal : Napoleon .
the French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .
&quot; Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country , and commissioned a top@@ ographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes . &quot;
&quot; after all , when the French troops came out with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville on February 9 , 18@@ 01 , the present neighbours who created the idea of a surface @-@ covering Bavaria card were . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph drove the project forward , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and there@@ with the Bavarian Sur@@ veying Administration . &quot;
the original composition sheet for Munich dates back to 18@@ 56 and is like any other on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; an example of this is the Unter@@ send@@ ling , which is still relatively isolated in the 18@@ 56 map . &quot;
&quot; Send@@ ling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map , thus in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
&quot; today , Unter@@ send@@ ling is in the middle of the city . &quot;
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ straße , which was first named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today the west park is , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : at the zo@@ oming out appears a small @-@ scale map with dozens of lines and numbers : hand @-@ written numbered plots from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; pri@@ mal @-@ up &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; small plots today show no farmers , but small gar@@ den@@ ers of the plant &quot; land in the sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the site of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the field of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; or from the height &quot; Auf der Lü@@ fte &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße , people once locked up people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 , the Munich district @-@ Ir@@ ren@@ anstalt &quot; &quot; On the Au@@ er Lü@@ fte &quot; &quot; was created there . &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden headed the institution - that psychiat@@ rist , who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was advanced for his time and , for example , ended the Ank@@ hing of the so @-@ called Irish . &quot;
&quot; he also prohibited the staff from applying force against occup@@ ants , &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Hai@@ d@@ hausen museum , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients first place , later , 500 seats were added . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Krei@@ si@@ r@@ ren@@ anstalt in Haar@@ 1905 . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts , has been there since 2006 . &quot;
young people meet at Sal@@ esi@@ anism in Munich on the site of former Au@@ er Anst@@ alt .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments .
&quot; west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; &quot; was built in architec@@ tonic style to the country of origin of the asylum @-@ institution , which had been destroyed during World War II by bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was listed in 18@@ 56 as &quot; &quot; Main Square &quot; , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .
a big remained until today - at the Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t chapel dating back to the Middle Ages stood at the Mari@@ enhof where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn line . &quot;
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Group published travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
national unification for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Mis@@ sour@@ i because of the discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks of the state .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which will enter into force by August 28 , 2017 , calls on af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i@@ ans to pay special attention during travel through the state , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based occur@@ ren@@ ces can occur throughout the state and be noted here , &quot; &quot; says the Group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law by Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it more difficult for people to claim discrimination , as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , prompted the group to release the warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the President of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA .
&quot; the group cited incidents like rac@@ ist attacks against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
&quot; S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being charged with a crime . &quot;
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i Public Prosecutor , which is shown that black mot@@ orists in the state are 75 percent more common than wh@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; &quot; said Chapel . &quot;
people have to be prepared to bring the deposit money or let the relatives know they travel through the state .
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i reported 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI &apos;s hate crime reporting program , which classi@@ fy the state with regard to the number of such violations in the 16th place of the country . &quot;
&quot; the travel warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it more difficult to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had passed immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations , which , according to the AC@@ L@@ U , will contribute to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately interest groups have put the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
electric fence project is elementary
the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Wei@@ de@@ fence project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U members of Parliament Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac have given themselves a picture on the spot .
&quot; at the right @-@ wing cemetery of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family , representatives of the CD@@ U local associations met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann first granted insight into his farm , in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young animals , and accommodated in five apartments holiday palaces . &quot;
&quot; for him , the &quot; Black Forest milk &quot; is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , so Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
only region@@ ales can be found on the table of the Feri@@ eng@@ ä@@ ste .
&quot; since it is also BL@@ H@@ V chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the fence project as &quot; elementary . &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit@@ ably manage on such steep surfaces .
&quot; the green area care for a lot of work , much needs to be worked on with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight here with the conditions and with the top@@ ography , &quot; &quot; stressed Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if he did not lead a biogas plant . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leadership . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
it is hoped that the re@@ for@@ estation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operations , &quot; &quot; said the mayor . &quot;
the farmers are often in the criticism because of the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 par@@ c@@ els were fenced off by eleven participants . &quot;
&quot; the open @-@ air area covers an area of 40 hectares , which can not be br@@ ushed up to at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; from the total cost of € 71 500 , half was funded by leaders , a quarter contributed to the community of fishermen . &quot;
&quot; thus , the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16.@@ 2 kilometers of pasture fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; explained Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and land@@ ladies it is not possible . &quot;
&quot; Peter Weiß asser@@ ted that &quot; &quot; best food is produced here . &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Wu@@ ert@@ tem@@ berg provides the state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art production of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the aim is to disclose the Black Forest .
the pre@@ condition is the availability of a material drawn by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the area to be enclosed must not be smu@@ gg@@ able ( slope of over 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by aff@@ or@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s Wei@@ dez@@ v@@ aun@@ ching Project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots , who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the disclosure surface is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking up the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans value these as well as any other - hence the carefully orchest@@ rated overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ do Square in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ olo@@ gues of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated argument with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N about the President &apos;s proposals on the dr@@ astic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ ators would have sm@@ itten him if he had done it .
&quot; but he resor@@ ted to their significance , and in particular the importance that it was attributed to , when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its basis . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta compla@@ ined , &quot; I don &apos;t want to mention a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
&quot; the poem , which you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; Miller is fac@@ tual right , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , / your oppressed masses who y@@ earn to breathe freely , / the poor waste of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; turning waste &quot; on our screens was better to see .
Miller did not commit himself in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mps USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America .
&quot; Lazarus - and her friends , who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action . &quot;
the sculpture was to show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by portra@@ ying the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical depic@@ tion .
Lazarus has changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot;
&quot; the great writer R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neo@@ conservative that brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty goes ahead . &quot;
she is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch should not illumin@@ ate the way to the United States .
Lim@@ bau@@ gh is rather unusual here .
the meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative act of Lazarus consisted in seeing them as they were seen by the exhausted , afflicted but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the true sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .
&quot; and that is , of course , not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever wish to acknowledge . &quot;
&quot; their torch should not illumin@@ ate the path , but the hatred that is their only source of power ign@@ ites . &quot;
world Cup 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish members of the UK team
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots were part of the UK team
&quot; the performance director of the United Kingdom &apos;s athle@@ tics , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the world championship race will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 to start on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; in Scotland something special &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the UK have to learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will carry it forward until we find it out , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British athle@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , among them Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ chart , who will compete against Sir William Far@@ ah on the 5000 m circuit , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; her Captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; said Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , that E@@ ili@@ d@@ h , naturally brought in , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth Silver Med@@ al W@@ inner , competing in their fifth world champi@@ onships with the 400 @-@ m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; unbelievable &quot; that 16 Schot@@ ten are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; until now , Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes competing in the World Cup was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the middle distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this path and last year placed five British and two European records .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman , which you should watch for a great season , which included victory at the British Team Tri@@ als and Anni@@ versary Games . &quot;
Do@@ yle re@@ members her first world champi@@ onships as the only other Scot@@ sman in Team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says that they are &quot; enormously proud &quot; of the fact that many of their comp@@ atri@@ ots are not only part of the team , but in some cases also with the medals and at the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my team@@ mates have voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots who belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as well @-@ established athletes , athletes who want to rise to platforms . &quot;
what is my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think it went well . &quot;
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion .
&quot; I get a second chance to go out there and compete , and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . &quot;
blocking critics on Facebook : do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the in@@ fu@@ sions of voters
the father of our country knew something of bad news .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers struck him because of everything , from domestic politics to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he kno@@ cked at the cri@@ tique , for sure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and mu@@ te , we are led like sheep for slaughter . &quot;
&quot; this brings me to Mary@@ land , Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan , who must work to be more like Washington . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people , who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union , therefore , accused him of the beginning of this week . &quot;
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online commentary was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , &quot; and ? . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; &quot; said many people . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type like Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest approval of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat@@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observ@@ ance of the principles .
&quot; he was also very skil@@ ful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters , playing his hair @-@ loose head after chemotherapy on his side . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the block@@ age of persons coming to the governor &apos;s side is a public forum , which is considered official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gans spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking of comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it &apos;s too easy to use the picture of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people who vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a pastor , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the priest quoted the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan &apos;s Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani von Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not hat@@ eful , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I commented on pol@@ itely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news , &quot; she wrote in the comment section of the news posting &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t appreciate this idea , if a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are ignored by some rather than a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the Gover@@ nor &apos;s staff referred to as &quot; &quot; concentrated spam attack &quot; &quot; would probably call &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical items , or to arrest and silence the demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
but that exactly happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official to critic@@ ise Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question was last week in Virginia .
&quot; the President of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County dump@@ ed First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to U.S. District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they banned a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit to the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
this should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of an affordable port had a similar effect on the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers was multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous letters written on his leadership . &quot;
and even then Washington had anonymous troll@@ s .
&quot; people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ zio , &quot; wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions , who critic@@ ised the Treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Paper of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he did not put them to silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses belong to the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for home comforts in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for home comforts during the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year in the Arch@@ er@@ field Links up to the final round , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as a tournament ambassador in the name of the club founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I have seen how the Renaissance club was built and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; the players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he found this place .
he is an avi@@ d champion of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although he won both the European Tour as well as the European Challenge Tour in his 32 @-@ year career . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player in South@@ port . &quot;
&quot; I have not been able to defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open , since it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it . &quot;
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of the last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
Gary Or@@ r who came to European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday earlier this year returns to the action on home ground .
this event will be the first Scottish performance ever since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when you play at home , &quot; said Or@@ r , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel that extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy about how far it has gone .
&quot; the trio on the field is the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ ever . &quot;
&quot; the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce belongs to the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; entrance is free , the car park costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more occup@@ ants . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less lung cancer by passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 lung cancer cases are attributable to passive smoking per year , &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this issue of 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there have been 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking a year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .
domestic connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the construction works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; says the director of the yard Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is a lot of hide in the underground , which is not noticeable in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which hin@@ ders construction work , is a major problem for St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s construction company . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers from red lights and barriers is already enormous , &quot; explains Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are entitled to go through .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ dec@@ z and Tim Ko@@ dec@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been busy working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were quite exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but luckily we were supplied with cool mineral water by our friend Fritz Matt , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ dec@@ z . &quot;
poverty and Death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she does not use a stove . &quot;
it even rarely uses a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ ot@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent@@ ship in the troubled Indon@@ esian province of Papua , the house@@ wife usually places a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly into the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour , the sal@@ ted bul@@ b is taken and swal@@ lowed with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she doesn &apos;t have furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in a dach@@ ess space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as the youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , late work can be dangerous : most villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavy , and there are soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to walk around the village after 17 o &apos;clock , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders should vote in front of the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up independence against Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which maintains the control of the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , whereas the independent part of Papua New Guinea belonged to the eastern part of the island . &quot;
&quot; the trip includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the province capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with a rental car . &quot;
there is no public transportation .
&quot; the city with about 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo f@@ ences , and made of corrugated boxes , which have been transformed into different yellow @-@ brown tones by rust . &quot;
&quot; very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their trip here , let alone journalists and practically no for@@ eigner . &quot;
&quot; before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans rever@@ ed a god called U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were also other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wear these clothes , &quot; De@@ ge@@ i says and points to their lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , their dark shirt and their bright coat . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had sheets at our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indonesia &apos;s gold country .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gr@@ ass@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high country province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has mined gold and copper worth 3.1 billion US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua has wood resources valued at $ 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these riches , however , are a source of misery for the Papua , to ensure that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military keeps a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 almost 20 million US dollars , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ an demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten these golden go@@ ose and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 people have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 @-@ s became genocide according to the Asia @-@ Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police last year arrested more than 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; we value Every@@ thing , &quot; stated in a report by the Arch@@ dioc@@ ese Bris@@ ban@@ e from 2016 , in which reports on atro@@ cities of the previous year are included , such as un@@ lawful kill@@ ings and torture - rape and electrical charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal repression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims as every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia Explorer for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; screws have increased , since Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s resources produce a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia . &quot;
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development changes since Muslim economic migrants come from the populated islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ ped cant@@ e@@ ens sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce served . &quot;
local people are struggling to stay here .
&quot; the migrants began to sell chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local ones , &quot; A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native , moved to work in the province capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
&quot; it has cost the native Papua - the mo@@ m @-@ mo@@ m &#91; the women &#93; from Papua , their market . &quot;
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as the Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised the ine@@ qualities and violations of the law in Papua in 2014 . &quot;
the former carp@@ enter secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we voted for Jok@@ ov@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; says You . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in en@@ ig@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke out on a motorcycle through the darkness . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them they were to turn off their head@@ lights .
&quot; one of the soldiers offen@@ ded their tone and later came back with four soldiers , thus the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their rif@@ les , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .
&quot; a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so severely beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby governmental commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice . &quot;
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and performed the Wa@@ ita dance - running in circles and a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators started hur@@ ling stones at police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers sent a command over an internal funk : &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , &quot; in an official document issued by TI@@ ME , which was not released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , the head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto neighborhood of En@@ ot@@ ali , saw the danger threatening and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
no one was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I suddenly got shot into my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said TI@@ ME on the porch of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , the witness of shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and searched his body to make sure he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ anes , who only carries a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua @-@ Police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers wanted to &quot; secure &quot; their station only because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua @-@ Police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it is about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
&quot; the news of the kill@@ ings was first &quot; &quot; filtered &quot; &quot; on the following day to Jak@@ arta . &quot;
&quot; three weeks , Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be solved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defence , Wi@@ ran@@ to , said in October 2016 , that he would set up an extra@@ judicial mechanism for the deliber@@ ation of historical human rights violations . &quot;
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most injuries occurred a long time ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and the beginning of the 2000 @-@ year period .
&quot; the point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these violations , but there are processes that need to go through , &quot; he said . &quot;
then Wi@@ ran@@ to made a retreat when he spoke with TI@@ ME on 5 June in Jak@@ arta and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , charged by the UN for &quot; crimes against humanity &quot; , demanded more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence set out in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations were already included in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims accepted such claims with gri@@ m un@@ belief .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times in the last three years , but there was no progress , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ anes . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says he is still living in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m afraid of being arrested by the military , I &apos;m afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ obus repeated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was beaten by the military after he helped to bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not stopped .
on Tuesday the Indon@@ esian police fired on villa@@ gers in Pan@@ i@@ ai neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai .
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company , who refused to bring a person into hospital , one person and 17 others died , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , who was drow@@ ned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office bure@@ au .
the police said that villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but locals say that the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) began shooting down the crowd and killing one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be ven@@ ge@@ ance , &quot; &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were delivered here quickly , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called upon to hold the officers responsible and withdraw the mobile bri@@ g@@ ade of the police from the territory .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an ins@@ ane source for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ satisfaction of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many of them joined the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of Papua , attacking spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top o@@ PM leaders came from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ die Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people have been arrested and arbitr@@ arily detained in Pan@@ i@@ ai in recent years , under the pre@@ text of &quot; securing national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as a &quot; &quot; tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot; &quot;
poverty allevi@@ ates dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in en@@ ig@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is just as out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potato .
they keep the bulk of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
&quot; ten pieces of Not@@ a cost only 10,000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) . &quot;
&quot; over the course of time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new routes to the airport of Nab@@ ire . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and more prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; in Papua , they rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make their own enterprises competitive . &quot;
&quot; the young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal Council of Pan@@ i@@ ai . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ die and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although the rare permission was given to them . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Assistant Asia @-@ Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is election campaign were not implemented to raise the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ rest east@@ ern@@ most provinces of Papua and Western Europe : visa denial and a black list , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six p@@ acific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread violations &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically been supported by the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r , rejected the group &apos;s accus@@ ations and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence for human rights cases . &quot;
local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human right ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , people broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people say they are unlikely to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i again . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by people who are involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal Council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i to know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , except that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; guilt &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dations , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai shot victims resulted in a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of a victim was buried in an area exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know they will never give them justice , but at least they will not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family was killed , &quot; Y@@ ac@@ obus says with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire capture the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire found its passage in Dubai on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 meter high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire , which is swept through the high @-@ rise in just two years , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( tor@@ ches tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we slept and we got up with the fire alarm and the cries of the people . &quot;
&quot; we ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; told a resident who named George An@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units against 4.@@ 00 p.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) cleared the fire , and the building cooled down . &quot;
the government said she was working on providing accommodation for those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings all over the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the largest part of the damage caused by facing , exterior cl@@ adding for decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in the UK , the police said they believe that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has failed to attend the Annual General Meeting with his big Davis Cup .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City meeting , the proposal for this Sport @-@ revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup sing@@ let@@ on was not supported by the required two @-@ third majority . &quot;
&quot; that often very long , but even so much appreciated five @-@ set classics will be preserved to the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 per cent of the member states voted for reform , the goal of the IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore just missed . &quot;
we respect this decision but are disappointed that our member@@ ships did not accept the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup .
&quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
I will continue to work to improve the application .
&quot; not until the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal came to carry out the final in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 are only comparatively small details : in future , the fin@@ alists in the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup will be the host right next year in the first round . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements in terms of training positions etc. are facilit@@ ated and the players will have to perform less official media appointments in front of the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 out of 5 U.S. travelers bring prohibited items to the aircraft , finding a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by air passengers resulted in more than 20 percent aware or un@@ consciously prohibited items at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , among them at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft as they acci@@ dentally wore forbidden knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 percent said they had discovered that they had gone wrong with fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey carried out by more than 1,000 people - the one conducted by a jet charter service , the Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . , also noted that younger travellers rather ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; from the respon@@ dents who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something banned by the T@@ SA , 19.@@ 7 per cent mill@@ enni@@ als were compared with less than 15 percent , the members of Generation X . &quot;
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent said , know@@ ingly borne objects with blades by security control , while 2.2 percent of the female sur@@ vey@@ ed and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male respon@@ dents also confirmed that they had deliberately put banned drugs on the aircraft . &quot;
the company said it asked travelers throughout the country to find out how many mistakenly put smu@@ g@@ gling goods through airport security and how many people have deliberately done it .
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gled goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through security , those who are most frequent . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are somewhat complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which liquids they can carry along or how much of it .
so it is no surprise that the greatest amount of liquids banned by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel order
electric @-@ thous@@ and@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k enjoys the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far under@@ mined that a part of the customers has already withdrawn their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever @-@ trium@@ phant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la CEO El@@ on Mus@@ k first revealed a different , less gl@@ amor@@ ous figure for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Mus@@ k frequently had over 500,000 pre@@ orders for the new car , whose extra@@ dition is just beginning . &quot;
&quot; now Mus@@ k ad@@ mits : from the total of 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre@@ orders 6@@ 3,000 had already been withdrawn . &quot;
critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( US $ 1000 in the US and 1000 pounds ) &quot; Reser@@ vation Pay@@ ments . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ ,000 such non @-@ binding reservations pre@@ tend , clean Mus@@ k in a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of about twelve percent of all orders could be a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge with the ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; in the past year Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models are to be combined - 500,000 in 2020 , one million . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
&quot; according to Mus@@ k , 1800 reservations are made per day . &quot;
&quot; who orders today a &quot; Model 3 , &quot; can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never in practice tested production lines without any major interrup@@ tions with maximum utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if it comes to major delays , then the non @-@ binding of the reservations could become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; because then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ cont@@ ented customers from running off in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA manager P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s due to the postpon@@ ement of the rules of the Obama @-@ Er@@ a to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after having been su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , reg@@ ained its earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change as his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the governmental environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit which had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is a deadline for states that expi@@ red on October 1 , in order to comply with the standards of O@@ zone in 2015 . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay the compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth .
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp At@@ tor@@ ney of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , was a long time a reliable opponent of stric@@ ter environmental regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly passed on to block or delay regulation , to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels resist . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ ining regulatory roll@@ back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ al in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas company to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a statement released on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt suggested that its revers@@ al at o@@ zone standards is quite simply the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often not adher@@ ed to the deadlines for carrying out and then being accused of being charged by activists and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who su@@ ed EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously . &quot;
we also take the law and authority that gives us serious .
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA that P@@ ru@@ itt will eventually utilize its &quot; authority for delay and all other legally available powers to ensure that the rules &quot; are based on sound policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive revision of the o@@ zone rules .
a bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .
the measure was not set to vote in the Senate .

Tum@@ bling celebrates 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade on Sunday , 16 July at 4.@@ 30 p.m. &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant is a popular place to stay . &quot;
visitors to the Six@@ th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ gens to their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini stresses : &quot; it is a unique rural gem . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 , the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kapelle was first mentioned in documents by the Württem@@ berg@@ ischer deed of origin : count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold the mountain with the parish church to Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ tei &quot; at Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the document , there was also a beautiful courtyard on the Tum@@ our mountain except the former parish church , to which the church or the patron saint belonged , and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt of 18@@ 58 , it was next to the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf , which are still visible today in the village of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the scenic settlement nucleus of the village . &quot;
old maps from the period around the year 1600 are under@@ lined by these historical circumstances .
the privilege of pat@@ ron@@ ement arose from early medieval self @-@ church law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church , and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath the church . &quot;
associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
three alt@@ ars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .
the size of the two dis@@ member@@ ed at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell rang out for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but later had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were ham@@ mer@@ ed and the bel@@ fry were stolen . &quot;
the roof was leak@@ y .
&quot; in 17@@ 96 , French troops camped near the church . &quot;
they broke out the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used them as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church threatened to collapse in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ our Hil@@ arius @-@ cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was demol@@ ished .
only the church tower was stopped .
in the New Year &apos;s Night 18@@ 34 a storm split the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was demol@@ ished . &quot;
only the tower still present today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em are cultiv@@ ating the Hil@@ arius plant as success@@ ors by Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; the organizers invite friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth seren@@ ade on the old cemetery of St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel . &quot;
this is designed by the Freuden@@ stadt Com@@ bo of Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
the former Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann is talking about the final word .
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is available from 3.@@ 30 pm .
&quot; to the end of the seren@@ ade , there is a trunk in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with a wide view over meadows to the forest , the organizers put out fantastic views . &quot;
the seren@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organisers hope for many supporters for the preservation of the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is of importance for tum@@ ors and hearing schwei@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; friends and supporters of Tum@@ lin@@ gens are particularly committed to nursing home care , such as Ser@@ en@@ ade organizer Walter Mart@@ ini . &quot;
association wants approval of wind turbines to be checked
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim &quot; &quot; does not see any legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the council . &quot;
&quot; the association &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim denied &quot; &quot; has prompted Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association ar@@ gues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only at the border to Sch@@ wal@@ m@@ tal there exists a wind power concentration zone . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind turbines is generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones are intended to prevent a &quot; con@@ flu@@ ence &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , a few days earlier - but the district government Düsseldorf did not appro@@ ve it because of a fault . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval is still un@@ lawful and therefore also to be accepted , &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council once again decided to enter the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; permission of the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; &quot; this is where the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot;
the circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .
&quot; the corresponding letter has been received by district Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; explained a speaker . &quot;
the circle makes it the reason for re@@ viewing the matter .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday refused to express itself in terms of the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette the construction of four wind turbines of 200 metres each . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , has closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land . &quot;
&quot; with the construction of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - which corresponds to about a fifth of the electricity needs of all four @-@ grown households . &quot;
the NEW Re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen Stad@@ ler gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines at the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen and participating in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Kreis Hein@@ sberg . &quot;
car and tractor crashing : woman dies in terrible accident
one terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 a.m. on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ men@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded fat@@ ally .
two more people were easily injured .
the state road was closed for hours .
&quot; according to police specifications , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch entered the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as accompanying person accompanying her 53 years old mother . &quot;
city and retailer plan &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ salz@@ aer and people from the region are to re@@ discover the shopping possibilities in the city centre in September .
the trade association and the municipal authorities want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the residents to the city centre .
&quot; as Chairman of the Gewerbe@@ ver@@ eins , Christian König , announced that the &quot; &quot; home shop@@ per &quot; &quot; weekend the customers want to sensi@@ ti@@ ze what offers their own city apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; thus , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , domestic firms should present themselves with their apprenticeship places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearby region . &quot;
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that indicate the action weekend , says Christian König . &quot;
the Municip@@ ality and Trade Union cooperate with the chamber of commerce and industry .
thus the commercial association and the city enter into another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive downtown . &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; to the well and sold Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ people and hosts in order to move them to active participation . &quot;
also attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees on that day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ opened or re @-@ opened . &quot;
these include spa guests and tourists .
but many locals also lost sight of the city center when shopping .
&quot; in the end , everyone would have to contribute to li@@ ven up the city centre - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and societies . &quot;
&quot; it was necessary to overcome le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which had spread in part , had told King in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce at the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , announced that the third &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; day , for the first time , took part in five Thür@@ inger cities . &quot;
&quot; next to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the day should adverti@@ se &quot; &quot; for the appreciation of local trade and raise its significance for the common good of our cities , &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his purchasing behaviour .
two dead and several injured after an explosion at US school
&quot; during construction , it came to a gas explosion in the school building . &quot;
new people were injured .
&quot; in a gas explosion in the U.S. city of Min@@ ne@@ apolis , two people were killed and nine others were injured , some of them heavy . &quot;
&quot; according to the fire bri@@ g@@ ade , a vulner@@ ability was still in critical condition on Wednesday ( local time ) . &quot;
a man died when a part of a school building crashed at the explosion .
&quot; a first mis@@ sile , later , was also found dead . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the dead , it was an employee of the school . &quot;
&quot; as an accident , the authorities assumed work on a gas pipeline . &quot;
&quot; during the holiday season , only a few people stayed in the Minn@@ eh@@ aha Academy building . &quot;
Tru@@ mp put under pressure after le@@ aked tran@@ scripts from phone call Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia have been published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on 27 January , Tru@@ mp called for a telephone conversation with the Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to publicly say he would not pay for a planned border . &quot;
&quot; the US President compla@@ ined that he had publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; You cannot tell the press . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the USA , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull were also published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the United States immig@@ rated to Australia , &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; dum@@ b &quot; &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was given by the Obama administration would look like a &quot; Dep@@ p , &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the res@@ ett@@ lement of refugees in the US . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull that &quot; that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day . &quot;
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists lead rac@@ ist ly@@ n@@ ching act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ er Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in the Mon@@ ro@@ e countryside , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with rif@@ les to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ bs - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer strip - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants suspended in fear .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; &quot; the man ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; get him out of the car ! &quot;
scre@@ ams tore the silence when a young black man was dra@@ gged from the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately , this horrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is just a post @-@ order . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop is thrown around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; , &quot; almost everyone in the audience sounded very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 citizens of the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night , in which two black couples - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - have been ly@@ n@@ ched by K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one ever was accused of murder .
&quot; it is truly incredible that in all these years , no single person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of post @-@ order . &quot;
&quot; it is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state Georgia and a life of citizens .
for him it serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual memory of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice was never corrected .
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
a court physician places a bed cloth on the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ ch on 27 July 1946 .
&quot; according to FBI agents received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch process . &quot;
but no one ever was indic@@ ted .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects remain open for decades , civil rights say that the double motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court of the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens to vote in Georgia for the first time to vote for their vote in the summer . &quot;
&quot; about the same time as the election st@@ ach according to the FBI of the Black Far@@ mer Roger Mal@@ com a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city was that H@@ ester slept with Mal@@ com@@ s Mrs. Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .
&quot; on July 25 , 1946 , Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white country owner , paid 600 dollars to free Mal@@ com from prison , the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey to prison .
&quot; but when they went away from the prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out it was Har@@ rison who prepared and arranged the mur@@ ders , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a conspiracy between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removing evidence and obsc@@ ured the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was a massacre &quot; massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; if you let yourself be registered and if you vote , then this will happen . &quot;
&quot; for nearly a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has conducted the annual reproduction of the Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is clear , gri@@ pping and founded in a kind of deep racism , of which many would like to believe that he does not exist in America any more . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch and yet to look more difficult , but Gre@@ ene said that this is the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the Lyn@@ ch , because then we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I cannot build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or not want to hear what I &apos;ve been going through .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen wh@@ ites and the rest bl@@ acks - came into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed overview of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is here Gre@@ ene Co @-@ Director .
&quot; he has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room rehear@@ sed actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece starts with Mal@@ com , the H@@ ester cries and ur@@ ges him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , &quot; &quot; --@@ he , van@@ ish from my property ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
Ras@@ mus reci@@ proc@@ ates the fire .
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laughs at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ mus . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still gi@@ g@@ gling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think that white people at that time &apos; n --- &apos; he &apos; said &apos; .
&quot; but , &quot; one of the other black actors thunder@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; you just have to hit the hard &apos; R. &apos; . &quot;
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a feeling of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy getting this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time , when Ras@@ mus says the N word , he says it sharply and with im@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition is non@@ violent and fast .
&quot; there are cries , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed in a mour@@ ning dress , stands above the corp@@ se of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie Holidays mour@@ ning praise &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
your voice breaks every second word .
about a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen people caught sweat and tears from the eyes .
the audience is almost uni@@ form@@ ly divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple is coming from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
they all experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive moisture for almost eight hours when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the burial sites of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys .
&quot; up to this point , the mur@@ ders have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch Mor@@ de took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the dead bodies . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck in their heads , record the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ per one another . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes Gre@@ ene thanks the crowd - and suddenly it is over .
the actors throw away the Lyn@@ ch rope and wipe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w um@@ ar@@ mt Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ cona is embra@@ cing two of his fellow players and then weeping in their arms , the emotional load of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did this for a reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience joins together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white couple from Atlanta talks about the post @-@ creation with a black pair that they just met . &quot;
Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky was struggling to find words which feeling left the performance .
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like yourself and do what they do , because they look like you , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the ly@@ n@@ ching is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today it is called only police shooting . &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone sees Broo@@ ks &apos;s court at his table , he eats and reminds of the civil rights . &quot;
he said he started planning the performance next year .
&quot; the reproduction is inspiring in a way because it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so , if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Göt@@ ter@@ dämm@@ erung &quot; &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans to Bayreuth &quot;
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf relies on a colorful @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous staging in front of a gigantic six @-@ storey backdrop . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) also shows a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner together with the Wall and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Pla@@ ste and Ela@@ st &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhein@@ gold@@ chter pos@@ ing as a Rock@@ av@@ r@@ ls , or alternatively an Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stack@@ ed oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ f &apos;s leit@@ moti@@ v - money , power and greed - which moves through his &quot; ring &quot; staging . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ gold@@ chter - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ise as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold . &quot; &quot;

Stephen M@@ illing sings the splen@@ did@@ ly nasty Hagen surrounding the aura of a heav@@ y@@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal scene when he sm@@ iles Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus O@@ ak ) must also believe in it .
the audience thanks the ensemble with powerful applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are celebrated stor@@ my , humble and de@@ fle@@ cted by the hands of the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is a great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothes . &quot;
the performance was eag@@ erly awaited by Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors .
&quot; in 2013 , he had to leave a row of the Pfei@@ f@@ konzert , and five years later , there were great rejo@@ icing in which the isolated &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went down . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner looks forward to hearing from you .
&quot; you notice that the audience with the &quot; &quot; Ring &quot; &quot; has grown up in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience did not only make a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but it was also an understanding of its perception . &quot;
I prefer a positive summary .
Max quantity works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year right at several places .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in st@@ einf@@ urt in the furniture exchange , once a week I help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; it &apos;s a nice , broad spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are 26 years now , so a late @-@ time volunteer . &quot;
how does it come ?
quantity : I did Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a civil engineer studies , let &apos;s say , successfully broken off . &quot;
&quot; for me , I realized that it is wrong for me and I want to do something else , work with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked myself , what are you doing . &quot;
&quot; a social year , there is an insight , you can see how it is on site , in the focal point maybe also , really . &quot;
and was it like that ?
quantity : I collected great impressions .
I will start studying in the social system in the winter semester .
&quot; I will study dual , probably doing a social worker training at the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne and study in Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
is it not unusual to have several different places during the volunteer service ?
&quot; quantity : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it probably depends on where you are doing your FS@@ J .

&quot; with me , it was very varied . &quot;
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in the afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot;
I could see my own strengths and see how it really runs out .
different from civil engineering studies ?
&quot; lot : well , here it &apos;s not about calculating sten@@ cils . &quot;
there are always other people who have a completely different story behind them .
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a young man from the family , has been fet@@ ched out of the family - one must always respond to it individually . &quot;
very interesting .

&quot; Pear@@ son cuts further 3,000 jobs and cuts divi@@ den@@ ds to revi@@ ve business &quot;
&quot; British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that she will cut off another 3,000 jobs and cut its divi@@ den@@ ds by 72 percent , as another restructuring program will start to overcome the pressure that the company faces . &quot;
&quot; the job cuts that Chief Director John Fall@@ on announced for the end of 2018 and the start of 2019 , in addition to its previous restructuring , in which 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
&quot; in May , Pear@@ son announced plans to cut costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May in a third cost reduction program to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the fast pace to digital learning . &quot;
&quot; the company , which last month sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to the partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann , said that the outlook for the financial year remains unchanged after it achieved an increase of 1 percent to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds in the first half of the year . &quot;
Kab@@ ul con@@ voy attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide attack
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in Kab@@ ul , Afghanistan , killed a soldier of NATO and injured several others , say official officials . &quot;
&quot; five soldiers and an interpreter had been injured , declared a statement by NATO . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h district . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
&quot; in a statement by NATO , the explosion occurred on Thursday evening when a common pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and treated in the US military hospital at the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby B@@ agra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian fat@@ alities in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % of them in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , suicide bom@@ b@@ ings killed at least 30 people in a predominantly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had done this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the center of the city killed more than 150 people with the dead@@ liest milit@@ ant attack in the country since the US @-@ led troops pushed the Taliban out of power in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of U.S. troops that support military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul last week also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies and , in particular , the reputation of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns decision to delay the smo@@ g rule according to complaints
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has made a decision to delay regulation of the Obama administration , according to which states are obliged to cur@@ b the smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to advance the so @-@ called &quot; O@@ zone provisions , &quot; and said they are showing the agency &apos;s commitment to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in the dialogue with and from responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA boss Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in a statement . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of EPA in June to determine the o@@ zone regulations - in which in part of the country should be measured pollut@@ ant emissions , in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay stric@@ ter air quality standards - in order to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , along with the region of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to return a wide range of environmental regulations imposed by former President Barack Obama , as part of a broader agenda that is to boost economic growth according to Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the set@@ back of the demo@@ crats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the effects of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of the EPA says that inhal@@ ing air , o@@ zone containing &quot; &quot; reducing lung function and strengthening respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
Municipal Council wants common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : in two counter@@ parts , the Municipal Council of Flu@@ o @-@ Win@@ tz@@ els decides to set up a common area in the future retirement home . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing piece of land was signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although it will take a long time until the area belonging to the church has been owned by the church , there is now no planning obstacle for the project stem@@ ming from a private investor . &quot;
&quot; for this , there is a discussion about a common area . &quot;
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - some 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and majority of the Municipal Council prefers to see such a common room not as a meeting point for residents of sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous housing , but openly into the community . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; made the lap . &quot;
&quot; the decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget has already been decided last autumn , by funding opportunities . &quot;
the construction is in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common space would be , as reported by T@@ j@@ aden , with 60 percent of 30 percent eligible . &quot;
&quot; the proposed resolution looks to indicate the investor , that in this respect no bil@@ lets are drawn between the legs , suggest@@ ing that both saddle - which is le@@ aning against the surrounding construction - as well as the roof @-@ roof - which reduces the height and makes the construction more economical - would be possible . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer writes , be this addition . &quot;
when it helps : unanim@@ ously he passes the body .
it &apos;s not that easy with the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings , with which one cannot proceed as quite as possible , but now lean towards the common room out of the window , she says , &quot; &quot; I am hard with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is strictly speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a hidden subsi@@ dy to any wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , as with the acquisition of the surface one does not give any surplus , but gives a real , in the case of doubt market@@ able counter@@ value , that is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; Sta@@ ig@@ er &apos;s application , ple@@ ading for the proposed resolution , finds three advoc@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; so it remains with two opposing voices in the original program that Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; if we summ@@ ari@@ ze the decision , we make a huge step to close a gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with a car : cyclists are thrown on the road
&quot; when crossing the road , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist was captured by a car in Gar@@ ath on Wednesday and seriously injured . &quot;
&quot; as the police told me , the 82 @-@ year @-@ old Lan@@ gen@@ felder was on the road of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction of Hil@@ den . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder was driving onto the road , he apparently did not consider counter @-@ traffic . &quot;
&quot; he met with a car , who headed a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess . &quot;
the man was thrown into the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was brought to a hospital with a retreat car .
FC Bayern München has to refrain from the Super@@ cup at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel worries , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory game of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the cup winner .
personnel managers at the German Football Record Champion Bayern Munich are getting bigger before the Super@@ cup at Saturday ( 20.@@ 30 p.m. / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) at cup winner Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund .
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti must also do without the BV@@ B on David Al@@ aba .
the Italian confirmed on Friday .
&quot; in addition , the Mun@@ ch@@ men Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six months , An@@ cel@@ otti has held responsible for the physical condition and the lack of balance in the game of his team . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti and added : &quot; the most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , it was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official play of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the crew is ready .
&quot; we want to play intellig@@ ently , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who is expecting a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football @-@ heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans under their spell .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , distributed the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
wander@@ ing in the Harz mountains to a star
&quot; in the resin , the nation @-@ wide first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; is to emerge . &quot;
&quot; this is planned by the &quot; &quot; Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg &quot; &quot; ( Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg ) . &quot;
there is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; comes to meet the information needs of many resin @-@ go@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
the members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 the association plans &quot; &quot; easily accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; &quot; in the Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; inqu@@ ire into St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the panels is to be complemented by internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting location choice . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the Star@@ Path train will be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star path , the viewers experience a lot of worth knowing , for example about the physics of the individual stars , &quot; the association declared . &quot;
&quot; in addition , they learned why stars had different colors or why a star lit more strongly than another , even though it was much further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation you can find a selected star and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; since 2014 , the association has been running the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Nature Conservation , the site in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
&quot; frequently from there , the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy can be seen clearly with naked eye . &quot;
&quot; in the Uni @-@ Stadt , there has been something similar to the planned planetary path since 2003 on the initiative of the Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ hard d Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to the H@@ ain@@ berg and the observ@@ atory - as well as an &quot; ex@@ tr@@ ater@@ restrial &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden ( municipality of Glei@@ chen ) with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to d@@ warf @-@ planet de@@ mot@@ ed to the d@@ warf planet - are positioned exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a sphere of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the sun , which is exactly 75 metres away , measures 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the total distance of the planetary path is about four kilometers .
&quot; while the light from sun up to the Plu@@ to takes about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the universe .
&quot; the march to the next fixed star , however , would last for half a year . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time , discuss a possible show@@ down &quot;
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms in ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated World Bo@@ xing Council lightweight champion , went down the corridor to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko to the World Bo@@ xing Organisation Super @-@ Sus@@ pension Champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory by unanim@@ ous decision about the former four divisions world champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both comb@@ at@@ ants are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und list . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia stretched out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , Champion ? &quot;
&quot; I wish you a lot of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 p.m. on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the couple posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former spring weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered . &quot;
&quot; I grew up for Bron@@ er &#91; on 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I want to come down to lightweight .
and he must move to light weights &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that &apos;s what the fans are asking for .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxes need this fight . &quot;
&quot; Kli@@ mas asked if it should be on pay @-@ per @-@ view , part of a strategy that Lom@@ ach@@ enko must fight with a 135 @-@ pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also participated in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell on 23 September . &quot;
&quot; this fight could take place in pay @-@ per @-@ view mode , because all fans were asked for it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said , and later pressed out to fight for the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he gu@@ esses Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday battle . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko believed in the generous praise for Gar@@ cia and said he thinks he &apos;d see the three @-@ war champion from River@@ side &quot; very slowly , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted the co @-@ off . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said that the focus was to show impact strength , then boxes . &quot;
both said they could feel the momentum that arose for their own struggle .
this is the fight that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I am more than happy to work on it , &quot; &quot; said Gar@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said , &quot; &quot; I have waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after the tire board
&quot; in the event of an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control over his vehicle shortly before the connection point of the market . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where he sur@@ rendered and then remained on the roof in the green stri@@ pe . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were severely injured in the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the injured due to the ambul@@ ance service , the A@@ 7 was blocked in the direction north for about an hour , following the traffic on the left side of the road to the accident site . &quot;
&quot; For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; &quot; tr@@ ash chain works better &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 at the season op@@ ener against Braunschweig , and@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the optimisation of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result too , would not have been the two opponents of the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; these were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; &quot; says the def@@ enders of Fort@@ una Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the three @-@ dimensional chain should also be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a blast , the For@@ tun@@ ers don &apos;t want to catch up anymore . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
&quot; Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in preparation with the three @-@ tier , than with the four @-@ chain @-@ chain . &quot;
&quot; yet I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el says , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , &quot; because we have just been in the tr@@ inity on the half @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gi@@ ß@@ el@@ mann players who can build well , &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we can even better harmon@@ ise and do not make so many ab@@ err@@ ations in the construction . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann is also driving to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but if you can talk about a mis@@ match from a mis@@ chi@@ ev@@ ous start , don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; &quot; said Hoffmann . &quot;
&quot; but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a good season op@@ ener . &quot;
his trainer wanted to know nothing about this .
&quot; I only judge the start of the season only after six to eight seasons , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who would not like to speak of an advantage over Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim had to be cancelled due to a storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season with a home game , &quot; &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit fres@@ her since they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una versus a bud@@ ding favor@@ ites in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know as 100 per cent where they are currently standing , &quot; &quot; says the inner def@@ enders of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , the guests from the Rhin@@ eland serve as an easy favorite on Sunday in the encounter at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we sweep them away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ ness , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose record is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no team in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga , which you have to beat from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as Head coach . &quot;
&quot; to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t , arrogan@@ t . &quot;
and so Funk@@ el does not want to experience his players on Sunday in any case .
new results of the Swedish asylum application tests published
&quot; the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , undergoing a new method for assessing their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started conducting the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age , after the Swedish Migration Service ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; up to now , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et has sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 trials to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
ei@@ ghty percent ( 2002 ) were evaluated as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency judged that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion that the person &quot; may &quot; may be under 18 years of age . &quot;
tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results are steady in recent months . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t see a big difference in statistics of the past few months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; &quot; he said to the magazine &quot; &quot; The Local . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years does not imply that the asylum seek@@ er has lied over his age .
&quot; in May , the agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said there were 4@@ 42 cases stating that the requested person was 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the newspaper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det submitted the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , in which X @-@ ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , was also critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
&quot; a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later than usually through pu@@ ber@@ ty . &quot;
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
to judge the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we can &apos;t say it safe , we should not do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the newspaper Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson from the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; &quot; generally , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case , this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the east entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good in time , it &apos;s running super , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Building Systems and Transport in the government president of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , the works began simultaneously on all three refurb@@ ishment @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the end of the building is scheduled for October and Lei@@ cht is sure that the schedule is respected .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted arch bridge made of concrete , which is covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges lead over Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were erected in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.@@ 60 meters long . &quot;
&quot; the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach is now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1,@@ 30 metre wide and seven tons of heavy so @-@ called bridge cap . &quot;
&quot; this is an edge for@@ tification , which is also used as an operating mode . &quot;
a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge can be used on Friday at the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian walk@@ way will run .
&quot; the special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridges .
special finger tips have required the laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable where many companies are connected .
local residents were informed about the project in advance of the work .
&quot; in addition , fish and cra@@ y@@ fish had to be f@@ ished initially . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the her@@ mitage in the direction of Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light lane . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach town entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is completely closed . &quot;
the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 euros .
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter protest with German potato salad
&quot; it is not so common that parties move on one strand , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together what else is difficult to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the district @-@ day volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grün@@ e , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , left ) belong to a broad alliance , which appears peaceful on this day , because the Af@@ D invites in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle R@@ ond@@ ell to the &quot; big election campaign &quot; according to the poster . &quot;
&quot; and well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , who together with Alexander Gau@@ land form the leading duo for the Bundestag election on September 24 , and vice @-@ president Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event don &apos;t want to listen to the Af@@ D @-@ lern , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel is colorful . &quot;
&quot; originally , the city @-@ picnic was planned under the motto &quot; All at one table &quot; on the fountain square , but is now taking place in the parking lot below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , President of the Forum One World and one of the authorit@@ ative organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there are music and lots of food , among them a &quot; ancient German potato salad , which also the Af@@ D could easily eat , &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes of the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Eifel reported that he took care of such an event and got the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf had first asked in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there are not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so now the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a beautiful event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the right people &apos;s right , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; this is also done : around 8@@ pm there is a band for entertainment at the R@@ ond@@ ell@@ forec@@ platz , in the Stadthalle various speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ president Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; in the hall there are about 200 listeners who are waiting for the top candidate for the Bundestag election , Alice Wei@@ der , and the deputy head of the Federal President , Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; the Af@@ D event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there it is announced shortly after 21 : 00 . &quot;
the police can move - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sts Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher Monastery Concer@@ ts Tom@@ orrow , Sunday , at 20 o &apos;clock in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with Bulgarian trump@@ eter Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or even &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have won solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
so Pet@@ kov is solo trump@@ eter at the prestigious Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo trumpet of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both combine the desire not only to cross the borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music , &quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds together with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz musician N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free games blend into a fascinating total art work . &quot;
this core part of the program was premi@@ ered only this spring with a huge success in Freiburg .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram has written it especially for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acoustics is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about her bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; &quot; &quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives . &quot;
&quot; but I want to try out everything , &quot; Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart is completely open about her bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; when I bite into grilled cheese , I think : &apos; Oh that &apos;s cool , what &apos;s next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the most famous relationship between Hollywood stars was that of their &quot; &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who finally dealt bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin insur@@ es vis @-@ à @-@ vis the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I fell in love with everyone I &apos;ve done . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; &quot; I have always lived and seriously believed Du@@ alism . &quot;
so it has never confused or hin@@ dered me .
I didn &apos;t like it to be taken seriously .
&quot; according to &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; &quot; she especially suffered from the school@@ days when she liked to dress like a boy : &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven told me the children , I &apos;d look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in particular , they don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to keep yourself in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me . &quot;
&quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself before the whole public . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of West Virginia announced that he changes the party
&quot; the democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening at a rally with President Tru@@ mp that he would change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the Democrats have taken away from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with lots of prayers and a lot of re@@ thinking ... today I will tell you as inhabitants of West Virginia , I can &apos;t help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the re@@ public@@ ans , &quot; &quot; Justice added . &quot;
as a trainer I would say it &apos;s time to play another game .
Mr Tru@@ mp promised a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points , and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton . &quot;
&quot; justice , which is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and inherited a coal business from his father .
it is worth $ 1.@@ 59 billion .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued a statement on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; &quot; the Party change by Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow for a Democratic Party that would rather deter us from working to make our country great again . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement of Gover@@ nor Justice is only the final rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is not able to find a positive , unanim@@ ous message , &quot; said R@@ NC president Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; honest &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal
&quot; the world leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious ap@@ ology from Russia to a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed again in sports . &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics chief D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during the IA@@ AF Conference on the eve of the Ath@@ le@@ tics World Championships that the exile of his country was correct from the sport and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all athletes who were caught away with competitions gold and silver medals . &quot;
&quot; despite his comments , the IA@@ AF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) found evidence of state @-@ funded dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to re@@ porters . &quot;
the whole council and the whole congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
&quot; Co@@ E said he was also &quot; &quot; pleased &quot; &quot; that Russia accepts the criteria for its re@@ introduction . &quot;
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the next few months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle always was that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships that start on Friday in London , following the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral players . &quot;
&quot; the head of the IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must meet some of the criteria for re @-@ setting . &quot;
&quot; drug tests are still insufficient and forbidden trainers are still free , &quot; &quot; he said in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
mour@@ ning ceremony for soldiers stolen in Mali
&quot; at a funeral service in the northern h@@ ess@@ ischen Frit@@ z@@ lar , around 1000 people of the two were thought of a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security precau@@ tions .
&quot; in order to remain un@@ resolved , Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; they described the two in@@ verse drivers , however , as &quot; &quot; cor@@ onation &quot; &quot; of their profession . &quot;
&quot; we bow down to the highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ h@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen came to life on Wednesday a week ago in Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and led by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr in the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er cathedral Sankt Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the members of the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; after that , the funeral service began in the circle of the family , closest friends , from representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr as well as politics . &quot;
&quot; among them were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) , and the general inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the sad@@ dens laid down roses , the relatives were arm in arms to the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; before the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers followed the ceremony on a canvas . &quot;
Minister of Defence of the Le@@ yen called the inver@@ ted soldiers as &quot; highly decorated &quot; and sm@@ ashed .
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann built the flight operation of the fighter helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tig@@ ers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers belong , said : &quot; &quot; if this occupation could not turn the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; doubts about the UN mission in Mali , Minister of Justice , did not show this : the deployment was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of great importance &quot; for a country that we are only separated by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; after the funeral service , the coff@@ ins were brought out of the cathedral . &quot;
&quot; when and where they are buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik doesn &apos;t want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , wants to be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that divided the König@@ shaus on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
&quot; the Queen had agreed to her husband &apos;s decision , and said it further in the message . &quot;
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
in 2016 he retired and also put off the title of &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper . &quot;
&quot; since Hen@@ rik has not received the title and function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 year old will ultimately be , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he did not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ tra@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cratic family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in London . &quot;
he worked in the French embassy on the Th@@ ames .
&quot; during his later wife , Prince Hen@@ rik had a hard time in his almost 50 @-@ year reign with the Dan@@ es . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik wrote about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was fluctu@@ ating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia Tob@@ acco and those in Germany had the reputation of being the brand of society critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be happy with this position and not ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants a fast re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP ahead of possible majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a swift re @-@ election of the country , however , he does not want to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the Parliament adopted the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising res@@ ignation of a Green de@@ pu@@ ties from their Land@@ tag fraction in Lower Saxony , the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) fell into a severe crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the country election , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its tight @-@ vote majority in parliament to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Gre@@ ens Euro MP El@@ ke T@@ westen combined her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the 2018 election in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she declared on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his Group to take it up .
&quot; thus CD@@ U and F@@ DP together had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony State Congress , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the relationship has been revers@@ ed .
the new parliament will be elected regular on 14 January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green provincial government must now decide whether or not to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , believes that the Land@@ tag resol@@ ves its self @-@ resolution as soon as possible . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the Parliament el@@ ects confidence to the Prime Minister and el@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our Constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these possibilities must be checked legally clean@@ ly , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; one will discuss all the questions in peace , if they are legally examined properly . &quot;
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ west@@ ens step &quot; but something cur@@ i@@ os . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a pendant of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens demanded the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their parliament mandate .
&quot; we assume , of course , that they have retained their land mandate , which it has received over the green country list , with immediate effect , &quot; said the president Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; s &amp; D Group president , Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; we deeply regret the decision of El@@ ke T@@ westen . &quot;
she deliberately decided not to lead a pron@@ unciation in the group .
&quot; even in the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxony MP El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the behaviour of the former Green de@@ pu@@ ties in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate , but also the betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; wrote the German Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Parliament .
the exit of the west costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; the politi@@ cian is &quot; in her dish@@ on@@ est vanity and in her fru@@ stration her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is a sc@@ andal that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony carries this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to beat out political capital .
Dutch CD@@ U leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to include El@@ ke T@@ westen in the CD@@ U .
&quot; the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , spur@@ red v@@ ests to fal@@ si@@ fy the outcome of the 2013 Land@@ tag election with a personal career . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was then in front of the SPD strongest force , SPD and Green had a very thin majority of a vote in the parliament . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses poll@@ uted eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves ?
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is talking and answering the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) in the interview .
&quot; Mr Schmidt , How can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ gro@@ war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information about the affected eggs @-@ bat@@ ches . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if , after all , what we are currently aware of , a health hazard is practically excluded . &quot;
now Al@@ di takes over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since announcement . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has as well the manufacturers concerned to ensure that the sold products are traffic @-@ capable and harmless to health .
&quot; if the residue levels of 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg are exceeded in the case of eggs , these are non @-@ transfer@@ able . &quot;
un@@ loaded eggs can however be sold and consumed .
this time the factories are not to blame .
do production plants and consumers sit in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the current state of knowledge , the production plants do not meet any direct guilt . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must expect economic damages due to suspected illegal practices . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are too few inspec@@ tors in the case of emergency . &quot;
is it only missing on the staff or on the conclu@@ sive competence ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; however , the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out by 100 percent . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consistent education of such events and hand@@ ing over to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made clear that I expect incomplete information from the responsible authorities .
is the regular alarm mis@@ m necessary for food sc@@ and@@ als ?
consumers have the right to buy only safe and safe food .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly ou@@ tra@@ ged . &quot;
&quot; by means of the pan@@ eled agent , manufacturers , dealers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the un@@ lawful use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
&quot; on all levels , it has to be worked consistently and with high pressure . &quot;
I expect from all the competent authorities that the facts are quickly and completely elu@@ ci@@ dated .
how to impact the financial rules of football on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ imp@@ eded spending of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; there will be any consequences for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main from the UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that over@@ sees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A mean that PS@@ G has to prove , at some point , that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar has been financed without major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to purchase the Brazi@@ li@@ ans from its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s move to France .
&quot; with security , PS@@ G can make the money loose in order to sign N@@ ey@@ mar and bring him to a gal@@ axy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich royal family of Qatar . &quot;
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but have to counter@@ act legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break @-@ even point in their football @-@ related business . &quot;
FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini after his election to the UEF@@ A President in 2007 .
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs , which had taken enormous debts in their quest for success , effectively dec@@ eive and ris@@ ked to ruin themselves when banks or propriet@@ ors with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitoring its losses . &quot;
the change meant that the business model that Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - become a harder issue .
&quot; during the current three @-@ year FF@@ P period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million . &quot;
&quot; and although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , its UEF@@ A successor Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in continues to sc@@ are away from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although the PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause from N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the invoice on the duration of his contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the proceeds can be expelled for the next five years amounting to EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 has hit the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the har@@ dest sanctions . &quot;
&quot; the PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
&quot; UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that might try to out@@ wit their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies , associated with the owners of a club . &quot;
&quot; while a Catalan company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , the UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
this was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the sponsor of the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments could come to N@@ ey@@ mar on payments by the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have disputed that N@@ ey@@ mar WM ambass@@ adors will become and such a manoeu@@ vre for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators to be easy to figure out .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that the UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to take into account any attempt to circum@@ vent the rules .
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G over N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , announ@@ cing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation . &quot;
they talked about the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the last published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 achieved a profit of more than 10 million euros with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s arrival a blessing for sponsor@@ ing , merchan@@ dising and jer@@ sey sales . &quot;
the association expects that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players to see , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s &apos;s move by claiming that PS@@ G would hurt the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS with regard to Qatar &apos;s last ownership of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; arsen@@ al manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sports ty@@ co@@ on , shares the reservations of La League against a state financed by an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; once a country has an association , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect fair@@ play because one can have different ways or have different interests , if a country has such a big actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss Life is looking for a new supplier
&quot; in recent years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y board chocolate has produced cho@@ col@@ ates for Swiss . &quot;
&quot; now , the close cooperation is on the ver@@ ge of a possible end : the airline re@@ writes the order . &quot;
Swiss @-@ Spe@@ aker Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed on request of the news agency s@@ da an appropriate report of the newspaper &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; from Friday .
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokes@@ woman . &quot;
approximately 17 million small white @-@ white packed sho@@ ck@@ boards spread to 14 grams a year before landing to the passengers .
the Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .
&quot; according to industry insi@@ der , the order volume in accordance with &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; estimates from 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a sho@@ oter maker .
&quot; as many candidates do in the new tender , the Swiss does not want to betra@@ y the Swiss . &quot;
but only Swiss manufacturers are eligible for this .
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y wants to make an effort to renew the Treaty on the spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not achiev@@ able for an opinion . &quot;
chocolate boards distribute Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; prior to signing a contract with Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut had delivered the chocolate tablets in collaboration with Hu@@ g . &quot;

nostal@@ gia goes to &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is at the same time nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 @-@ er years , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 before their stars , like Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd went to bigger things . &quot;
as a cultural arti@@ fact it is equally par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories .
but as fran@@ chise it feels like the time would be scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; was surprisingly good , not just because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a promising nose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by sti@@ cking to the core of the g@@ ags - actors of middle age play awesome children , who will grow - nevertheless they managed to win the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es back . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes much more to the pedi@@ gree principle , including a riff on the Stal@@ ker movies of the 90 @-@ er years like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le &quot; ( &quot; The Hand that schau@@ k@@ elt &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; one point rum@@ mage a character through an Apple Power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot; &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has still not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn &apos;t lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
&quot; and there is another mad @-@ vi@@ cious plot , included in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) , who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well @-@ successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) . &quot;
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is a lot of fun to see the etern@@ ally young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ pp@@ enb@@ art of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former big @-@ man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s the moments of random ma@@ dness that could spark this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series , until he achieves what I consider as his logical conclusion : &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater , &quot; whose last scene will show the band how they will visit the movie premiere of &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; &quot; on Amazon now re@@ members a different kind of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; &quot; The Americans &quot; , &quot; the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde &quot; and even &quot; G@@ LO@@ W &quot; with its East @-@ against @-@ West w@@ rest@@ ling icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka with Rh@@ ys Thomas as a director is to be a found TV show : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est , who fight for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the road of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard @-@ car@@ rot Greg@@ ory and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose dialo@@ gues from Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also a detailed producer ) and Joseph Gordon @-@ Lev@@ itt are du@@ bbed in English . &quot;
it is an ingeni@@ ous idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice G@@ ags to see ( the police spends the time looking at chess on TV as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of the famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Fin@@ de the voice out &apos; . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; comm@@ its itself so much for the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan &apos;s mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .
&quot; with six long episodes , it moves away and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who has been reduced to a lesser length , could better deliver his ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Greg@@ ory and I@@ os@@ ef continue to visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imag@@ inary communist audience is that Western culture can make everything for food for a money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with theirs .
blow against Dru@@ gs Ma@@ fia in the Land
the police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart . &quot;
15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warran@@ ts against them .
&quot; in addition , officials accounted for large amounts of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms , and several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
two people were arrested at the time of the same ra@@ ids in Italy .
&quot; against the two susp@@ ects Itali@@ ans , there were German warran@@ ts of arrest . &quot;
the two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .
in the action Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were employed . &quot;
&quot; the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office has been investigating the organized drug trafficking in southern Germany . &quot;
&quot; between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo , there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the large @-@ scale deployment was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo on Wednesday morning . &quot;
the aim of the investigation was primarily Italian nation@@ als with a close relationship to the Italian ma@@ fia .
&quot; even a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
manner compla@@ ins large gaps in the for@@ eigner &apos;s register
&quot; according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany has significant short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to some serious mis@@ decisions in asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner for Refu@@ gee Management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , drew attention to large gaps in the immigration centre register . &quot;
&quot; in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , defects in the data recorded there may result in &quot; &quot; serious mis@@ decisions &quot; , &quot; warned in an analysis published by the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to the information , ten million people with foreign nation@@ als are registered in the register , including around 5.@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign nation@@ als in Germany .
&quot; because the data were not adequately cared for , the data quality has not been good in parts so far . &quot;
&quot; in individual cases , data from 1921 were found , &quot; of people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register . &quot;
&quot; incorrect data input can slow down revers@@ al processes , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics of sufficient tax@@ pa@@ yers , EU citizens are also included , who would not have to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; such false declarations , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient tax@@ pa@@ yers , &quot; says the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has obviously begun to send refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children if they are there . &quot;
&quot; this emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the paper states that &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF conduct such procedures &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - in Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 this was practically no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on site . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , it is responsible for refugees from the EU state to reach them first . &quot;
&quot; if a Mig@@ rant travels to another EU country , this state can send it back to the rei@@ sel@@ and . &quot;
&quot; now the office now writes : &quot; &quot; meanwhile , the recording capacity for families with under@@ age children in Italy has increased considerably . &quot;
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of family guarantees .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( EC@@ rt@@ HR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back there as part of the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the Left Ques@@ tion@@ ist in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Jel@@ p@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; &quot; families with children are threatening un@@ lawful detention conditions and a threat to child welfare due to the lack of the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second @-@ best result achieved
a total of 220 litres of blood of people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach already provided the blood donation service for other people .
&quot; at least of the twelve citizens , who were honored on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Jürgen Gre@@ ule , who now has 100 donations in the meantime shared 50 litres of blood . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the meeting of the Municipal Council , the church hon@@ ours the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is laid out and we ap@@ plau@@ d the don@@ ors respect , which provide their blood for strangers , yet un@@ sel@@ fl@@ ess , &quot; &quot; emphasized mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the district leader of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the preserves are broken down into their constitu@@ ent parts . &quot;
&quot; in this way , three people could benefit from a blood donation . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , corn producers reported about the actions carried out in the spring of Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; said the Order of the DRC . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre house has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Um@@ ber@@ rel were among the multiple don@@ ors and were awarded for 50 donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half as many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pf@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ mmer , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter gave 10 times each 500 milli@@ liters of their life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weak@@ ening of inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase . &quot;
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain &quot; slu@@ gg@@ ish &quot; when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensi@@ fying pressure .
&quot; the policy makers of the Monetary Committee ( M@@ PC ) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , with fewer members growing in this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and to 1.6 % in 2018 and warned that pressure on budget@@ ary income would continue , although inflation expected to rise to almost 3 % in the fall . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest increases would be needed to cur@@ b the inflation of the Bre@@ x@@ it and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
the members also voted to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic stimulus package issued one year ago after the Bre@@ x@@ it .
&quot; it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks as of next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; the Bank said : &quot; &quot; in the central forecast of M@@ PC the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak short @-@ term , as pressure on the real income of households continues to be bur@@ dened by consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the rate of interest , it repeated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be necessary to cool inflation and a &quot; slightly bigger &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets are forec@@ asting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and one further in 2020 .
&quot; however , the Bank stressed that increases would be &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
it has retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .
&quot; the pound dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and fell by 0.4 % to 1,@@ 11 Euro . &quot;
the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures have damp@@ ened the rising expectations for interest increase and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .
&quot; growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it is likely to recover slightly after the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor enh@@ ancements , since the tigh@@ tening will be worse before it becomes better . &quot;
&quot; she added that in the coming years monetary policy could not &quot; &quot; prevent the in@@ comes from in@@ comes &quot; , &quot; but she added that wages are &quot; &quot; clear &quot; &quot; at the end of their three @-@ year forecasts . &quot;
&quot; the economy is also boo@@ sted by rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak Po@@ und , which will compensate for a portion of lower consumer spending . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % in August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the decline of the fund . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy .
&quot; prior to the Bank &apos;s final decision on interest rates , the call for interest rates rose , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three political decision @-@ makers increased to 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation has dropped from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % in June , although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said the excess in proportion to its target of 2 % was to be attributed to the weak Po@@ und .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , Director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the len@@ ders are lou@@ dly looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing de@@ cks exp@@ ire and the new mort@@ g@@ ages finish , and many with toll free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
&quot; N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) to prescri@@ be controversial HIV drug , 10,000 people &quot;
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that prior to sexual intercourse , pre @-@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now supplied by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial , after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by N@@ HS England chief Simon St@@ ev@@ ens as an &quot; important new intervention , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable people to register and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection risk .
taking pre@@ p prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection .
such medications can be taken every day or as early as two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexu@@ als and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; suitable participants are identified in clinics that agree to the study including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV @-@ status is not well known by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
people living in England and registered with a GP can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .
the program will sign £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive purchase .
&quot; the study aims to evaluate the full potential of pre@@ p by collecting , recording and implementing clinical evidence in a large scale . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should complement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in cop@@ ing with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , if it is targeted towards vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , President of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; priority must now be that the study will be done quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV will be left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Health Minister , said : &quot; &quot; the start of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living the big life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former ban@@ ker with a passion for real estate , fell into Ear@@ ls Court apartment in 2014 by a big Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge house . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne hasn &apos;t packed and sold her pockets .
&quot; before that I lived with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge in a much bigger room , &quot; Jo@@ anne says . &quot;
I looked for something comparable to my price .
&quot; I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court , and it had the same high ceilings . &quot;
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Jo@@ anne closet space and an mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my requirement , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed of Er@@ fan Az@@ adi from Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two spaces above each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively , to solve the issue . &quot;
&quot; the steel works are quite complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other , without having to bend . &quot;
&quot; it was not just about building a simple platform , but creating the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us overlooks the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ ille lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light . &quot;
&quot; at both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow it to work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window in another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units provide space for all the cutlery and j@@ ars of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering went inside , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the steel reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF @-@ door . &quot;
&quot; it is important , so it is very easy to slide when you push the door . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size . &quot;
&quot; here , they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical outlets in the walls . &quot;
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard into something completely amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave them . &quot;
brothers fight for a 500 million US dollar property empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate @-@ empire Victori@@ as worth more than 500 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
Paul wanted to reti@@ re from family business since 2014 but a sharp dispute about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
there the family founded West@@ co jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .
it was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999 .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lu@@ tis now includes offices in the city rum , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping centers in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her late father Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; the main operator and the domin@@ ating personality &quot; described in the De Lu@@ tis family - about two @-@ thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul , about one third . &quot;
a court case states that this means that Col@@ in &apos;s property has a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul has a value of $ 17@@ 6 million .
the division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the departments proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the Supreme Court &apos;s first hearing took place . &quot;
&quot; the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but re@@ jects Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it , which was submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage dict@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; costs increase in the event , with hundreds of pages with Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , among them Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and from both parties held law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated Mil@@ ky Bars and Deli@@ kat@@ essen business from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early 1970 &apos;s . &quot;
they used the security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property in which Col@@ in opened the first jeans shop of the family .
Col@@ in says that he started West co there when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lu@@ tis Group , and Col@@ in claims that Mark has paid $ 10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in kept back very much , although he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography from the year 2015 of Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of television stars . &quot;
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
only Col@@ in replied by SMS to say &quot; I really can &apos;t say much &quot; because the case is in front of the courts .
&quot; it is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw up our sur@@ name by the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
in mid @-@ 2016 Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands .
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute , &quot; &quot; he said and added that he &quot; &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot;

Tru@@ mp &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the President &apos;s media abst@@ in@@ ence .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly may actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the White House &apos;s new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House met at his first working day with leading employees , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp White House , which he wanted to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the President . &quot;
Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would obtain good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame Tru@@ mp by monitoring his media diet .
&quot; President Tru@@ mp &apos;s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; when candidate Tru@@ mp was upset because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; said the former election campaign , Sam N@@ un@@ berg , in February . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keeping tru@@ mp &apos;s Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaig@@ ners , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption includes a steady lob@@ b@@ ying . &quot;
okay .
&quot; but the idea that Tru@@ mp &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control , &quot; is ridi@@ culous . &quot;
maybe these campaign officials don &apos;t know what we do not know - that Tru@@ mps T@@ we@@ ets would have even more combus@@ tible stuff without their intervention .
we will probably never know about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; if his collabor@@ ators have made it a few times to keep anger from him , then their efforts have paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently prevented Tru@@ mp Contro@@ ll@@ sen .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting tru@@ mp material that may promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co - dealing with this story - reported in May about the pre@@ dile@@ ction of the advis@@ ers , the president for strategic reasons du@@ bi@@ ous information . &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative press sections , especially those with sham@@ eful le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; exactly this happened at the end of February when someone mali@@ ci@@ ously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by Got@@ News@@ .com , the website of the Internet provo@@ cat@@ eur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of le@@ aks &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for sh@@ kan@@ en , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has given wrong accus@@ ations in the past and re@@ vo@@ ke her . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking staff about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary @-@ General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , &quot; tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paper@@ work which tru@@ mp has received . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most cov@@ eted criminals receive post by Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and raised . &quot;
the police across Europe sent in this summer ( virtual ) postcards to dangerous criminals on the run .
&quot; since the addresses of the requested heavy criminals are not known , references from the population will be hoped and asked . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Euro@@ pol reported on the promotion that follows the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; advent calendar from the winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences had shown that many fle@@ eting to the destinations were hiding , which was called Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have put together 21 postcards of searched criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ er@@ ost@@ wanted has been viewed more than 2.5 million times . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online spec@@ s have been captured so far , at least eleven of them due to evidence after the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire &apos;s Series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home owners of the West Mid@@ lands are back with some determined travelers on the foot of the war , who negotiated a tren@@ ch from the community to rec@@ laim a field in front of their man@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; travellers have par@@ ked their 20 caravan on a field outside a well @-@ to @-@ do road of Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; &quot; Million@@ aire &quot; &quot; row . &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of transpor@@ ters after they were ki@@ cked out only in May , but without being deter@@ red by a tren@@ ch excav@@ ated by the Council in order to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; the angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said that it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot; &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones onto the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement it , as it was useless when dealing with the problem . &quot;
&quot; the travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back . &quot;
&quot; more arrived yesterday evening , probably even more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my common tax , if the Council cannot even stop it . &quot;
&quot; a local people who didn &apos;t want to be named said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , just to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
&quot; the numbers have increased this time , and one even saw a horse in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman for Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work together with the police of Soli@@ h@@ ul@@ ls . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; in order to support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case .
Bir@@ k@@ enhof will be Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
from the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise becomes .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently being renovated and will be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closing of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambiente operating company l@@ t@@ d. on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenue from the tourist tax . &quot;
&quot; in the fall of 2014 , in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district , the hotel building was offered as collective accommodation , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
the decision was not un@@ disputed at that time in the Municipal Council .
&quot; but above all , Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor Julian Os@@ s@@ wald defended the site of the hotel , and at that time he spoke of serious interest in the house . &quot;
he should keep right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer with headquarters in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three @-@ star Plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; hot Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; at the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof there have been building sh@@ utt@@ les in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renov@@ ations are to be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings partly broken down , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still a lot to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice hotel , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are built . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; beautiful &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer expresses . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment . &quot;
&quot; you will not be able to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already on an up@@ scale city level , Sch@@ erer gets stressed . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business@@ men will feel at ease in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already held talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourism Director Michael Kr@@ ause , so sha@@ ver . &quot;
the city &apos;s ideas were identical with those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; after the amount of investment required , Thomas Sch@@ erer does not want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; just under a million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the exterior installations are also brought to the fore , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard there is a large terrace , which is accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia @-@ Aff@@ air : us Special Off@@ ers Sub@@ mit Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia @-@ Aff@@ air around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , special educ@@ ator Robert Mu@@ eller is said to have used a so @-@ called grand jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the Board has taken up the work , wrote the &quot; Wall Street Journal &quot; on appeal to persons entrusted with the matter . &quot;
the paper counted the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller expanded and intensified its investigations .
the radio station CN@@ N reported that there were already first charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Tru@@ mp &apos;s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .
U.S. secret services have been acc@@ using the Krem@@ lin for a long time to pur@@ ge into the 2016 presidential election campaign .
Mu@@ eller studied whether there were agreements between the Tru@@ mp election team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigations , several men are to stand who acted as advis@@ ors to the re@@ public@@ ans in the election campaign . &quot;
&quot; according to report , Mu@@ eller also examined more and more Tru@@ mps as a private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the special investig@@ ator Tru@@ mp was personally involved in the centre and accused the accus@@ ation whether the President could possibly hin@@ der the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand J@@ uries is to check this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to be charged .
Grand J@@ uries are therefore also called the In@@ dict@@ ments of the In@@ dict@@ ment .
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when they are larger and controversial . &quot;
the procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .
the Panel can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons for the interro@@ gation under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N , pre @-@ inv@@ itations have already been issued , which revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
those who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement and said it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
next to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. Tru@@ mps also served as advis@@ er and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his official election campaign Paul Man@@ a@@ fort .
&quot; on Thursday evening , legal experts reported that Mu@@ eller would not in@@ timi@@ date himself in his work and that he should be quick to act fast in his work . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of new revelations , the President made a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia story is a total invention , &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
the subject gives the Democrats an opportunity to &quot; feel good &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about .
his Special Ad@@ visor T@@ y Cob@@ b stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the insertion of a Grand Jury .
&quot; but I usually work in secret , he stressed . &quot;
the White House fears every action that accelerated the work of the special agent in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
former FBI chief James Com@@ ey told three times that not against the President .
&quot; one has no reason to assume that something has changed , it said in the explanation . &quot;
&quot; however , Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp Com@@ ey had fired . &quot;
&quot; because of this accus@@ ation , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp had become loud , he would im@@ pe@@ de the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in June , Com@@ ey issued a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to set up the investigations against the former national security advis@@ er Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure because of the investigation .
&quot; following the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees . &quot;
this triggered spec@@ ulations on whether he wanted to release Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller .
&quot; unlike an independent special agent of the Congress , like in the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair about the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the urge of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
several sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step .
&quot; on Thursday , two groups of republi@@ can and democratic sen@@ ators presented leg@@ is@@ lators on Thursday that the special agent could not be dismissed so easily . &quot;
Antar@@ cti@@ ca : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the West Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg from the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has detached from the Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s . &quot;
this was divided by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred We@@ gener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sus of more than 1 tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres of large col@@ os@@ sus is now driving to the north and will probably need two , three years until it is mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice giant that researchers have registered over the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to human beings .
&quot; as far as climate change has played a role in the abor@@ tion of the ic@@ e@@ berg , research is unclear . &quot;
&quot; however , there have been a series of unusual break@@ downs in the region for about 30 years , writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background . &quot;
&quot; according to many researchers , this could be related to global warming . &quot;
the now broken col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s .
Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s flo@@ ats on the sea and is fed by big glaci@@ ers .
&quot; thus , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly . &quot;
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the equilibrium of wa@@ xes and ab@@ ort was disturbed a few years ago . &quot;
A@@ WI @-@ researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen writes a complete hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e .
&quot; there is a good talk about the fact that the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ture is in danger , as the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice sheet is under tension and can be dis@@ integrated if a piece breaks down at a key point . &quot;
melting of Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s and Eis@@ berg does not increase sea level since they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting .
&quot; however , the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase the level of sea level , but only to a lesser extent , the British research project for the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) writes . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ s is the fourth @-@ largest shelf of Antar@@ cti@@ ca . &quot;
&quot; at the transition from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the iron sign is now in a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y from British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the most serious retreat since the beginning of records , &quot; he also affir@@ med . &quot;
&quot; scientists have argued that the Lar@@ sen C Sch@@ el@@ fei@@ ture will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coinci@@ de , &quot; said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will take decades .
&quot; even if these researchers don &apos;t bring back the demo@@ lition of this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg to climate change , there have been a lot of melting in the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula in recent decades . &quot;
this long skirt of Antar@@ cti@@ ca stretches in the direction of South America .
&quot; according to the research program British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has decreased by 28@@ ,000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the increase in temperature contributed to the decline .
the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has war@@ med up around three degrees in the past 50 years and count towards the areas where the temperature is fastest .
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to step out of the employers &apos; association to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; just before the summer break , 41 new jobs have been pushed through in the administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have their first working day behind them . &quot;
the teachers in the circle are apparently very much sought after .
around 6@@ 20 applications were registered for the places to be announced this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; at present , there are still 50 un@@ occupied places in the circle of M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the request of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for human resources and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term requirements for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application shortage . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should ori@@ ent itself internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for clim@@ bers and involve an education campaign , call for CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se well officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
the speech is of a ver@@ itable &quot; competition of public employers . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a high number of employees , who leave the service for disease or age , come out of the service . &quot;
&quot; so high time to act , so that no more jobs will remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Pe@@ op@@ les , president of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the common request with his party . &quot;
&quot; he was already worried about a bad surprise in the circle of the working day , when he questioned the staff cost @-@ caps publicly and amazed the remaining parties . &quot;
&quot; people want all possibilities to be verified , which enable a withdrawal from the local employers &apos; association . &quot;
&quot; if we don &apos;t come to a satisfying solution at short notice , the circular management with the trade unions - perhaps in co @-@ operation with the county @-@ related cities - should asp@@ ire to a Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; &quot; said Pe@@ op@@ les . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for public service . &quot;
&quot; sal@@ aries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money are only available when one changes to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Protection Act . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , by increasing numbers of asylum seekers , Land@@ rat Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy har@@ dens the tone of NGO migrants &apos; lif@@ ebo@@ ats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat of the German Relief Organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; because their crew worked effectively with traffi@@ ckers in a manner that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration .
&quot; the aid organisation , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to speak to the Italian prosec@@ utor Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio in detailed alle@@ gations . &quot;
&quot; for us , the saving of human life remains our top priority . so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; said the organization in an opinion on the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can only evaluate all accus@@ ations that are currently being raised , after collecting all the information and assessing the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &quot; Youth Ret@@ tet , &quot; the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is presum@@ ed that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which are supplied to them directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go off so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s act , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the occupation is suspected of over@@ seeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the code of conduct , boats such as the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board who over@@ sees their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to adhere to the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable as they would not bring &quot; major changes or disabilities &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
&quot; among those who refuse to sign , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate organisation doctors are without borders ( MS@@ F ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , Minn@@ iti said that the number of migrants who arrived after the emergency measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast@@ guard and cooperation with local may@@ ors bear fruit . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ ker , the &quot; &quot; Berlin out@@ post &quot; &quot; and two guest drivers met in Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate for four days to enjoy tri@@ als and sight@@ se@@ ein@@ gs . &quot;
&quot; for this , three friendly guides were available . &quot;
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and W@@ einf@@ est of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there were view@@ points , partly on towers , of which one could see far above the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were always longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to the Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; again there was a lookout spot at the lookout spot , connected by &quot; flo@@ gged &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days a lot of altitude difference was announced .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refu@@ ges brought welcome breaks . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers breath@@ ed sal@@ ine br@@ ine in the open air inhal@@ atorium . &quot;
Neustadt was also controlled .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometers and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group had met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its very best side - sporty and cul@@ turally . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga equi@@ ps itself for e @-@ sport
&quot; in future , the sport stars are sitting in front of computer consoles , instead of swe@@ ating through the stadium in the wind and weather ? &quot;
&quot; fact : e @-@ Sport has long become a serious business , becoming a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high ga@@ gen included . &quot;
&quot; this has also been recognised by the first federal li@@ ga@@ nations , who are increasingly involved in this area . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sports division in mid @-@ July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
it is certain that there are still several clubs on this train .
&quot; on the next weekend , FIFA World Cup organis@@ es the first Inter@@ active Club World Cup in London , where Gam@@ ers compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven qualified . &quot;
also Robin D@@ utt sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; in particular , real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds that young people still go to the stadium in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones . &quot;
&quot; with prominent electric sports@@ men under contract , one could be more often present on these markets online than just sending the federal budget to Asia once a year . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in the E @-@ sport , computer games such as &quot; League Of Legends , &quot; &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike &quot; or even football simulation FIFA are being challenged at competitive level . &quot;
&quot; as in normal sports , Li@@ gen has long since become established in which the pros are competing against each other . &quot;
&quot; and with the Asian games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it a real sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ atic has long been dealing with the question .
&quot; for Professor at the German Sports College in Cologne , E @-@ Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding , need a quick response . &quot;
&quot; professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console , but also their body and pay attention to the diet . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ rank player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; but the stro@@ mal also sees some problems : &quot; &quot; dop@@ ing is becoming more and more a topic . &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to carry out in online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport failed . &quot;
&quot; positively , the scientist raises the high integr@@ ative effect of e @-@ sport . &quot;
&quot; players are on the go international , that &apos;s like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study by the Del@@ o@@ itte business consultancy and the Federal Association Inter@@ active entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , turnover is expected to exceed 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , that is not enough . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or ice hockey , &quot; write the Del@@ o@@ itte consultant . &quot;
many countries are already in the world .
large markets are Asia and the USA where ex @-@ basketball players Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez are participating in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports .
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher inv@@ ests in the e@@ Sport @-@ Wett@@ erer Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; in Europe , too , things are happening . &quot;
&quot; in a Norwegian school , E @-@ Sport has been introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; according to D@@ utt , the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sports department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany is la@@ gging behind Germany , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B Director R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
only to decay into nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is no longer enough today .
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but to align the company at the same time on the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digital world , &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t cling to it , that everything remains as it always was when it comes to football . &quot;

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the lyrics Con@@ rad Roy
&quot; a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years , because she encouraged her boy@@ friend to commit suicide . &quot;
&quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months behind bars and five years were exposed to prob@@ ation . &quot;
Car@@ ter was sentenced in June for the neg@@ ligent killing of Con@@ rad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and downward pointing eyes , when she was condemned . &quot;
&quot; her actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has not shown any re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that they fully regret .
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz , however , said he did not find out that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness had a significant impact on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ y &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , who said that there is &quot; no day when I don &apos;t lose the loss of my beloved son . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how to deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , in spite of all my pain we will carry for eternity . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother &apos;s wedding or be an ante for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask someone to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy found dead of a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew national attention , after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang yourself up , jump from a building , get up yourself , I don &apos;t know there are many ways , &quot; she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Every@@ thing you need to do is turn off the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said that Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was looking through the death of Roy and ordered that she should profit from the case by any press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
Am@@ anda Kno@@ x belonged to the few who defended Car@@ ter in 2007 for murder of her British room@@ mate in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago .
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves sympathy and help , not imprisonment . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ e : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ecture of FC Bayern
&quot; that Joshua Kim@@ e was allowed to join the Audi Cup as a captain , is not a coincidence . &quot;
the FC Bayern dar@@ es a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation is not damaging there .
&quot; something was different from his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kim@@ e immediately , even though the additional garment was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup of course no Philipp L@@ ahm , and no Manuel Neu@@ er , he made the rush to his arm . &quot;
&quot; the trainer didn &apos;t announce it , &quot; the Con@@ fed @-@ Cup winner told afterwards , after his first use as a Bayern @-@ captain . &quot;
&quot; well , the console could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SS@@ C Naples . &quot;
but the sign from the coach could also indicate Kim@@ e .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year @-@ old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a guide from youth players , deb@@ tors and just from holiday makers , but he was chosen as a guide . &quot;
sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep a lot of herbs that one wants to keep in a good mood .
&quot; so , who was chosen to take the inheritance of L@@ ahm , a little extra motivation can only be used well . &quot;
Kim@@ e confirmed : &quot; this is what you want as a player : take responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old took over the field as a mini @-@ L@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the right rear , this is now his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did her rest . &quot;
&quot; and at all , Kim@@ e worked in this start @-@ up as the one who can also take the helm in his hand . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ rehear@@ sed tro@@ op . &quot;
he had a look at the whole while many others were busy with himself .
&quot; Vi@@ dal to over@@ play his missing fitness ( barely fli@@ pped ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches with it , on de@@ vil@@ s come out to the services of the Asia @-@ trip ( also only partly because ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le with it , in their first appearance in the Bavarian tri@@ cot not to fall neg@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked quite well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ e , Ru@@ dy in front of the defense , both acted confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli storm is often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the build @-@ up . &quot;
his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result wasn &apos;t as we were hoping for .
but he also showed a decent performance during the debut .
&quot; game storage , tempo change : &quot; &quot; for this style , I was also fet@@ ched . &quot;
&quot; as usual this Bavarian @-@ World is still for the newcom@@ ers , one saw in the connection to the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy did not give one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but definitely six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ e said goodbye after some cr@@ un@@ chy statements in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I &apos;ve already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you just have to win every game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new anymore . &quot;
Al@@ aba is motivated by Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Damen
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our O@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller has reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B ladies all the best .
&quot; the Bayern @-@ legi@@ on@@ aire is almost Klu@@ b @-@ colleague of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ in Schn@@ ader@@ beck , and fl@@ et@@ ches with our ladies . &quot;
the twe@@ et of the Austrian soccer player of the year and champi@@ ons League winners should be a special motivation .
the famous Bavarian Dus@@ el might need our ladies also well .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy pra@@ ises kno@@ d@@ ress@@ ings
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is shown after more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wis@@ sing ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprise ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ sing attacks the wishes of the economy , which Lem@@ ke has all blocked . &quot;
&quot; the biggest down@@ turn looks like in the infrastructure policy : the gap in the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list . &quot;
&quot; this year , the ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 . &quot;
&quot; the country also plays a role in the country &apos;s plans , which is in the urgent need of the federal transport plan . &quot;
&quot; the aim is to take the course into operation in December 2020 , says minist@@ erial spokes@@ woman Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees in it a sign@@ post to support regional , but internationally competing companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( Chamber of Commerce ) Trier seeks , as suggested by Wis@@ sing , in the wine a Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate label to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of the German wine exports declining for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ sing has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber pra@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; the Handwerk@@ sk@@ ammer Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; a premium of 1000 Euro is intended for the passed championship examination and 2500 euros , if al@@ um@@ ni become self @-@ employed within ten years after the master training . &quot;
but the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; with the planned road construction , facts can be created quickly , at the same time lacking the country the necessary staff , says Jan Glock@@ auer , chief executive officer of the Chamber of Commerce in Trier . &quot;
&quot; up to now , only 29 dig@@ its have been occupied by 56 new engineers who want to adjust bis@@ ons in state @-@ of @-@ the @-@ art mobility . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be allocated to external offices .
&quot; for this purpose , CD@@ U faction vi@@ ze Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf points out calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country is investing more than 20 million euros less than proposed in the preservation of regional roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frank nat@@ us also expects a country &apos;s concept as to how it wants to solve the shortage of skilled workers in the region . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the previous broad@@ band construction in the country was sober@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies had rated net supply in an I@@ HK survey only with a rating of 3.@@ 4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ating Internet connections and break@@ downs .
ex @-@ Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke is currently out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become the president of a private university in Karlsruhe , where after four months she cleared the field again for discre@@ pan@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; Audi should change 85@@ ,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter @-@ reaction &quot;
&quot; one day before Audi &apos;s announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW president said the company believes that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options as driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or limit diesel vehicles . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Daimler announced that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions . &quot;
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European autom@@ akers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to comply with regulations for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers to install systems for neutr@@ al@@ ising the exhaust gases em@@ itted by diesel vehicles , too , also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of har@@ assing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; companies are trying to avoid the failures of Volkswagen that were able to regulate the use of so @-@ called shut @-@ off devices , which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but driving back in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were accused , others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former head of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the Audi engine development in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is Itali@@ ans and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be put in court in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system in order to b@@ ypass the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi in the study could weigh heavily on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; so that the Is@@ ar visitors participate , a raft through Munich on Saturday morning , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if you go to the Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a common raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the building committee wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a big inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a rub@@ b@@ ish mountain .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a campaign campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
&quot; with the motto &quot; True love , &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to shar@@ pen the flow of wild animals . &quot;
&quot; last summer , the raft passed over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ asen and the laughter against the suffering
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed cartoon characters , the no@@ bles of his characters are his trademark . &quot;
&quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ inian is still working and working on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : &quot; &quot; laughter , &quot; &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immig@@ rant in Buenos Aires .
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he was among other things as a dra@@ fts@@ man for greetings cards through - what frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; he once said . &quot;
&quot; after stops in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his carto@@ ons in Paris Match , and then in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
even in China Mor@@ di@@ llo found many fans .
&quot; again and again , the artist was inspired by cities . &quot;
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures are in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his specifications , he still sits on the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day . &quot;
&quot; on cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his funny figures continue to find a lot of spread worldwide . &quot;
&quot; for six years , he has worked on a cartoon and a TV series with his figures . &quot;
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as a counter @-@ player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures in the 3D film , which should come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what to say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; for this reason , he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced verb@@ ally . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought , and because of the disease @-@ borne insects , what scientists and farmers try to find solutions , causing great head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert at the CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M agricultural research institute in Provence , said : &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in the past years , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small g@@ ade , a micro @-@ bacter@@ ium that transm@@ its d@@ warf @-@ ci@@ ch@@ ads , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
&quot; la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only tourists , it is also very popular for perf@@ umes and cosmetics . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; instead of having very long plant o@@ ars with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include a better distribution of water and the slow@@ ing down of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of the plants with a protective mix of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought . &quot;
the little town of Gei@@ sa in Thurin@@ gia is celebrating its 1200 anniversary this year .
the highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .
&quot; Krä@@ mer , guil@@ ds , traders , vag@@ rant or a country refugee camp should be experienced in the city centre on these days . &quot;
the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to check their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a by organised crime , corrupt officials and inc@@ ess@@ ant drug wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings suff@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists who are suspected of standing on the pay@@ roll of the government or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no break of violence , and while the corp@@ ses are accum@@ ulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 years since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to has been in office in December 2012 . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her editor and her inspiration from Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; Val@@ dez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two re@@ porters in the 1930s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wear t @-@ shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ anian hat . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their night@@ mares , in@@ som@@ nia , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a special prosec@@ utor was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists , it has only launched two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of kill@@ ings associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to justice . &quot;
&quot; at Ri@@ odo@@ ce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , even though they are in@@ consol@@ able and even though the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ erous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we mi@@ str@@ ust everyone . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot at him , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot; &quot;
the Sag@@ itt@@ arius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two grown @-@ up children .
rum@@ ors tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest in the United States last year and the delivery to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a has become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ story m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
remember for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable har@@ bours and drug trading routes in the United States .
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez was aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings contributed to the murder .
&quot; first of all , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Dam@@ o Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival cart@@ el frac@@ tions in the war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this release may have anger@@ ed the children , presum@@ ed gang@@ sters purchased every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was to force Val@@ dez , after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , to leave the country for its own security . &quot;
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .
&quot; in 2003 he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este , when he joined five colleagues to set up Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to operate journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the intoxic@@ ant problem , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
&quot; re@@ porters loved to be able to publish hard works without fear of cens@@ orship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat . &quot;
eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce she was awarded the prestigious &quot; Maria @-@ Mo@@ ors @-@ Cab@@ ot Prize &quot; for her coverage in Latin America .
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez gained the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journ@@ alists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a is a way of life , &quot; &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you must take over the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dum@@ my .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ dol@@ ce team missed Val@@ dez , the fun @-@ bird , who could curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who was generous with hu@@ gs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there at the same table . &quot;
now they ask : was his love for routine his ruin ?
his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they best deal with their work and stay alive .
&quot; they don &apos;t like to deal with their wives , their children , their clean shops , their secret run@@ ways and run@@ ways to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high level of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells wrong , stay away . &quot;
&quot; the anger is , the editor of the Fe@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be fool@@ ed ... and then the thing happens with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just as not in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero and other states where a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the space where the staff from Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , there were suddenly no mobile phones . days before it became known that Spy@@ ware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
&quot; outside , two polic@@ emen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree . &quot;
they were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers whom the governor himself was not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it is months since the re@@ porters have gone into the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control . &quot;
&quot; for the issue of this week , Ri@@ dol@@ ce li@@ cked on three main stories . &quot;
there was the murder of brother of the former famous bo@@ xer Ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
&quot; they also had an expos@@ é to the state spending , concentrating on the hom@@ etown of the governor . &quot;
&quot; and there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block away from the office of the prosec@@ utor , carried out a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or what happened , so caution was offered when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian who belonged to the governing Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) , which ruled nearly the whole century all the political levels . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption in high @-@ cali@@ bre cases . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; just a few months earlier , the readers of Val@@ dez had viewed the column of Val@@ dez as the best informed source of kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; we used to know what happened before , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; because of his slender body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office became a storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the kill@@ ings of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few notes and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist for the office of the prosec@@ utor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
a burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its .
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by written down in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on pav@@ ements and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on this day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is away in Washington and tries to gain international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the case of Val@@ dez . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the Gover@@ nor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and to leave them because they said the truth . &quot;
&quot; since then , she has asked her to be re@@ structured by the government because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objectiv@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and a uniform society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media fan group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico die you die , because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and head@@ phone were beside her separate head .
&quot; some branches have chosen to close , such as El Nor@@ te &apos;s newspaper in the northern border state of Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of the correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lav Bre@@ ach in March . &quot;
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the murder of her director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z publicly addressed the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the title page with the heading &quot; What do you want from us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and look for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted as it seems to the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who stay behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , admitted that the drug trade was frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and that &apos;s why I became re@@ porter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to sum up . &quot;
a number of sho@@ ot@@ ings with belt riv@@ ets and security forces near the resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left behind 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated on as promised by a series of cart@@ el em@@ b@@ assi@@ es in the region .
&quot; from the cur@@ b edge , they published the news on the website of Fe@@ odo@@ ce via mobile phone . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens how@@ led nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were ready .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they did not show it . &quot;
&quot; under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you remember , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; &quot; when the same day J@@ avier was murdered , the train@@ ee asked me to send her to the street . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to avoid their enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a sc@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; now , researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible r@@ ash@@ ort of a Canadian min@@ ers have been preserved so well that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of the Dinosau@@ rs . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it was so good that they could even find that his fla@@ ky skin was of red@@ dish brown - and they said that she had had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described him as &quot; the spar@@ ed ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r , who was ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
&quot; the fossil is a newly discovered species of no@@ dose @-@ din@@ osau@@ rs , who lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period from 110 million and 112 million years ago . &quot;
&quot; its incredibly well @-@ preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as &quot; &quot; really remarkable &quot; , &quot; &quot;
according to National Ge@@ ographic reports the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant e@@ ater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .
&quot; it was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he founded on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something that seemed to be out of the surrounding rock at the place , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 Po@@ und ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) heavy pe@@ an@@ kl@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you blin@@ d@@ folded a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , &quot; said the chief author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ r exempl@@ ars - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; researchers have found out that this plant @-@ e@@ ater , although it is covered with arm@@ or and resembles a moving tank , was probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique , which is known as a counter@@ point , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed to interfere with his surroundings and ev@@ ade his enemies , experts say , suggest@@ ing that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now to be seen in the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mar@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli named Mark@@ ab@@ ch@@ elli named after the museum engineer Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team who spent more than 7@@ ,000 hours to discover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising as the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta by far exceeds the animals living today . &quot;
&quot; it suggests that din@@ osau@@ rs were hun@@ ted by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , that evolution encouraged the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival . &quot;
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter sh@@ ading - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or belt @-@ animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which sign@@ alizes that this no@@ dose @-@ din@@ osau@@ r was exposed to a real battle for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ r predat@@ ors of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period have been &quot; , &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life , including his con@@ served bow@@ el content to find out what it eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and drove out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time Alber@@ ta was as warm as southern fl@@ ori@@ da today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dose @-@ din@@ osau@@ r is really remarkable , because it is completely covered with preserved fla@@ ky skin , but remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , &quot; &quot; said Brown . &quot;
the result is that the animal looks almost as same today as in the early C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use a lot of imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just shoot a bit with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is at sleep . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Time was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , stood on two legs , passed through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the ar@@ mor@@ ed din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monster . &quot;
&quot; scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he founded on March 21 , 2011 at the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the painted din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long lace mounted from his shoulders .
&quot; the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed plant @-@ e@@ ater was sw@@ am through Western Canada , until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea . &quot;
but the din@@ osau@@ r &apos;s underwater equipment kept its arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of this particular specimen are preserved so well that the hoods cover still b@@ ump@@ y tank panels along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as winning the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I approach it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y pl@@ ating plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right front foot rests on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales at his sole .
in thunder@@ storm : mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age on A@@ 8 : many wounded
heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , miles of stone and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the motorway Stuttgart @-@ Munich ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon with a mass car@@ am@@ bol@@ age . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , at 17@@ .00 o &apos;clock between the connection points Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) during a thunder@@ storm almost 30 vehicles , among them probably also trucks , crashed into one another . &quot;
&quot; at first , no information is available about the exact number of injured persons . &quot;
&quot; a police spokes@@ man said it was moderate to moderate violations , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large number of emergency vehicles were charged at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of Munich , an approximately ten kilometres long set@@ back formed . &quot;
&quot; as an A@@ Z re@@ porter reported , there occurred also on the counter @-@ road to massive disabilities - through numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; the fire bri@@ g@@ ade listed the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , which now have to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties . &quot;
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident happened on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing else is sitting in the train and sleeping .
or you are deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ alo .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes up a uns@@ us@@ p@@ ecting or tear@@ ing off the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the free ticket control .
it is simply confirmed by mobile phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test operation is running on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will likely be available at many other long @-@ distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , &quot; &quot; said a railway spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; is the name of the railway . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use it , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do .
&quot; you also have to have it over the app of the railway , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; because the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works like this : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
a button for the electronic de@@ valuation appears with the test customers .
train companions get a message on their mobile devices that Pas@@ sen@@ ger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
the train companion at the ticket control at No@@ .@@ Y knows that there is a passenger with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to keep quiet . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train , which in turn should use the passenger . &quot;
&quot; if you want to travel relaxed without ticket inspection by our train atten@@ dant , please check in the DB Navigator itself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their journey more personal in the train , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Managing Director of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; who often trains the train knows that , in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket inspections are among the greatest off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for many times , however , one of the travelling companions does not have all the documents required for the de@@ valuation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to point out is missing .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in checking his own tickets and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns . &quot;
only a small number of test customers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s just the ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional numbers on the same track are not yet un@@ locked .
how an activ@@ ist came to answer the question : &quot; wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken to her core . &quot;
&quot; only one day after having arrived in New York City , the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment they rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on their phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from High School .
&quot; the police have just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it is still on the road , &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot;
&quot; confused as nobody else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly re@@ port@@ edly prayed on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ ets the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white police officer in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted an image of Brow@@ ns lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she left her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ et on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of the police band and people crying out , and by a man claiming to be his father , who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on &apos;s police has just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
&quot; she watched a live feed , in which a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of demonstr@@ ators with a bark@@ ing dog . &quot;
&quot; in another video , she said , another polic@@ eman secured his gun and shou@@ ted , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l remembered her testimony . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical .
at that moment I felt shi@@ vering .
I was angry and wept . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
&quot; after landing at 23 o &apos;clock , she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter out of her father &apos;s house and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning . &quot;
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on is the topic of a new documentary , &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? , &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11th century . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two spoke a conversation that they had &quot; &quot; black experience and the black condition &quot; &quot; countless times before this morning . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she remembered what she said . &quot;
&quot; we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right . &quot;
&quot; I could not take her with me , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot;
what is happening today is a climax of what happened in the past .
it must know and see it and be drawn up in it .
&quot; it must be well developed not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any blat@@ ant racism , she is not different from the next black women child . &quot;
I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it .
&quot; the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .
they prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new kind of activ@@ ism for Fer@@ rel@@ l began to take shape .
&quot; after August 9 , my activ@@ ism has changed completely , &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and concentrated on food @-@ justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organizing .
everything has come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later , Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an , one of the co @-@ directors of the film during an evening demonstration . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r wanted to &quot; &quot; document &quot; &quot; what happened . &quot;
&quot; a question came to her mind : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an already collabor@@ ated with the co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt insi@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years following Brow@@ ns &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; said Davis . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for so I am going to be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ is &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader , but a community coming together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets &quot; show surprising personal aspects of Ferr@@ ara &apos;s life as she falls in love with her wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said and laugh@@ ed when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I understand that there must be a certain vulner@@ ability in this work and for the de@@ human@@ isation of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the Movement , who after the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin have shaped the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media in 2012 , identify themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said , &quot; and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women have to bear the brun@@ t of everything . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; &quot; the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women . &quot;
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ m@@ ative type of action , &quot; when Fer@@ rel@@ l was selected as the heart of the film due to its identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook up this energy , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is no accident , although she was at the front , because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black , gay woman is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long since disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on par@@ ole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
she describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area she calls her home : &quot; a chaos . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the road three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on . &quot;
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love each other and support each other .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;
from &quot; dream &quot; to meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania : TV readers discuss bit gallery
&quot; the bit gallery moves the people , even though it is not built for a long time . &quot;
but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct collap@@ sed since the first presentation in 2009 the population in advoc@@ ates and opponents .
the topic scarcely lets the issue get cold .
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the Bit Gallery say , &quot; This would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be really great &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ sten ) , comes from the other side : &quot; no man needs &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , from which the rest of the shops profit , the opponents fear that the pedestrian prec@@ inct is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands , in which 13 direct market@@ ers offer their products . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the construction work , it will be concluded . &quot;
the gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to Bed@@ a @-@ Platz with possibility to sit outside .
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping in the farmers market almost every week for many years now .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the land@@ lady again and again very gladly . &quot;
also the but@@ cher &apos;s shop we discovered for ourselves .
we would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , there is also this . &quot;
especially the Klein@@ mark@@ thalle in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery refers to the amount of rent .
this should probably not be very low in the new project . &quot;
Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; what are the shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ?
&quot; whether clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I find that superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
there is plenty of this in our city .
you can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .
&quot; but since there is not even a good weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains to us . &quot;
&quot; after all , the commodity offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is well @-@ priced at the top . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shop stores are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies , because the rentals there are often not acceptable for a retailer . &quot;
&quot; a pity , special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear again . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall doesn &apos;t fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit to Bit@@ burg .
above all : where to go the farmers market hall during construction ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming up sometime .
&quot; or does the spec@@ ter Bit @-@ Galerie already create , to exp@@ el all business from Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; George Mar@@ quet : &quot; &quot; this will simply not work . &quot;
&quot; and a shopping center , which stands empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion , it would have been better to have a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - there is no more room for sen@@ sel@@ ess construction projects in Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; when the farmer &apos;s market is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ing DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York , many faces are to be seen - white , black and brown , almost un@@ notic@@ able - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the 30 portraits were created by He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , the artist He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , who were sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing sent the excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison , where the former intelligence analy@@ st served a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after making publicly stu@@ ffed diplomatic reports about the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website . &quot;
&quot; the new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance ( a suitable simil@@ arity ) . &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years of correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combines its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ woman and a dis@@ sident , whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; through the algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Mann@@ ing , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the forms of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also to identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , among them six transgres@@ sions against the es@@ pi@@ onage law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; through the prison her image was supp@@ ressed , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ iny , black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie , in which Mann@@ ing is obviously sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg just came from the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts such as cigarette dum@@ mies and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an e @-@ mail from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press preview of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait . &quot;
&quot; the artist and her imprisoned m@@ use became too hetero@@ geneous , which in the course of two years exchanged several letters . &quot;
&quot; they even created a comic &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future in which the President of the Over@@ seas would be converting judgment and that it would be able to personally see the exhibition . &quot;
&quot; that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , Mann@@ ing would demand release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy meeting . &quot;
&quot; there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong , since Donald Tru@@ mp is leading a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender forces to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to fl@@ aming up the rigid spl@@ its he should actually fix . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Mann@@ ing called on its over@@ sized signature ( the &quot; i &quot; in its sur@@ name is equipped with a heart ) an end of the &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , &quot; the basis of gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall , their mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence - a thous@@ and@@ ler of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific le@@ x@@ icon of the artist ) , as amazing , at least in biological terms , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome doesn &apos;t care who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , too . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above mentioned comic @-@ nov@@ elle . &quot;
she shows Mann@@ ing how she appears with a hands @-@ free phone in his hand from the disciplinary field of the United States as King Kong .
&quot; when they let down your speech , they have won &quot; , &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so , never stop the mouth . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , who greeted me from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing hasn &apos;t seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which are like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ing St@@ atur ) , where their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with a pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee at Oxford University for killing
&quot; a nationwide human race is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an Oxford University staff , who are looking for susp@@ ects after a man had been stab@@ bed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , for W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) arrest warran@@ ts were issued for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , such as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
&quot; a common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago , states that the corp@@ se was discovered on July 27 . &quot;
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead at the scene of the events , and det@@ ectiv@@ es examine the stit@@ ches as murder while the police actively seek the two susp@@ ects , officials said . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ them has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ ism , the vice president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail explanation that La@@ them@@ is now being app@@ reh@@ ended and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case , which is examined by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University co@@ operates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
&quot; a spokes@@ man for the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail that &quot; &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investig@@ ative authorities in every possible way . &quot;
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to be shocked .
&quot; chief Communication Officer of the Chicago Police Department , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urged the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said local , regional and national authorities will help to find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand @-@ Plaza building , who had just received a pu@@ zz@@ ling tip that said something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , it is unclear whether the incident took place on July 27 . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that La@@ them and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team of Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we will conclude the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mut@@ ko &quot;
Russian deputy minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; mut@@ ko declared on Thursday . &quot;
the PM commented on the second part of WA@@ DA &apos;s road@@ map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re@@ integration of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website .
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything has been announced , everything is being implemented . &quot;
&quot; and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; one of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , is that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WA@@ DA by Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren to alleged state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in relation to the matter , Mut@@ ko said , &quot; We carry out the investigation as our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , the leader of the independent Russian Anti @-@ D@@ oping Commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the beginning of the day , Sm@@ ir@@ nov made problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but then added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one has to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; said Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was excluded from the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the dop@@ ing sc@@ andal .
&quot; however , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after visiting the headquarters of the Moscow organization in July , WA@@ DA general director Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA &quot; moves in the right direction &quot; in order to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs anymore for the time being

&quot; it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could no longer be assumed by any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the communication . &quot;
&quot; as of now , only eggs are expected to be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been proven to have been tested negative on fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ous anti @-@ L@@ amps . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency with its customers .
start @-@ ups that will help your company not to become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck at your e @-@ commerce startup , but the surveys didn &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; responses were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ Commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she called for help from outside .
a new breed of Human Resources Start @-@ ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measurement of employee engagement , it enables companies to address surveys , provide specialist groups and demographic groups , provide employees anonym@@ ity and complaint hot@@ lines , and in some cases W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers allow to b@@ ypass the C @-@ Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; they now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for their health , but where is the Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees &apos; commitment . &quot;
ret@@ t said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap Sur@@ veys and Sur@@ veys from certain teams , it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - allowing you to drill down why . &quot;
&quot; companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain , so that you won &apos;t be the next U@@ ber who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment where those who have spoken are punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , according to the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , who helps companies prevent and detect bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year in the middle of the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ alles in Mis@@ sk@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has almost 600 clients , including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
u@@ ber has recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send tailored &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat charts of your problem areas . &quot;
it also provides an anonymous SMS hot@@ line that allows employees to report bad behaviour .
&quot; and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion app@@ alled the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; when a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has used Con@@ ver@@ cent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policy and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company employs Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were sitting in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed faster , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair practice . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 @-@ degree view into experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who heads the Risk Management Group from Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; and we protect our shareholders against employment legal disputes . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; companies began to take Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Ander@@ sen collap@@ sed due to ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent offer your software as a service and debit the companies with recurring fees for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance to find the consent of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; cent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , raising capital to $ 47 million . &quot;
gl@@ it@@ tering secured $ 10 million in November of B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners and brought his total funding to $ 60 million .
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising , given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets like Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only stak@@ es . &quot;
employees want the feeling that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you will give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company , feel that their voices belong , and that the work they do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this business successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , who used both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten when their portfolio companies run well . companies are running well when employees are committed and engaged .
&quot; if third party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement in accordance with the experts of workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company take no measures .
&quot; in fact , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change is not fast enough , or not at all , this can discipline dis@@ appointments and de@@ motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you are asking for 4,000 suggestions , you need to be ready to have 4,000 conversations , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who has seen companies that rely too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; for if you don &apos;t follow , employees ask themselves , &quot; &quot; Have you really heard me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , she was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; in Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always receives new insights into the employees , and it hopes that in the long run this leads to better binding of employees in a sector known for high revenues . &quot;
&quot; if you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose company . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for Bru@@ ins
it starts at 11 o &apos;clock when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ ers talk on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on campus .
some have pulled out their tri@@ cot tops and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break . &quot;
players who are enrolled in the Summer Cour@@ ses will return to their final examinations after the three @-@ hour exercise before returning to the Water man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 am .
&quot; that &apos;s for the guys the next three days a real treadmill , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday for Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminates two @-@ day exercises to ease the load of the players , and it has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three training sessions of U@@ C@@ LA should start at 7 : 15 pm in order to meet the already fully packed schedules of the players . &quot;
&quot; the compromise between the two days is more than a day , at which the fry moved the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as performed six seasons in West@@ wood practical exercises . &quot;
you should last 18 exercises over the course of August . 20 before starting the formal game preparations for its pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September .
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supports the change of rules of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous load three or four days on it , and it is very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they spread themselves , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice as soon as the camp is finished , which in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel of up@@ scale class that is already dischar@@ ged with foot@@ balls , which is a protective net behind a gate , no easy task . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far from thinking that people are renting a room there and then set out to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the video tape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking lot 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ checking in the fight against fake news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reports to third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to fight so @-@ called F@@ ake News . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to detect possible false noti@@ fications and send them to fact checks , which may be displayed results of the invoice verification from the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters being flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to be punished according to social media networks , if they fail to remove hat@@ eful mail@@ ings as before the elections in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook announced in a separate statement in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new facts review will be launched . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the recognition which stories of fact @-@ beating third parties are challenged , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook News in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook continues to be testing its feature to the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and works on other changes to its news feed to reduce incorrect messages . &quot;
creating a novel novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 @-@ s and 1980 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from its cozy seat in the Ir@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;
&quot; I find it so nice to look at the hand@@ writing of someone who has been dead for 300 years , &quot; &quot; he says melanch@@ oly . &quot;
what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England &quot; covers the period from the Middle Ages to the era of Edward and documents the families living in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac steering ie@@ wicz , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des based on an archive : in 2014 , he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotion@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; I have only responded to a letter of thumb on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 @-@ s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb @-@ print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself was there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived for almost four months in a castle ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; &quot; ) this all seems too beautiful to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted Hy@@ ban@@ ished Heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landsc@@ ap@@ ers , gar@@ den@@ ers and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key &quot; and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate story of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last Er@@ bin , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the staff only began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; &quot; hundreds of years ago , in which aristo@@ crats said &quot; &quot; Oh , cast it on the attic . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent what had it : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let everything go ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to del@@ ve into English history on a broader basis , including &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an uph@@ eav@@ al that appeared in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book titled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says . &quot;
the peasant uprising began in this area and I thought that an insurrection was a good beginning .
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it pat@@ ers , who hid the Dar@@ rel@@ l family for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l from the 18th century depicted his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favorite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite ga@@ si@@ es , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l @-@ men saved their debt crises by mar@@ rying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his use in the castle , Rho@@ des is looking for other unique write experiences &quot;
&quot; he spent a two week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ män@@ mä@@ ki , the site of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has been rec@@ laimed by nature again since then . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go back , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Oh , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign started : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle covered in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the cover of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , the City of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) . &quot;
&quot; even until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team headed by Nelson Ar@@ tz will keep the logo and slogan secret . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , there will be a feast on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th as the highlight of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; too beautiful for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; , &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel . &quot;
&quot; we think that ( of course ! ) do not really &quot; , &quot; they write on their yesterday released website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; basically , we are firmly convinced that as a bad Honnef citizens , we know very well about the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city . &quot;
&quot; the action is more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate an all @-@ inclusive promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; after all , they are competing with other local authorities . &quot;
a middle five @-@ digit amount will cost the City of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; each year at the beginning of August , Ankara is advising the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) on pen@@ sion@@ ings and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first sight a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the attempted coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the building of the general staff , as before , but in the office of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also participated in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the over@@ population . &quot;
the government re@@ treats the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; chief of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 fired up the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the ex@@ iled pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the wire @-@ drawing of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 persons , who have been directly involved in the attempted coup attempt , is being negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan had called the overthrow test as a &quot; God gift , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to completely clean@@ se the armed forces . &quot;
but Erdo@@ gan really has the army under control ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article entitled &quot; un@@ ease in military headquarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the general staff there are concerns about an increasing &quot; &quot; Islam@@ ization &quot; &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the ban on female soldiers , wrote the paper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the gener@@ osity of the army and the security forces is continuing . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan ordered a further 7@@ 3@@ 95 prosec@@ utor , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed as if Erdo@@ gan had t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly known as the actual masters of the country .
three times they listened to their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; after his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pushed back the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union . &quot;
&quot; former officers say , Erdo@@ gan is specifically pushing forward an Islam@@ ization of the armed forces . &quot;
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; a particularly unknown officer who was seeking asylum after the attempted coup attempt in exile abroad , the Turkish army will be &quot; &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and Sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts &quot; &quot; in a few years . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such a development could not make NATO cold . &quot;
&quot; anyway , there is doubt in the alliance after cleansing doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army . &quot;
&quot; the management structures and operational capabilities are &quot; &quot; weakened &quot; , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , cited by the media . &quot;
&quot; he fores@@ ees to lower the legal immigrants to 50.000 per year , more stringent regulations for obtaining vis@@ as for temporary work permits and restrictions for family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft law shall be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .
&quot; &quot; &quot; this law will reduce poverty , save wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by changing the way citizens are issued Green Cards from other countries . &quot;
the law will prevent the chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to rehabil@@ itate route for road ascent
over the past few months over the future of the race car has been fought over and over again - now it should go quite fast .
&quot; before the end of the year , the road on which the tourist train runs , is to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race gate in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction work will start on the track this year . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and san@@ e the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this especially for tourism , &quot; explained road Secretary Klaus S@@ üh@@ l on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
it cost about 2.5 million euros for the repair of the route .
&quot; of this sum , the country ski@@ ps 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered also in the future from the country , is currently being agreed defini@@ tively , declared S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gia railway as operators are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards were negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; in this way , the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle should be ordered on a regular basis on December 2017 . &quot;
the Renn@@ stei@@ g @-@ Shuttle is a popular railway link between Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g railway stations .
&quot; in the course of a pilot operation in the course of a pilot operation , the track had been tested by a large number of people in order to order them regularly in the future . &quot;
the track is also in parts strongly b@@ ump@@ y .
&quot; the rise of sex robots is real , and we should be worried &quot;
&quot; just as you thought it will not be even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming . &quot;
&quot; yes , actually . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
&quot; recently , the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ) ( FR@@ R ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years . &quot;
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we need to start taking her ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but the companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , &quot; said Mr Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the release of his new report . &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot according to his convic@@ tions and choose everything from the eye colour of the robot to the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or colour of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that would make a step@@ ford woman progressive . &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as timi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed person@@ ages such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which con@@ veys the impression of timi@@ dity and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as good as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses True Compan@@ ion &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed to conversation or she can &quot; &quot; be in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many wor@@ rying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female features , the all@@ u@@ sions to rape , when one goes a step on Fri@@ gi@@ d ( i.e. here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah , uns@@ ett@@ les a most . &quot;
on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator but for men .
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men then have no Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and increasing refin@@ ement indicate somewhat darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men will of course not keep sex robots , and while the FR@@ R re@@ members their growing popularity , they remain pro@@ vision@@ ally on the br@@ ink of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what transp@@ ires from the outskirts , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market is given permission to do so .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots will appear in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have attacked women sexually . &quot;
&quot; the most deter@@ rent aspect of the TV series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The Report of the maid &apos; ) is not the graphic images , the intri@@ cate body and the daughter &apos;s eyes , but how realistic this vision is . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel in@@ human@@ ely that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , to the point when it comes to its &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are no real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are forged slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the Rede@@ mption of 2017 : ma@@ ids

he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of common sense
&quot; it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tru@@ mp era that the political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US voters , have also split families in small format . &quot;
around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving Day there were newspapers in the USA with advice on how to deal with the horror of tru@@ mp loving relatives .
we all said to us all to burst our filter bubbles .
&quot; less noticed is the power of Tru@@ mps , bringing families together . &quot;
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that the unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship , with whom she fought for decades for politics , suddenly and completely stran@@ gely on the same side . &quot;
&quot; to the dining table it is certainly a good thing , but it falls into a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the vag@@ ue possibility that one day his bi@@ bs will no longer meet us . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even more frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp Repub@@ lic@@ ans norm@@ alize the right wing , which suddenly appears as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself occupied by an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s ur@@ funny version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp in fact occur as very mild criminal off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Republi@@ can can only be mentally sound to qualify as an im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ou@@ sels of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don &apos;t need caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are enormous , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are grow@@ ling and the animals are twi@@ sting to face full fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the lim@@ p music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of tall buildings become old , the sky@@ lines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city will not live up to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I &apos;m still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the theme pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage is not counting - but a big roundabout in northern London . &quot;
&quot; however , the Central Park car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , since two two @-@ year @-@ olds , a 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ er years can be on it and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , I was forced into a department store this week to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could pass my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to pay the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what should be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no one is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ olog@@ ising gru@@ mp@@ ing , while I tired the experience of submitting my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us transferred from prison to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was taken to hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his wrist , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal of the prosec@@ ut@@ ors against a first death ris@@ er .
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day in 2013 by firing them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed he kept his girlfriend for a ni@@ gh@@ tly intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention , this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say they are too indul@@ gent . &quot;
&quot; the National Prosecutor &apos;s Office said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
Pist@@ ori@@ us risk that his sentence is increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful .
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
when farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the Blum@@ berger schools , the four @-@ quarters cl@@ ones were dischar@@ ged from F@@ hats and E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen into vacation and secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students will go to secondary school in the future , four at the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , the director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte greeted the parents and representatives of the public in the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 students of the four classes headed by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der chose a young Adler who grows up in the hen &apos;s farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Lower Sch@@ ar performed a musical with the title &quot; The Eagle in the hen &apos;s Farm . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it spread from his chi@@ ckens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken neck , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope of making a chicken from him was sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain . &quot;
&quot; after that , the classes showed three and four in studying Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young Go@@ ck@@ eln , who wore cylinders to make the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stands for integration , said Schul@@ director An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belong to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
his determination is to be free .
she wished every quarter @-@ wat@@ erer that he felt accepted in his new school .
&quot; this was followed by a letter of gratitude to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who repeatedly ski@@ pped the classes and the parents &quot; representatives . &quot;
&quot; now the cu@@ cum@@ ber time is over , class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher announced . &quot;
&quot; after two years of teaching , they were very reluct@@ ant to teach their students , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ door wat@@ chers . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students made a song of summer@@ time and holiday time . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , great joy broke out among the children . &quot;
eight first @-@ grade students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television . &quot;
&quot; on the morning of August 1 , a group of illegal refugees arrested in Si@@ th@@ onia was arrested by the police , including the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released , while an investigation is underway . &quot;
the Foreign Ministry reported B@@ TV that the Bulg@@ arians were later released .
&quot; the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free camp and place any who is found to stay in a place that is not meant for this purpose , substantial fin@@ es . &quot;
controls are continued throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what people need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers participate in the promotion ?
overview of the most important questions and answers .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they should improve the emission characteristics of cars of the emission classes Euro 5 and some Euro 6 .
Euro @-@ 4 diesel or worse are excluded .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin of ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments :
is the new action obligatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates negotiated are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the mandatory updates previously apply to the vehicles , the che@@ ating software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
their retro@@ fitting has ordered the Kraft@@ fahrt @-@ Bundes@@ amt ( KBA ) .
how and when are customers informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers have announced a swift implementation over the next few months , but not yet an exact date . &quot;
Daimler announced to write to each person affected .
&quot; if any inspection is due , this will be done within the framework . &quot;
how long will the retro@@ fitting take place ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
it depends on the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the autom@@ akers do not act voluntarily on the subject of the environment . &quot;
how long should the update last ?
the re@@ armament could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming could be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do who do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE tells to wait .
&quot; presumably foreign manufacturers would prefer , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;

ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to be political .
one of the pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inners doesn &apos;t want to come - from protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) is the first ra@@ pper to get one of the cov@@ eted awards of the prestigious Kennedy Center .
&quot; this year singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the honored . &quot;
the awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and together with his wife Mel@@ ania will attend the award ceremony . &quot;
the winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV shows therefore already announced to refrain from participating in the gala .
&quot; he said : &quot; &quot; this Pres@@ i@@ dency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to depri@@ ve them of the means - and that burden me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use Tru@@ mp to clarify her views .
&quot; the Kennedy @-@ Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the U.S. capital . &quot;
&quot; the former lau@@ re@@ ates include Mer@@ yl Stre@@ ep , Are@@ tha Fran@@ klin , Robert De Nir@@ o , George Lucas , Tom H@@ anks and St@@ ing . &quot;
we make the city worth living
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re this year . &quot;
the place is already written - but suitable candidates are ra@@ r .
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker has been a City Engineer . &quot;
and the work still makes him a lot of fun as he medi@@ ates in the press talk .
&quot; he reports from varied , but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is surprising that up to now no application fulfil@@ s the requirements profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; in this way , in compliance with the regular periods of notice , there is still enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach is responsible for the administrative community as the Lower Civil Code , the applicant must present relevant conclusions . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if it would no longer be able to fill it , citizens would have to go to Off@@ enburg for advice . &quot;
&quot; but citizens &apos; proximity is important to the city and it itself , says W@@ acker , who reports from a good working climate and good atmosphere between authority and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back at the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is confident about the Bau@@ amt and its employees . &quot;
&quot; but also in the future , varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot about are initiated . &quot;
&quot; the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed , also the stadium renovation is still a topic . &quot;
&quot; the latter alone will be sm@@ ashed with approximately 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; in terms of design , there is plenty of room for a Stadt@@ bau@@ meister . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gardening , many things can be re@@ acted flexibly . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye on what to do , &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going City Buil@@ der stresses . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the Stadt@@ bau@@ meister has a high level of responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; in the end everything runs here over my table . &quot;
he can count on many years of employee support and coordination : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been doing Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) for the past ten years .
&quot; also that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and wanted to stay with the job . &quot;
continuity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city .
anyone who wants to be buried by Roland W@@ acker should have a completed course of studies as a diploma engineer or bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in architecture according to the city of Has@@ lach and have good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning law .
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt are subjected to civil and civil engineering , construction management planning , under@@ mining matters , administration of urban property , urban yard with building yard and urban gar@@ dener , as well as the Lower Building Law Authority , including historic monument protection . &quot;
bicycle thrown on lines : frozen in the south
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of Le@@ ob@@ ener Straße ( B@@ 116 ) on the lines . &quot;
they were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since the night .
&quot; near the crime scene , witnesses of a sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses . &quot;
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ bu@@ ben@@ reich , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch to the AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator or the perpetr@@ ators had brought himself into great danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system , as well as the delay and the costs for rail transport , there could also be sponsors of the railway customers to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; overall , there was a &quot; substantial &quot; sum to go out , the speaker said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south @-@ way route could be led without any obstruc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; nearly ten people had dropped off Friday morning , two of which were concerned by the long @-@ distance traffic . &quot;
&quot; freight trains failed , but they were late . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch , some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts were also damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help ease IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a night@@ mare .
&quot; but a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able condition , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rho@@ ea , weight loss and extreme ti@@ redness . &quot;
&quot; while suffer@@ ers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to allevi@@ ate their symptoms , researchers found at the Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut . &quot;
&quot; the leading researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , stated that immune cells in the gut are pat@@ rolling in order to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in food do not penetrate the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to trigger inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , an inflammatory bow@@ el disease may result . &quot;
experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance @-@ promoting immune cell in mice occurs which carry a certain bacter@@ ium in its intest@@ ines .
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
&quot; Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance . &quot;
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promote intoler@@ ant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus when the same system works with people . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance , when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was accommodated separately , did not . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference was to do with the intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the ga@@ stro @-@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and there were found six species of bacteria present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
&quot; mice were taken up in a sterile environment , so that an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were created by L. reu@@ ter@@ i and immune cells . &quot;
&quot; to understand how bacteria develop on the immune system , the researchers led L. reu@@ ter@@ i to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to un@@ ripe immune cells isolated from mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed to the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was puri@@ fied from the liquid , it turned out to be a by @-@ product of the tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabol@@ ism known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; if the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the feed of mice , the number of cells increased by around 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were hal@@ ved , the number of cells decreased by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerance @-@ promoting cells such as mice and that most of us protect L. Cross @-@ ter@@ i in our gastro@@ intestinal tract .
&quot; it is not known whether Tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han by@@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop cells in humans as well as mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han were found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine . &quot;
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has committed a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; at Manchester United has signed a &quot; &quot; genius &quot; &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic , Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho , after mid@@ fiel@@ der had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea started with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday began and impressed in the owner &apos;s role as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira stepped forward at will . &quot;
&quot; M@@ atic , however , was excluded from the pre @-@ delivery Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes what M@@ our@@ in@@ ho granted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he needs time , but his experience , intelligence , genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u went to the Avi@@ va stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho made his start @-@ XI for the beginning of the season . &quot;
&quot; this week , the Independent revealed that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho claimed three more new obligations , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already given a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of his four primary new commitments . &quot;
&quot; three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have done great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner in the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in the U.S. state of Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and a minute .
on the radar screens the form of a Dream@@ liner was to be .
the whole was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had already made such advertisement before .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new grav@@ ure for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; but as the wind revol@@ ves : when Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD boss , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Ministers always looked at Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no fire from the party headquarters , but no counter @-@ wind from the Bund , was the most important wish of the election fighters . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has fundamentally changed . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals . &quot;
what Schulz has been getting from there since the beginning of the year would not have been described in the approach with a head@@ wind .
there were grav@@ ings .
and one by one .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CD@@ U sees a general signal against co@@ ali@@ tions of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green cannot be ruled reliably , &quot; said CD@@ U General Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) has pl@@ ung@@ ed into a serious crisis by Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) .
&quot; five months before the parliamentary elections , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green @-@ Austrian managing director Michael Kell@@ ner has called upon the back@@ sliding down @-@ Saxon Gre@@ ke T@@ ires to return their mandate .
the transition to the CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the elec@@ torate &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ westen must immediately return its mandate , &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and election leader of the Green Party to the German editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; an SPD election fighter si@@ ghs , when the new job message reached the party headquarters on Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the transfer of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ westen to the CD@@ U without its own government majority . &quot;
it is the preliminary climax of a whole series of big and small crises in SPD national associations .
and no one knows what will happen next .
the Mis@@ er began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades reli@@ eved at the time . &quot;
&quot; after the legislative elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
&quot; that was , and indeed , everything became much worse . &quot;
&quot; the defeat in Kiel caused the SPD to tum@@ ble , the Düsseldorf @-@ P@@ lei@@ te tigh@@ tened the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks after , the comrades lab@@ ori@@ ously ra@@ ced again . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just given new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit of Hamburg came . &quot;
and with him came the next depression .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD country leader , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city was burning . &quot;
&quot; and because in crisis communication , he made pretty much wrong with what you can do wrong . &quot;
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; due to the VW exhaust gas and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony Prime Minister has already been critic@@ ised for a long time . &quot;
added values were added .
&quot; in spite of this , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l has always tried to make accents in the Con@@ federation during the past few weeks . &quot;
&quot; the ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin , too , did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
they let him grant him as they promised to stabil@@ ise the party by Wei@@ l .
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l finds no fault in the party @-@ internal constra@@ int of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz at all .
&quot; at the same time , comrades endeav@@ our to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed towards the Gre@@ ens , and above all on the back@@ sliding parliam@@ ent@@ arian ts@@ v@@ ests . &quot;
&quot; it is unbe@@ ar@@ able and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ westen puts her own career star@@ ters on the interests of all others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , Head of Party Left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the German editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ westen has not been elected as direct candidate because of her personality , but by the state list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens , so the Lower Saxony member continues . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , lam@@ ents an &quot; un@@ democratic maneu@@ ver . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vote four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Wei@@ l a prime minister , &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD as a top candidate in the parliamentary elections , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career presents the election result of a future CD@@ U MP , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he demanded to clear the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Nieder@@ sachsen .
funding for center III
those who want to renov@@ ate their house in the years can soon get support from the country .
&quot; in addition , mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representative St@@ eg city development informed on Wednesday in sensi@@ tivities . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what happened so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there have been remedi@@ ation areas in sens@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; back then , in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the Land of Baden @-@ Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still at 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the previous renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is important to promote inner development , not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , I received the information from the government president Karlsruhe that there will be a remedi@@ ation area III . &quot;
&quot; the sum of the funding amounts to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 euro come from the country , the rest of the congregation &apos;s sensi@@ tivities . &quot;
how does a remedi@@ ation area come into being ?
&quot; one will continue to investigate , as Sch@@ ind@@ ler , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
but it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is any interest in san@@ itation .
&quot; if necessary , the area borders could also be moved again . &quot;
&quot; the bridge represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; cellar presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; &quot; Sozi@@ ale Stadt , &quot; &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of inner cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be carried out in an object @-@ related manner , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the remedi@@ ation area would then finally be defined as a statute .
&quot; since 1 January 2017 , the funding period for the funding will exp@@ ire until 30 April 20@@ 26 . &quot;
&quot; until September this year , however , the survey would be carried out only once , within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill a questionnaire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , the statute of the statute shall be carried out in order to begin with the renov@@ ations in the coming year . &quot;
&quot; afterwards , Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann stated that each commune must carry out the aforementioned pre @-@ investigations . &quot;
&quot; it is a question of assessing and determining the urban gri@@ ev@@ ances , when it is rehabil@@ itated and to what extent . &quot;
for the respective property there is also a san@@ itation mem@@ orandum in the land register .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will come again after feeling and make a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
&quot; for this reason , questionn@@ aires will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; building and property sheet , &quot; in which , among other things , it is about the construc@@ tional state and the renovation prospects . &quot;
&quot; in the gray questionnaire , the &quot; &quot; household and housing &quot; , &quot; details about size , layout and habit@@ ants of a residential space can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; Operation arc &quot; is only to be filled out when operating rooms in the building .
&quot; however , to be noted , Got@@ zel pointed out that a filled out questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not eligible . &quot;
Sch@@ ind@@ ler also stressed that the distribution of the feed means working according to the &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; - who first comes first grinding first .
you can &apos;t reserve funds for later . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Location II &quot; &quot; were shown to make a rehabilitation &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; &quot; to those present . &quot;
British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to come with a hand movement in house and car
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through its company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he joined Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , a Consult@@ ant An@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and lasts only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am also wants to change the locks of houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the cost of the White House costs the tax@@ pa@@ yers
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that raises US production last month , costs tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military personnel who have been left to TI@@ ME Magazine , up to $ 24@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the President is on board , was the cent@@ re@@ piece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; built in Connec@@ ti@@ cut , next to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a fire@@ fighter car from Wis@@ con@@ sin and a for@@ klift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House Military Office demanded the presence of helicop@@ ters in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of Marine Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event to his superi@@ ors , the deputy naval commander for aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South La@@ wn on July 17 at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , and stayed until the lawn between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 was vac@@ ated this evening . &quot;
&quot; the note also adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second crew for the return flight would be required due to the limitation of service hours . &quot;
&quot; the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane . &quot;
the recordings provided by TI@@ ME were not clear whether a second flight crew was required in the end .
the H@@ atch Act provides federal states to use state property for political purposes .
records indicate that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could violate the destination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the command@@ ant wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds like you are locked , &quot; said the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but also official events have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was going on in the Senate , and he propag@@ ated the efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of aircraft , known as Navy One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for the journey .
but to use their use only for a photo op is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation as the president of the presidential plane took place against the background of his first campaign r@@ all@@ ye in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential aer@@ op@@ lane by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; &quot; - the products from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the deputy secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 cre@@ ws frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to set the US president in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; as Tru@@ mp in early July at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany , H@@ MX @-@ 1 carried out 58 practice land@@ ings in the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted during the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant . &quot;
&quot; helicopter @-@ units flew an additional 11 hours this day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ presi@@ ding support missions &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers over@@ took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved to issue the helicopter on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget@@ ary records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24.@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
the unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers on the basis of estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the yearly funds . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the reimbur@@ sement rates for Do@@ D do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former press spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things that are made in America this week , &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know that Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
&quot; and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans worked ti@@ rel@@ essly . &quot;
of course it is reasonable to highlight that .
&quot; it was not clear whether Tru@@ mp was inter@@ acting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire bri@@ g@@ ade . &quot;
in the White House he spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and sh@@ ook with the media about his own fleet of company products .
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the President , &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;
TC BW Ne@@ uss in front of tricky task
fron@@ trun@@ ner of the Second Tennis League joins the third @-@ third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss will take place tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; despite five games still flaw@@ less balance , the fron@@ trun@@ ner of the Second Tennis League has got the sense of reality . &quot;
team Princip@@ al Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; just at the post@@ erior position , I find the team very good . &quot;
&quot; for the class and stability of the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high North are mainly concerned . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even refer to missions in the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay with a view to Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen and Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this will be difficult for us . &quot;
you also need a good portion of luck . &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is convenient .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; if the Fren@@ ch@@ man is currently playing the Chall@@ enger tournament in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) is playing at the tournament in the Czech Liber@@ ec . &quot;
the previously un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo was yesterday with the White @-@ rus@@ sen An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ sky still at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball .
&quot; he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ schul@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories on Sunday against the Club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also back into the team . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was the number one of the Junior World R@@ ank@@ ings in January 2016 , does not fill someone from the coach station around Mari@@ us Z@@ ay to the Ka@@ der . &quot;
how America can harm the O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp was not really happy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law for the tigh@@ tening of sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his hurry to en@@ act the Law , the Congress adopted a few &quot; constitutional provisions , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was fo@@ aming against the U.S. offensive . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft looks to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors in the domestic O@@ MV are worried that together with other European firms , the construction of the Russian Eastern Partnership North Stream 2 has been co @-@ financed . &quot;
the dr@@ one is huge .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an assessment of the consequences , thus the official statement of the oil group . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to bring the sanctions to life even by Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; has seen which the group could resist , and which could really hurt it . &quot;
&quot; Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar , the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is placed in the center of the charts from Net@@ fli@@ x . &quot;
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , which Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar Kil@@ ler reveals , the series of Net@@ fli@@ x is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the relay three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , DE@@ A has directed its attention to the richest organization of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 enterprise &quot; only with more government bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the Kart@@ ell , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Francisco Denis ) command the Mexican link , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ az@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian law enforcement authorities to support the war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will start on September 1st .
role backward : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organizes the K@@ ita lunch table again .
with fixed contacts for the children and an assignment to the team .
&quot; in the city &apos;s day @-@ care centers , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city &apos;s day@@ care centres ( Kit@@ as ) . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ er@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooked is still out of house : a cat@@ erer takes over this task and supplies fresh scre@@ ened .
&quot; the city operates 46 kinder@@ gar@@ tens in the Kre@@ feld area , in 44 the children get a warm meal at lun@@ ch@@ time . &quot;
&quot; in the last Kit@@ ee year , 28@@ 00 children sat at the tables , and the need is growing steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children , who are cared for 45 days of the week , eat in the K@@ ita at noon , &quot; explains Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the offer also applies in the 35 @-@ hour care when children stay until 14 o &apos;clock .
&quot; 46 partial @-@ time staff will have kitchen service from September 1st . they heat the supplied food , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , por@@ tioning the meal individually , giving away food , clean , rin@@ se and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a cl@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as sevent@@ een units - decides about the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen hel@@ pers now belong to the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ er@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they are much more involved and it is easier for the hospital management to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
it &apos;s also about healthy eating and cooking .
children should help prepare food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is reasonable .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a well known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for children .
the cleansing of the K@@ ita @-@ rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - is to be done by special clean@@ ers in the future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also the charm that it turned out to be the most economical in the cost comparison of the city as the most economical way out of the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured . &quot;
&quot; but these hours do not fall into weight at around 750 persons in the educational field , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
three women en@@ code for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women .
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women fully participate and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and the presidential elections take place on 5 April .
&quot; the Taliban have published threats against a choice process , which coinci@@ de with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role . &quot;
&quot; this year , the elections for the first time will hand over power peac@@ efully from a democr@@ atically elected government to the next . &quot;
Hay@@ on said that a strong role for women will strengthen the democratic success of Afghanistan .
&quot; the Afghan independent Ele@@ ction Commission reports that 1.2 million women of total registered 3,@@ 6 million voters are registered . &quot;

men try to exter@@ min@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to depri@@ ve a 13 year old girl .
&quot; according to the police information , the men talked about the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who stayed with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße at 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to make phone calls with the phone of the girl . &quot;
the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request but continued with her friends .
&quot; as a result , one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to seize the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , but what ab@@ used . &quot;
without loo@@ t the duo fled .
the two young men could later be arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie Factory in Glasgow
a trade union wants to make a union with Mc@@ Vi@@ tie managers over the long @-@ term commitment to production in Glasgow &apos;s plant .
G@@ MB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investments at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
more than 500 employees work in the factory that produces other products Hob@@ no@@ bs and R@@ ich Tea bis@@ cuits .
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives were &quot; first experienced &quot; if their activities were to change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie &apos;s claim to &quot; &quot; raise concerns that financing for modernis@@ ation of production lines is not being pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB @-@ Senior @-@ organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy , said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we can win no clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross , our members are deeply concerned about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers focus heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of the Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow is urgently needed a thri@@ ving production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman at Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the manager at T@@ oll@@ cross has received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it as we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and G@@ MB representatives at T@@ oll@@ cross where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we continually review our business - and that applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; in recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our ra@@ bies area , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognize the heritage of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production site full of attention . if our operational processes change at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
has PS@@ G Barcelona warned three years ago before N@@ ey@@ mar ?
the page of La League may regret your interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main will not leave N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s persecution after leaving a £ 18@@ 9 million offering to release its release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record raid ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has started the transfer window in summer , as the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double its previous mark , with Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned to Manchester United for 89 million pounds in the previous season . &quot;
&quot; after completion , N@@ ey@@ mar will become the most expensive player in the world and the highest paid professional ath@@ lete in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500,000 GBP a week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is fur@@ ious about the way N@@ ey@@ mar forced his way outside , although there is a source near the Catal@@ ans Board that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival in San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G president against this prospect ?
&quot; as Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players in PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish association expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to ab@@ ort under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their price offers for N@@ ey@@ mar . &quot;
sco@@ oter fli@@ cked and damaged
&quot; during the night of Friday on Saturday , an unknown perpetr@@ ator deliberately turned one sco@@ oter in the Königs@@ felder Strasse in front of the property number 30 and thus caused damages of over 200 euros at the fair@@ ing of the vehicle . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for advice . &quot;
the police are looking for witnesses to an accident at the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese .
&quot; because he was driving a car in his lane , the driver had to ev@@ ade a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ ted the control plan . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday evening , the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um reached the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au in the direction of Le@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car came to him in his lane , so that he had to do@@ dge to the right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an driver tou@@ red the control plan . &quot;
on the passenger car was kind of damage .
&quot; the driver of the opposite passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had over@@ taken a truck and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident report , it may well be good that the Mer@@ ced@@ es@@ ier did not notice the accident at all . &quot;
the police now asks witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the pol@@ lu@@ ter vehicle to contact the Com@@ miss@@ ariat in Stol@@ zen@@ au at Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
&quot; interview : &quot; &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen report on the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves the burden of Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
this means author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann .
the final report about the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen continues to provide discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man for the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; announced after publication to the German press agency , he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and today &apos;s Cardinal Gerhard R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
it would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church when Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret over their own om@@ issions or their then false app@@ rais@@ al of the processes .
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critic@@ ised that &quot; double standards &quot; were measured in reporting on violence in the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in regards to the en@@ cro@@ achment in Regensburg , no one doub@@ ted that it was &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the &quot; degree of media manipulation , &quot; says the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ stag@@ ia , historian and member of the National Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already a part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , &quot; said Scar@@ stag@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; in the interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk , Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn and Ta@@ xis also said : &quot; we like to go to the church and this is a found fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth &quot; &quot; blows a very normal educational tool &quot; &quot; had been , &quot; &quot; to cope with che@@ ek@@ y children , as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases , Pope &apos;s brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often appeared . &quot;
&quot; the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , who wrote the commemor@@ ative tape &quot; My brother of the Pope , &quot; written with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I have to take care of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; &quot; because all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; &quot; he evalu@@ ates the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is the 440 @-@ page report presented by the B@@ ist@@ um Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen were sexually ab@@ used between 1945 and early 1990s , &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; victims of attacks , 67 Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is called Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; in summary , it is possible to conclude that by R. in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence were applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with high emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more violent . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to numerous other defend@@ ants , however , many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in numerous cases , even positive memories are connected with him . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal in the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence exer@@ ted at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contradictory picture of &quot; &quot; Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to the one hand , many students raise his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eri@@ ker and perfec@@ tion@@ ist , who became more tangible when a Dom@@ sp@@ atz brought no top performance musi@@ cally . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself more about why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is all about it . &quot;
he has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acqu@@ itted of any suspicion of complic@@ ity or co @-@ knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .
the ex@@ propri@@ ation of violence at the pre @-@ school was also ex@@ propri@@ ating outside its sphere of action .
&quot; at best , one can pre@@ tend to experience it too late or have taken initial indications seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um on which he worked was felt as literally &quot; &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; &quot; - literally &quot; &quot; redemption &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; better world &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so also the vast majority of his students Georg R@@ atz@@ inger describes a very excellent testimony , described him as &quot; warm , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teachers , who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and candy and &quot; always surrounded by clusters of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority compla@@ ins about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to out@@ breaks . &quot;
&quot; the fact that he did not only kne@@ ad with chairs and threw the key on the ground , but also pulled off ear bad@@ ges and pulled too che@@ ek@@ y boys on the hair or ears , he himself had already given years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for that . &quot;
&quot; however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the late 1960s and 1970s , both in parents and teachers . &quot;
do you know such breeding methods as well ?
&quot; of course , I think each one of us who was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is about in this report , namely the terrible sexual abuse and the ex@@ odus of violence at the pres@@ ch@@ ool , these are ad@@ mitt@@ edly bag@@ at@@ elles . &quot;
one wonders whether or not it is rather familiar with his fame and role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI that many media just r@@ ushed to him .
&quot; in the Bavarian pop@@ e , many who have never understood him are still working di@@ lig@@ ently . &quot;
but the truth is : the report reli@@ eves George R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in connection with the report , the media reported a lot about the subject of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : quite clearly no .
no one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claims to have entrusted to the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk about it with my father or my mother , &quot; &quot; said one person to the other , &quot; &quot; It was very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
the real problem in educ@@ ating sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims remain silent .
&quot; if they didn &apos;t even trust their parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators professionally . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen students rate R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student put it like this : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg R@@ atz@@ inger ) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that ... bu@@ ben more intru@@ sive or clearer , or more likely to have opened than compared to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , confidence teachers etc . &quot;
that one talks to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of the report on the very clear result : &quot; &quot; in the run @-@ up to affected pupils and / or their environment , the report could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to talk about any involvement . &quot;
&quot; in this way , he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to the court . &quot;
&quot; therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these conflic@@ ting crimes , as unfortunately occurred in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , a lot of &quot; &quot; violence &quot; &quot; was to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
the former Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; looking away . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : that &apos;s the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere , right in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; but this , in turn , is an abuse of the report . &quot;
&quot; namely , it is separated clean@@ ly : between the pre @-@ school and the grammar school of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and violence and , let &apos;s say , other accus@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report covers incidents from the period since 1945 , so also for four decades , in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole aw@@ ful examination pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were properly slan@@ ted and mal@@ igned and suffered from them , were all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions must have reigned . &quot;
&quot; but with those he had nothing to do with the Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because he didn &apos;t get the boys to face when they were already at the gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on that , as most witnesses emphas@@ ise , the theme of &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; abo@@ u . &quot;
one was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even par@@ adi@@ si@@ ac@@ al states .
what was different on the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , in which the report concludes that &quot; many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories with him . &quot;
&quot; at the most , the accus@@ ation remains to be seen . &quot;
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods when it was reported by the states at the pres@@ ch@@ ool . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible ( such a witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
is Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently closed ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral gymn@@ asi@@ um who even re@@ produces the report . &quot;
&quot; in this he points out this , &quot; that in the pres@@ ch@@ ool , the test penalty will continue to be practi@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was , as test pen@@ alties were banned in Bavaria too long ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , it took place in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult to estimate for him , where the affected people might be exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ zed , and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
&quot; but you can &apos;t say , he has always looked away . &quot;
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the punishment of schools was officially abol@@ ished in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria of Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis claimed , it was unfair to apply the current pedago@@ gical standards at that time . &quot;
how do you see this ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians are talking about the &quot; trap of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; that is , the danger of assessing the past according to today &apos;s moral standards . &quot;
&quot; then , the princess was right . &quot;
&quot; but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse , which has been abom@@ in@@ able at all times and also not for what has been bre@@ ached in the pres@@ ch@@ ool of ad@@ versity and violence against innocent children &apos;s souls , that goes far beyond that at that time . &quot;
&quot; this is all aw@@ ful , and I am glad that it will finally work out . &quot;
&quot; but at the same time , I must protect Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , that is , ear@@ ring and pulling the ears and ears were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; when physical punishment was then banned , he also kept strictly adher@@ ing to it . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his Regensburg &apos;s time did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger reproduced in the talks with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of test sentence also come to the language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it &apos;s about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , told from his perspective , that the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen only played a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I did not at all admit that he had a strict regi@@ ment there . &quot;
&quot; but also this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without demanding discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with cookies and bon@@ bons alone , you don &apos;t even make a great singer from rebel@@ li@@ ous boys and stand in front of every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self @-@ overcoming . &quot;
what kind of people did you experience as Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond that , I really got to know George R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful , humor@@ ous , deep @-@ minded , deep @-@ minded and heart@@ felt people , from which one can &apos;t imagine that he could only do something to a fly . &quot;
&quot; I receive regular contact with how many former Dom@@ sp@@ atzen still today , 23 years after his em@@ eri@@ ding , regularly get in contact with him , visit him , he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he once was strictly to them , are thus clearly in the minority . &quot;
most of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are thank@@ ful to him today that he has enriched their lives and told them the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , pat@@ ernal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a lov@@ able dis@@ respect@@ ful person , to whom they still look and worship them today . &quot;
&quot; and please , again , quite clearly : everything you propose to him are educational methods which were at that time on the order of the day . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent that stands behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; for the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves him . &quot;
&quot; now the insurrection would command a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who acquired great mer@@ its and , without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany , nobody would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , finally in peace . &quot;
