<seg id="2">An Irren institution where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt chapel that is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Small gardeners are cultivating the former ground of peasants.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It annoys when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows everybody who had to upset himself because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases, an offer of the Geoportals Bavarians of the state government, are anything but current - but very revealing."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially when comparing them with current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how towns and municipalities in the spread-area of the Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork carpet, which one recognizes as such."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the large map of the map became more detailed maps, so-called primeval sheets for towns and municipalities."</seg>
<seg id="13">These were created according to the Bavarian surveying business between 1810 and 1864 and spring from the first survey of Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="14">Your principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">The French military leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country, and commissioned a topographical survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes."</seg>
<seg id="17">"after all, when the French troops came out with the peace of Lunéville on February 9, 1801, the present neighbours who created the idea of a surface-covering Bavaria card were."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV Joseph drove the project forward, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and therewith the Bavarian Surveying Administration."</seg>
<seg id="19">The original composition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like any other on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison early / Today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"an example of this is the Untersendling, which is still relatively isolated in the 1856 map."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was founded 21 years after the creation of the map, thus in 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, Untersendling is in the middle of the city."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along today's Plinganserstraße, which was first named after George Sebastian Plinganser, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today the west park is, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: at the zooming out appears a small-scale map with dozens of lines and numbers: hand-written numbered plots from the so-called" "primal-up" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small plots today show no farmers, but small gardeners of the plant" land in the sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, the site of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact a meadow in the 19th century - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the field of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" at Gasteig "or from the height" Auf der Lüfte "- but also in large letters" Irren Anstalt. ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße, people once locked up people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59, the Munich district-Irrenanstalt" "On the Auer Lüfte" "was created there."</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden headed the institution - that psychiatrist, who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was advanced for his time and, for example, ended the Ankhing of the so-called Irish."</seg>
<seg id="36">"he also prohibited the staff from applying force against occupants," says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Haidhausen museum, who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution. "</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients first place, later, 500 seats were added."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreisirrenanstalt in Haar1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost, one of Germany's largest psychiatrists, has been there since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people meet at Salesianism in Munich on the site of former Auer Anstalt.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth hostel with educational establishments.</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" "Casa Don Bosco" "was built in architectonic style to the country of origin of the asylum-institution, which had been destroyed during World War II by bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was listed in 1856 as" "Main Square", "the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">The Allies bombed many holes in the city centre in December 1944.</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt chapel dating back to the Middle Ages stood at the Marienhof where these days were the preliminary work and on 5 April 2017 the ground breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn line."</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Group published travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">National unification for the promotion of coloured people has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri because of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks of the state.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which will enter into force by August 28, 2017, calls on afro-American travelers, visitors and Missourians to pay special attention during travel through the state, as a number of questionable, race-based occurrences can occur throughout the state and be noted here," "says the Group's opinion."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law by Missouri, which makes it more difficult for people to claim discrimination, as well as the prosecution authorities of the state that disproportionately target minorities, prompted the group to release the warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," said the President of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents like racist attacks against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">"Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year, after he had no more fuel during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being charged with a crime."</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Missouri Public Prosecutor, which is shown that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more common than whites."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," "said Chapel."</seg>
<seg id="62">People have to be prepared to bring the deposit money or let the relatives know they travel through the state.</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri reported 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the FBI's hate crime reporting program, which classify the state with regard to the number of such violations in the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it more difficult to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states had passed immigration laws to arrest people for immigration violations, which, according to the ACLU, will contribute to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries, but lately interest groups have put the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">Electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fishermen's Weidefence project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU members of Parliament Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac have given themselves a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">"at the right-wing cemetery of the Schwendemann family, representatives of the CDU local associations met together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies."</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann first granted insight into his farm, in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and also many young animals, and accommodated in five apartments holiday palaces."</seg>
<seg id="72">"for him, the" Black Forest milk "is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows, so Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regionales can be found on the table of the Feriengäste.</seg>
<seg id="74">"since it is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the fence project as" elementary. ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profitably manage on such steep surfaces.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the green area care for a lot of work, much needs to be worked on with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography," "stressed Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if he did not lead a biogas plant."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune recognized the importance of the fence project and is happy about the leadership. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the reforestation of the land could be pulled out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue their operations," "said the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often in the criticism because of the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 parcels were fenced off by eleven participants."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the open-air area covers an area of 40 hectares, which can not be brushed up to at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"from the total cost of €71 500, half was funded by leaders, a quarter contributed to the community of fishermen."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus, the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometers of pasture fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," explained Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and landladies it is not possible."</seg>
<seg id="90">"Peter Weiß asserted that" "best food is produced here."</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Line (LPR) Baden-Wuerttemberg provides the state-of-the-art production of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The aim is to disclose the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The precondition is the availability of a material drawn by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the area to be enclosed must not be smuggable (slope of over 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fishermen's Weidezvaunching Project in 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 plots, who want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the disclosure surface is 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking up the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans value these as well as any other - hence the carefully orchestrated overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated argument with Jim Acosta from CNN about the President's proposals on the drastic restriction of legal migration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not attack the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imitators would have smitten him if he had done it.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he resorted to their significance, and in particular the importance that it was attributed to, when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903, 17 years after the completion of the monument, was added to its basis."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta complained," I don't want to mention a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">"the poem, which you refer to, which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is factual right, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary resonance on the stirring words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state invites not only some old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" "your weary, your poor, / your oppressed masses who yearn to breathe freely, / the poor waste of your rich coasts."</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "turning waste" on our screens was better to see.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller did not commit himself in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trumps USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate: it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus - and her friends, who sat down to place their words after their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture was to show the connections between French and American republicanism by portraying the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical depiction.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus has changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a completely different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between the poem and the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"the great writer Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty would not invite anyone but rather an early neoconservative that brings the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty goes ahead. "</seg>
<seg id="119">She is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not illuminate the way to the United States.</seg>
<seg id="121">Limbaugh is rather unusual here.</seg>
<seg id="122">The meaning of the statue is quite and even a question of the point of view of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative act of Lazarus consisted in seeing them as they were seen by the exhausted, afflicted but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the deck of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the true sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and that is, of course, not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever wish to acknowledge."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not illuminate the path, but the hatred that is their only source of power ignites."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Cup 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team</seg>
<seg id="130">"the performance director of the United Kingdom's athletics, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the world championship race will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was chosen for London 2017 to start on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "in Scotland something special" "and the athletics of the UK have to learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it and we try to understand it, and we will carry it forward until we find it out," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, among them Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart, who will compete against Sir William Farah on the 5000 m circuit, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her Captain's speech was incredible," "said Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, that Eilidh, naturally brought in, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth Silver Medal Winner, competing in their fifth world championships with the 400-m hurdles, says that it is" unbelievable "that 16 Schotten are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"until now, Scotland's best total number of athletes competing in the World Cup was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle distance runner Muir leads on this path and last year placed five British and two European records.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman, which you should watch for a great season, which included victory at the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembers her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in Team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says that they are" enormously proud "of the fact that many of their compatriots are not only part of the team, but in some cases also with the medals and at the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being a team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammates have voted for me and chose me makes it something special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as well-established athletes, athletes who want to rise to platforms."</seg>
<seg id="155">What is my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think it went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion.</seg>
<seg id="159">"I get a second chance to go out there and compete, and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there."</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking critics on Facebook: do not worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the infusions of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of bad news.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it did not last long until the newspapers struck him because of everything, from domestic politics to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he knocked at the critique, for sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and mute, we are led like sheep for slaughter. "</seg>
<seg id="166">"this brings me to Maryland, Governor Larry Hogan, who must work to be more like Washington."</seg>
<seg id="167">"Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people, who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="168">"and the American Civil Liberties Union, therefore, accused him of the beginning of this week."</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online commentary was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, "and?."</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," "said many people."</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heathead.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">"he was also very skilful to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters, playing his hair-loose head after chemotherapy on his side."</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blockage of persons coming to the governor's side is a public forum, which is considered official and paid by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogans spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it's too easy to use the picture of trolls or spammers or hateful people who vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are just real people who speak with their chosen leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a pastor, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan's Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani von Bowie, Md., was not hateful, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I commented on politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other recent news," she wrote in the comment section of the news posting "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I don't appreciate this idea, if a number of people take a position on the same subject, they are ignored by some rather than a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the Governor's staff referred to as" "concentrated spam attack" "would probably call" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, when you have done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical items, or to arrest and silence the demonstrators."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that exactly happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official to criticise Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is accused of Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question was last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the President of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County dumped First Amendment, according to U.S. District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banned a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit to the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">This should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of an affordable port had a similar effect on the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers was multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous letters written on his leadership."</seg>
<seg id="200">And even then Washington had anonymous trolls.</seg>
<seg id="201">"people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Porzio, "wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions, who criticised the Treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain, overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the Online Paper of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he did not put them to silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses belong to the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means to accept that.</seg>

<seg id="369">Lack of press control means that the international pressure on the Indonesian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Papuas.</seg>
<seg id="370">"in March, six pacific states - Tonga, Nauru, Palau, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the" various and widespread violations "in Papua, including the Paniai shooting."</seg>

<seg id="379">"they don't need money, they just want justice," he says. "</seg>

<seg id="423">"in addition to the ever-triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets, Tesla CEO Elon Musk first revealed a different, less glamorous figure for the first time: the cancellation of the new mass market model 3."</seg>

<seg id="425">"now Musk admits: from the total of 518,000 preorders 63,000 had already been withdrawn."</seg>

<seg id="440">"a day after having been sued by 15 states, Scott Pruitt, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, regained its earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era in order to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants."</seg>

<seg id="442">He did not mention the lawsuit which had been raised against his previous position in a Federal Court of Appeal.</seg>
<seg id="443">"it is a deadline for states that expired on October 1, in order to comply with the standards of Ozone in 2015."</seg>
<seg id="444">Pruitt announced in June that he would delay the compliance with a year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid interfering with local decisions or hindering economic growth.</seg>
<seg id="445">"Pruitt, who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump Attorney of Oklahoma, was a long time a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations."</seg>
<seg id="446">"since its arrival in Washington, Pruitt has repeatedly passed on to block or delay regulation, to which the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels resist."</seg>
<seg id="447">The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the most recent legal setback for the Pruining regulatory rollback agenda.</seg>
<seg id="448">"last month, a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator has exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule by the Obama administration, the oil and gas company to monitor and reduce methane leakage."</seg>
<seg id="449">"in a statement released on Wednesday evening, Pruitt suggested that its reversal at ozone standards is quite simply the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfillment of the new standards."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade on Sunday, 16 July at 4.30 p.m."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius plant is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">Visitors to the Sixth Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the town have made friends and promoters of Tumlingens to their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini stresses: "it is a unique rural gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267, the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in documents by the Württembergischer deed of origin: count Hermann von Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogtei" at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver. "</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the wording of the document, there was also a beautiful courtyard on the Tumour mountain except the former parish church, to which the church or the patron saint belonged, and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt of 1858, it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf, which are still visible today in the village of Tumlingen, the" mountain "of the third, the scenic settlement nucleus of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps from the period around the year 1600 are underlined by these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The privilege of patronement arose from early medieval self-church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church and occupied with a priest remained the owner of this church, and could also bequeath the church."</seg>
<seg id="478">Associated with this was the right to use a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">Three altars existed in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The size of the two dismembered at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell rang out for the first time in 1692, but later had to be handed over during the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were hammered and the belfry were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in 1796, French troops camped near the church."</seg>
<seg id="485">They broke out the pulpit and church chairs and used them as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumour Hilarius-cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was demolished.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was stopped.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Night 1834 a storm split the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was demolished."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower still present today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>
<seg id="493">"today, Horst Kallberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are cultivating the Hilarius plant as successors by Dieter Dockhorn."</seg>

<seg id="764">Yvonne Staiger is strictly speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement.</seg>
<seg id="765">It sees behind it a hidden subsidy to any wealthy or even foreign investors.</seg>
<seg id="766">"this is not the case, as with the acquisition of the surface one does not give any surplus, but gives a real, in the case of doubt marketable countervalue, that is the counter-speech."</seg>

<seg id="862">"with the first season of the season Andre Hoffmann was satisfied, with the result too, would not have been the two opponents of the 2: 2 against Braunschweig."</seg>
<seg id="863">"these were two opponents too much, and we have to watch out better in Aue," "says the defenders of Fortuna Düsseldorf."</seg>
<seg id="864">"in the Ore Mountains, the three-dimensional chain should also be further optimized."</seg>
<seg id="865">"and a gate after a blast, the Fortuners don't want to catch up anymore."</seg>
<seg id="866">"for the future, there will be no more than Michael (Rensing) on the line."</seg>
<seg id="867">"Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the experience in preparation with the three-tier, than with the four-chain-chain."</seg>
<seg id="868">"yet I don't know how we will act in Aue," his trainer Friedhelm Funkel says, but Hoffmann is sure of his cause, "because we have just been in the trinity on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gißelmann players who can build well," said Hoffmann. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we can even better harmonise and do not make so many aberrations in the construction."</seg>
<seg id="870">"of course, Hoffmann is also driving to Aue to win the game."</seg>
<seg id="871">"but if you can talk about a mismatch from a mischievous start, don't know."</seg>
<seg id="872">"the performance could be okay," "said Hoffmann."</seg>
<seg id="873">"but if we are on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup, we will certainly be able to speak of a good season opener."</seg>
<seg id="874">His trainer wanted to know nothing about this.</seg>
<seg id="875">"I only judge the start of the season only after six to eight seasons," said Friedhelm Funkel, who would not like to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be cancelled due to a storm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season with a home game," "said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a bit fresher since they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna versus a budding favorites in the bones."</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know as 100 per cent where they are currently standing," "says the inner defenders of Fortuna."</seg>
<seg id="878">"admittedly, the guests from the Rhineland serve as an easy favorite on Sunday in the encounter at last (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep them away, just because we are entitled to come under the first six is bullshness," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>
<seg id="880">"there is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga, which you have to beat from the start," explains Fortunas Head coach. "</seg>
<seg id="881">"to make such a statement would be arrogant, arrogant."</seg>

<seg id="884">"the recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden, undergoing a new method for assessing their age, show that more than 80 percent of the tested people are older than 18 years. but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results."</seg>
<seg id="885">The Swedish authorities for Forensic Medicine (Rättsmedicinalverket) started conducting the tests last year.</seg>
<seg id="886">"during the asylum procedure, they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age, after the Swedish Migration Service (Migrationsverket) was criticized for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor."</seg>
<seg id="887">"up to now, Migrationsverket has sent 6,880 trials to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017."</seg>
<seg id="888">Eighty percent (2002) were evaluated as 18 or older while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was "possibly 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="889">"in 432 cases, the conclusion that the person" may "may be under 18 years of age."</seg>
<seg id="890">Tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results are steady in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we don't see a big difference in statistics of the past few months, the numbers are fairly constant," "he said to the magazine" "The Local." ""</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged more than 18 years does not imply that the asylum seeker has lied over his age.</seg>
<seg id="894">"in May, the agency published the results of 581 tests and said there were 442 cases stating that the requested person was 18 years or older."</seg>
<seg id="895">"when the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet submitted the 581 published results, she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year."</seg>
<seg id="896">"the method of medical age assessment, in which X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRI scans are made of knee joints, which are then analyzed by dentists and radiologists, was also criticised in some areas."</seg>
<seg id="897">"a sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute, whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later than usually through puberty."</seg>
<seg id="898">I had reason to think about it and I don't think the type of measurement should be used.</seg>
<seg id="899">To judge the biological age in this way is very unsafe.</seg>
<seg id="900">"if we can't say it safe, we should not do as if we could," "he said to the newspaper Metro."</seg>
<seg id="901">"Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency, however, defended the accuracy of the tests:" "generally, you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low."</seg>
<seg id="902">"the biggest risk is when the person is under 18, in this case, this is about 10 percent."</seg>

<seg id="996">"despite his comments, the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) found evidence of state-funded doping in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="997">"I thought it was a very open answer today, a very honest presentation," said IAAF President Coe to reporters. "</seg>
<seg id="998">The whole council and the whole congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some quite hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned.</seg>
<seg id="999">"CoE said he was also" "pleased" "that Russia accepts the criteria for its reintroduction."</seg>
<seg id="1000">"I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of Task Force that this is not the moment to re-use Russia," says Coe. "</seg>

<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unimpeded spending of European football clubs will not disturb Neymars world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"there will be any consequences for Paris Saint-Germain from the UEFA, as the leading organization that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules launched in 2011 by the UEFA mean that PSG has to prove, at some point, that the transfer from Neymar has been financed without major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to purchase the Brazilians from its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">"with security, PSG can make the money loose in order to sign Neymar and bring him to a galaxy of other stars, given the financing of the team by the energy rich royal family of Qatar."</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but have to counteract legitimate income sources that allow them to break the break-even point in their football-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA President in 2007.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs, which had taken enormous debts in their quest for success, effectively deceive and risked to ruin themselves when banks or proprietors withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentrating on the debts of the clubs to monitoring its losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in 2003 in Chelsea - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - become a harder issue.</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year FFP period, which runs until 2018, clubs can accept losses amounting to EUR 30 million."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"and although Platini has fallen from the Presidency in 2015, its UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to scare away from excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will definitely strengthen the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although the PSG paid the buy-out clause from Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for the invoice on the duration of his contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the proceeds can be expelled for the next five years amounting to EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 has hit the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the hardest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"the PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"UEFA is looking for clubs that might try to outwit their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies, associated with the owners of a club."</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a Catalan company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, the UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This was exactly what happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the sponsor of the PSA was inflated by Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments could come to Neymar on payments by the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar WM ambassadors will become and such a manoeuvre for UEFA regulators to be easy to figure out.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that the UEFA will be even more attentive to take into account any attempt to circumvent the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG over Neymars Transfer, announcing on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation."</seg>

<seg id="1211">The police have succeeded in a blow against the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">"on Wednesday morning, numerous objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar district, in Rottweil, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart."</seg>
<seg id="1213">15 accused were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years and already issued arrest warrants against them.</seg>
<seg id="1214">"in addition, officials accounted for large amounts of marijuana and cocaine, firearms, and several hundred thousand euros."</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two people were arrested at the time of the same raids in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">"against the two suspects Italians, there were German warrants of arrest."</seg>

<seg id="1218">In the action Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved.</seg>
<seg id="1219">"in total, more than 300 policemen were employed."</seg>
<seg id="1220">"the Mafia members are accused of organised drug criminality, violent acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor's office has been investigating the organized drug trafficking in southern Germany."</seg>
<seg id="1222">"between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo, there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily."</seg>
<seg id="1223">"therefore, the large-scale deployment was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo on Wednesday morning."</seg>

<seg id="1230">"in the case of asylum procedures and deportations, defects in the data recorded there may result in" "serious misdecisions", "warned in an analysis published by the" Süddeutsche Zeitung. ""</seg>
<seg id="1231">"according to the information, ten million people with foreign nationals are registered in the register, including around 5.7 million from non-EU countries."</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 foreign nationals in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">"because the data were not adequately cared for, the data quality has not been good in parts so far."</seg>
<seg id="1234">"in individual cases, data from 1921 were found," of people who are no longer alive, or citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register. "</seg>

<seg id="1236">"in the statistics of sufficient taxpayers, EU citizens are also included, who would not have to travel at all."</seg>
<seg id="1237">"such false declarations, however, led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient taxpayers," says the analysis. "</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">"the Bank of England is expected to be announced later that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have dampened speculation about an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain "sluggish" when it retained interest rates on family income in the middle of an intensifying pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the policy makers of the Monetary Committee (MPC) of the Bank voted with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25%, with fewer members growing in this month as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and to 1.6% in 2018 and warned that pressure on budgetary income would continue, although inflation expected to rise to almost 3% in the fall."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but it signalized that in the next few years, interest increases would be needed to curb the inflation of the Brexit and she said that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">The members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammoth economic stimulus package issued one year ago after the Brexit.</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will require time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks as of next February, although it has been said that it is now expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"the Bank said:" "in the central forecast of MPC the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak short-term, as pressure on the real income of households continues to be burdened by consumption."</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the rate of interest, it repeated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be necessary to cool inflation and a" slightly bigger "scale than the markets expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets are forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of the next year and one further in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"however, the Bank stressed that increases would be" "gradual" "and" "limited". ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It has retained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">"the pound dropped by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and fell by 0.4% to 1,11 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="1278">The decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened the rising expectations for interest increase and GDP in the second quarter increased from 0.2% in the previous three months to 0.3%.</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth is expected to be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it is likely to recover slightly after the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households that are affected by rising inflation and minor enhancements, since the tightening will be worse before it becomes better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that in the coming years monetary policy could not" "prevent the incomes from incomes", "but she added that wages are" "clear" "at the end of their three-year forecasts."</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also boosted by rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak Pound, which will compensate for a portion of lower consumer spending."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes a year after lowering interest rates to 0.25% in August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the decline of the fund."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to fully achieve the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"prior to the Bank's final decision on interest rates, the call for interest rates rose, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three political decision-makers increased to 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation has dropped from 2.9% in June to 2.6% in June, although the Bank said that this was expected and will attract them again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said the excess in proportion to its target of 2% was to be attributed to the weak Pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" in view of the recent swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the lenders are loudly looking for businesses and want to end the year in a positive way. "</seg>

<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment in September following a fight in front of the High Court against the financing of the drug in NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that prior to sexual intercourse, pre-exposure prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now supplied by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial, after the Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year that the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"the move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as an" important new intervention, "while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexposure prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations that are taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces the HIV transmission in infection risk.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep prior to intercourse means that just enough medicines in the body of a person are present to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medications can be taken every day or as early as two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"suitable participants are identified in clinics that agree to the study including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV-status is not well known by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">People living in England and registered with a GP can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sex clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program will sign £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive purchase.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to evaluate the full potential of prep by collecting, recording and implementing clinical evidence in a large scale."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the more than three decades of ongoing progress in coping with one of the biggest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, if it is targeted towards vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is really individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, President of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" priority must now be that the study will be done quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk of HIV will be left behind. "</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that prep test medicine has been procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Health Minister, said:" "the start of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and stop the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that they will contribute to the completion of the spread of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living the big life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former banker with a passion for real estate, fell into Earls Court apartment in 2014 by a big Knightsbridge house."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne hasn't packed and sold her pockets.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much bigger room," Joanne says. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I looked for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">"I was shown this apartment in Earls Court, and it had the same high ceilings."</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first visit, the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted Joanne closet space and an mezzanine to use the generous ceiling height optimally.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, lots of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my requirement," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two spaces above each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">"Erfan had to think creatively, to solve the issue."</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel works are quite complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other, without having to bend."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not just about building a simple platform, but creating the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function at the top or bottom."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with much additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper light window from Retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold furniture, silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"at both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window in another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the cutlery and jars of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering went inside," explains Erfan of the steel reinforced, veneered MDF-door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important, so it is very easy to slide when you push the door."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the soil size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they have managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"" "you don't love the electrical outlets in the walls."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square footage of some standard into something completely amazing.</seg>

<seg id="1356">"two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty, in a dispute because of one of the largest real estate-empire Victorias worth more than 500 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1357">"the former director of the 'Carlton Football Club' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak, only three doors from his younger brother Paul."</seg>
<seg id="1358">Paul wanted to retire from family business since 2014 but a sharp dispute about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court.</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a shop in Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">There the family founded Westco jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores.</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold for 85 million US dollars in 1999.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city rum, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her late father Colin - by Paul as" the main operator and the dominating personality "described in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of the company's assets and Paul, about one third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">A court case states that this means that Colin's property has a value of $316 million and Paul has a value of $176 million.</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the departments proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the Supreme Court's first hearing took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the Brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but rejects Paul to manage some possessions incompetently."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit, which was submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage dictates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"costs increase in the event, with hundreds of pages with Affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, among them Allan Myers, QC, and from both parties held law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Mrs. De Lutis and her husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated Milky Bars and Delikatessen business from the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early 1970's."</seg>
<seg id="1374">They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family.</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says that he started West co there when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi said often to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "she wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of De Lutis Group, and Colin claims that Mark has paid $10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark were, so Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">"Colin kept back very much, although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from the year 2015 of Eddie McGuire the best friend of television stars."</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">Only Colin replied by SMS to say "I really can't say much" because the case is in front of the courts.</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw up our surname by the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">In mid-2016 Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother's demands.</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end up in our current dispute," "he said and added that he" "still hope for a solution." ""</seg>
<seg id="1386">"on Friday, this hope seemed to be over."</seg>
<seg id="1387">"our affair will be solved in the near future by the courts," Colin wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1388">Trump's new Chief of Staff is planning to limit the President's media abstinence.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly may actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the White House's new Chief of Staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump, including reports of news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more consistent course."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House met at his first working day with leading employees, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House, which he wanted to repair: poor information coming into the hands of the President."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would obtain good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship with television goes back decades - and now, where he is in the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"when candidate Trump was upset because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage of jobs that were too convincing," said the former election campaign, Sam Nunberg, in February. "</seg>
<seg id="1399">"Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keeping trump's Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaigners, insists that his personal media consumption includes a steady lobbying. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">"but the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever" under control, "is ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="1402">Maybe these campaign officials don't know what we do not know - that Trumps Tweets would have even more combustible stuff without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his collaborators have made it a few times to keep anger from him, then their efforts have paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently prevented Trump Controllsen.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, try again and again to present their own agenda by presenting trump material that may promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - dealing with this story - reported in May about the predilection of the advisers, the president for strategic reasons dubious information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press sections, especially those with shameful leaks, and that he can find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"exactly this happened at the end of February when someone maliciously accused the president of a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com, the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a heap of leaks "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for shkanen, or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he has given wrong accusations in the past and revoke her."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking staff about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House, Rob Porter," tried to implement a system in order to manage and document the paperwork which trump has received. "</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as an effective manager as Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1430">"they brought horses, babies and an army of transporters after they were kicked out only in May, but without being deterred by a trench excavated by the Council in order to prevent their seizures."</seg>
<seg id="1431">The tactful group found a gap in the defense posts and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">"the angry residents have pushed the Council of Solihull, who said that it was" useless to deal with the problem. ""</seg>
<seg id="1433">"an anonymous inhabitant said:" "they went there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones onto the passers-by."</seg>
<seg id="1434">"the Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement it, as it was useless when dealing with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1435">"the travellers were there in May, were moved on and are now back."</seg>
<seg id="1436">"more arrived yesterday evening, probably even more today."</seg>

<seg id="1444">Birkenhof will be Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise becomes.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente operating company ltd. on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenue from the tourist tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the fall of 2014, in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district, the hotel building was offered as collective accommodation, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">The decision was not undisputed at that time in the Municipal Council.</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but above all, Freudenstadt's mayor Julian Osswald defended the site of the hotel, and at that time he spoke of serious interest in the house."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should keep right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"hot Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"at the former Hotel Birkenhof there have been building shuttles in front of the entrance for a long time, and when you enter the house it becomes clear what extensive renovations are to be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were torn out, ceilings partly broken down, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still a lot to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice hotel," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are built."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "beautiful" "later, as Thomas Scherer expresses."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery out."</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room are part of the equipment."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"you will not be able to position yourself at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already on an upscale city level, Scherer gets stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise, with its approximately 60 rooms, wants to set up wide, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or businessmen will feel at ease in the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already held talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause, so shaver."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The city's ideas were identical with those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"after the amount of investment required, Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just under a million euros, he reckons."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the exterior installations are also brought to the fore, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard there is a large terrace, which is accessible from the restaurant that is open to the public."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia-Affair: us Special Offers Submit Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia-Affair around US President Donald Trump, special educator Robert Mueller is said to have used a so-called grand jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"over the past few weeks, the Board has taken up the work, wrote the" Wall Street Journal "on appeal to persons entrusted with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper counted the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The radio station CNN reported that there were already first charges of the committee in connection with a meeting between Trump's oldest son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">U.S. secret services have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time to purge into the 2016 presidential election campaign.</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller studied whether there were agreements between the Trump election team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigations, several men are to stand who acted as advisors to the republicans in the election campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to report, Mueller also examined more and more Trumps as a private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the special investigator Trump was personally involved in the centre and accused the accusation whether the President could possibly hinder the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand Juries is to check this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether to be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Juries are therefore also called the Indictments of the Indictment.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when they are larger and controversial."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The Panel can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge persons for the interrogation under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN, pre-invitations have already been issued, which revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">Those who were involved in the meeting were asked for a statement and said it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">Next to Trump Jr. Trumps also served as adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his official election campaign Paul Manafort.</seg>
<seg id="1498">"on Thursday evening, legal experts reported that Mueller would not intimidate himself in his work and that he should be quick to act fast in his work."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of new revelations, the President made a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia story is a total invention," said Trump. "</seg>
<seg id="1503">The subject gives the Democrats an opportunity to "feel good" because they have nothing else to talk about.</seg>
<seg id="1504">His Special Advisor Ty Cobb stated in a statement that he did not know anything about the insertion of a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but I usually work in secret, he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House fears every action that accelerated the work of the special agent in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI chief James Comey told three times that not against the President.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"one has no reason to assume that something has changed, it said in the explanation."</seg>
<seg id="1509">"however, Mueller had only been used after Trump Comey had fired."</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this accusation, accusations against Trump had become loud, he would impede the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"in June, Comey issued a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up the investigations against the former national security adviser Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure because of the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"following the presentation of US media, the White House collected material against the special agent and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculations on whether he wanted to release Trump Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent special agent of the Congress, like in the Watergate affair about the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the urge of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"on Thursday, two groups of republican and democratic senators presented legislators on Thursday that the special agent could not be dismissed so easily."</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctica: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the West Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg from the barely seven-fold size of Berlin has detached from the Schelfeis."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was divided by the Bremerhavener Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the colossus of more than 1 trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres of large colossus is now driving to the north and will probably need two, three years until it is melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest ice giant that researchers have registered over the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to human beings.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"as far as climate change has played a role in the abortion of the iceberg, research is unclear."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"however, there have been a series of unusual breakdowns in the region for about 30 years, writes the U.S. research center for snow and ice (NSIDC) in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"according to many researchers, this could be related to global warming."</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now broken colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelfeis floats on the sea and is fed by big glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">"thus, it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly."</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this horseshoe, the equilibrium of waxes and abort was disturbed a few years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">AWI-researcher Daniela Jansen writes a complete horseshoe.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a good talk about the fact that the Larsen C Schelfeiture is in danger, as the front edge has never been as far back as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice sheet is under tension and can be disintegrated if a piece breaks down at a key point."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea level since they float on the water and ice as much water as it results after melting.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the ice shelf leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow much faster than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase the level of sea level, but only to a lesser extent, the British research project for the observation of Antarctica (Midas) writes."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI data with almost 50 000 square kilometres, the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth-largest shelf of Antarctica."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the transition from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the iron sign is now in a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary from British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the most serious retreat since the beginning of records," he also affirmed. "</seg>
<seg id="1543">"scientists have argued that the Larsen C Schelfeiture will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly coincide," said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added: "our models say that it will be less stable."</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will take decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers don't bring back the demolition of this gigantic iceberg to climate change, there have been a lot of melting in the Antarctic Peninsula in recent decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of Antarctica stretches in the direction of South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to the research program British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has decreased by 28,000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The increase in temperature contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed up around three degrees in the past 50 years and count towards the areas where the temperature is fastest.</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions, the CDU demands to step out of the employers' association to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"just before the summer break, 41 new jobs have been pushed through in the administration."</seg>
<seg id="1553">More than 1100 employees and officials work for the administration in Mettmann.</seg>
<seg id="1554">"now, 17 trainees have their first working day behind them."</seg>
<seg id="1555">The teachers in the circle are apparently very much sought after.</seg>
<seg id="1556">Around 620 applications were registered for the places to be announced this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle is still lacking personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"at present, there are still 50 unoccupied places in the circle of Mettmann."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the request of the parties, the administration is to develop a concept for human resources and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is not only to cover short-term requirements for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortage."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orient itself internally and externally, show concrete measures for climbers and involve an education campaign, call for CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise well officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">The speech is of a veritable "competition of public employers."</seg>
<seg id="1568">"for this purpose, a high number of employees, who leave the service for disease or age, come out of the service."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"so high time to act, so that no more jobs will remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Peoples, president of the CDU, goes beyond the common request with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">"he was already worried about a bad surprise in the circle of the working day, when he questioned the staff cost-caps publicly and amazed the remaining parties."</seg>
<seg id="1572">"people want all possibilities to be verified, which enable a withdrawal from the local employers' association."</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we don't come to a satisfying solution at short notice, the circular management with the trade unions - perhaps in co-operation with the county-related cities - should aspire to a Haustarif," "said Peoples."</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in this way, the CDU tries to better pay the employees and officials when it actually envisages the tariff for public service."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"salaries are currently exactly prescribed, increases or more money are only available when one changes to a higher level that is oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more over the past years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act."</seg>

<seg id="1580">"Italy has warned NGOs that use lifeboats for migrants in the Mediterranean, warned that they cannot continue this if they do not adhere to new rules for their operations."</seg>
<seg id="1581">"if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct, it is difficult to see how they can continue to work," said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa. "</seg>
<seg id="1582">Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German Relief Organisation 'Youth Rettet' because their crew worked effectively with traffickers in a manner that facilitated illegal immigration.</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the aid organisation, which has only been in operation for one year, refused to speak to the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio in detailed allegations."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"for us, the saving of human life remains our top priority. so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," said the organization in an opinion on the social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can only evaluate all accusations that are currently being raised, after collecting all the information and assessing the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of" Youth Rettet, "the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is presumed that its crew takes dinghy migrants aboard, which are supplied to them directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can go off so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting took place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's act, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the occupation is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue missions in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the code of conduct, boats such as the Iuventa must, above all, have an Italian police officer on board who oversees their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue missions have previously agreed to adhere to the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary, but acceptable as they would not bring" major changes or disabilities "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">"among those who refuse to sign, Nobel laureate organisation doctors are without borders (MSF)."</seg>
<seg id="1594">"in the meantime, Minniti said that the number of migrants who arrived after the emergency measures in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors bear fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in recent days, we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the Minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens in this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in hope to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Biker, the" "Berlin outpost" "and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palatinate for four days to enjoy trials and sightseeings."</seg>
<seg id="1599">"for this, three friendly guides were available."</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour took place at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there were viewpoints, partly on towers, of which one could see far above the Pfälzer forest and the upstream levels."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were always longer ascents, for the long trials."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and to the folk festival sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"again there was a lookout spot at the lookout spot, connected by" flogged "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days a lot of altitude difference was announced.</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">"in Bad Dürkheim, the bikers breathed saline brine in the open air inhalatorium."</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was also controlled.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group had met the Pfälzer Wald from its very best side - sporty and culturally."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of grass - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">"in future, the sport stars are sitting in front of computer consoles, instead of sweating through the stadium in the wind and weather?"</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-Sport has long become a serious business, becoming a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gagen included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"this has also been recognised by the first federal liganations, who are increasingly involved in this area."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sports division in mid-July and signed two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">It is certain that there are still several clubs on this train.</seg>

<seg id="1620">"in addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Also Robin Dutt sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"in particular, real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds that young people still go to the stadium in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets, especially the Asian ones."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent electric sportsmen under contract, one could be more often present on these markets online than just sending the federal budget to Asia once a year."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in the E-sport, computer games such as" League Of Legends, "" Dota 2, "" Counterstrike "or even football simulation FIFA are being challenged at competitive level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in normal sports, Ligen has long since become established in which the pros are competing against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and with the Asian games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it a real sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is certainly getting used to getting used to."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Frobatic has long been dealing with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"for Professor at the German Sports College in Cologne, E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and show many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example, increased heart rate, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding, need a quick response."</seg>
<seg id="1635">"professional gamers should exercise not only on the console, but also their body and pay attention to the diet."</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the frank player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"but the stromal also sees some problems:" "doping is becoming more and more a topic."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls are difficult to carry out in online games, and in the scene the structures of classical sport failed."</seg>
<seg id="1639">"positively, the scientist raises the high integrative effect of e-sport."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the go international, that's like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study by the Deloitte business consultancy and the Federal Association Interactive entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth.</seg>

<seg id="1643">"in three years, turnover is expected to exceed 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, that is not enough."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport is no longer far from the other established sports such as handball, basketball or ice hockey," write the Deloitte consultant. "</seg>

<seg id="1662">"a woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years, because she encouraged her boyfriend to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months behind bars and five years were exposed to probation."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was sentenced in June for the negligent killing of Conrad Roy who took life on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is uncomforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured blouse, Carter stood with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and downward pointing eyes, when she was condemned."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"her actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she took no responsibility," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has not shown any remorse."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "awful circumstance that they fully regret.</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz, however, said he did not find out that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness had a significant impact on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a public prosecutor read a statement by Roy's mother Lynn Roy, who said that there is" no day when I don't lose the loss of my beloved son. ""</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how to deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, in spite of all my pain we will carry for eternity."</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was" "persecuted" "by the knowledge that she would never take part in her brother's wedding or be an ante for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth, is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent, since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask someone to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy found dead of a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case drew national attention, after Carter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang yourself up, jump from a building, get up yourself, I don't know there are many ways," she said in several messages that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on vacation with his family. "</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote:" "you must do it, Conrad" "and" "Everything you need to do is turn off the generator and you'll be free and happy."</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said that Carter's attention was looking through the death of Roy and ordered that she should profit from the case by any press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">Amanda Knox belonged to the few who defended Carter in 2007 for murder of her British roommate in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago.</seg>

<seg id="1699">"so, who was chosen to take the inheritance of Lahm, a little extra motivation can only be used well."</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kime confirmed: "this is what you want as a player: take responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old took over the field as a mini-Lecture."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"at the right rear, this is now his position, the white bandage on the arm did her rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and at all, Kime worked in this start-up as the one who can also take the helm in his hand."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to direct the unrehearsed troop."</seg>
<seg id="1705">He had a look at the whole while many others were busy with himself.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal to overplay his missing fitness (barely flipped); Renato Sanches with it, on devils come out to the services of the Asia-trip (also only partly because); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with it, in their first appearance in the Bavarian tricot not to fall negatively."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"after all, it worked quite well."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"Süle ran beside Kime, Rudy in front of the defense, both acted confidently."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the well-known Napoli storm is often difficult, and Süle also tried a few times in the build-up."</seg>
<seg id="1710">His colleague Rudy admitted that the result wasn't as we were hoping for.</seg>
<seg id="1711">But he also showed a decent performance during the debut.</seg>
<seg id="1712">"game storage, tempo change:" "for this style, I was also fetched."</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as usual this Bavarian-World is still for the newcomers, one saw in the connection to the game."</seg>
<seg id="1714">"for example, Rudy did not give one or two in the catacombs, but definitely six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kime said goodbye after some crunchy statements in the back of his new fellow players.</seg>

<seg id="1726">"it was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate."</seg>
<seg id="1727">This is shown after more than a year in which the new economic minister Volker Wissing (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V request of a change in economic policy - and simultaneously blame the old minister.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Enterprise (VTU), says:" "Wissing attacks the wishes of the economy, which Lemke has all blocked."</seg>
<seg id="1730">"the biggest downturn looks like in the infrastructure policy: the gap in the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list."</seg>

<seg id="1732">"the country also plays a role in the country's plans, which is in the urgent need of the federal transport plan."</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the aim is to take the course into operation in December 2020, says ministerial spokeswoman Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>

<seg id="1756">"nitrogen oxides, emitting diesel engines, are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma."</seg>
<seg id="1757">"the cost of automakers to install systems for neutralising the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles, too, also increases what makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive."</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of harassing the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">"companies are trying to avoid the failures of Volkswagen that were able to regulate the use of so-called shut-off devices, which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but driving back in normal driving conditions."</seg>

<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence, said:" the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to climate change in the past years, which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn.

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to check their plans for reporting about the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime, corrupt officials and incessant drug wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists discuss what feels safer: they should take their children to the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a table at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary, perceptions and abdominal feelings suffice."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists who are suspected of standing on the payroll of the government or cartels, a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no break of violence, and while the corpses are accumulating throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25 years since President Enrique Pena Nieto has been in office in December 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs. "</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the 1930s, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wear t-shirts that show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamanian hat."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared topics, the trauma, their nightmares, insomnia, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a special prosecutor was established in 2010 in order to process the cases of journalists, it has only launched two criminal proceedings, according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of killings associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to justice."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"at Riodoce, they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, even though they are inconsolable and even though the terrain is now more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss safety has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very foolish to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we mistrust everyone."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"on the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot at him, probably because of the name of the newspaper, which is translated with" twelve river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The Sagittarius drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two grown-up children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumors tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest in the United States last year and the delivery to the United States in January, Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa one or more people are shot on the street every day or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-story mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">Remember for a minute that there is a state of "tranquility" if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable harbours and drug trading routes in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first of all, in February, there was the publication of an interview with Damo Lopez, a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this release may have angered the children, presumed gangsters purchased every copy of the issue as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was to force Valdez, after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, to leave the country for its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">"in 2003 he worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste, when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the intoxicant problem, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper earned a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">"reporters loved to be able to publish hard works without fear of censorship, and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat."</seg>
<seg id="1849">Eight years after the establishment of Riodoce she was awarded the prestigious "Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize" for her coverage in Latin America.</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez gained the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists in the pursuit of Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," "he said at the time of the CPJ award."</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life," "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You must take over the task that you as a journalist falls - either that or you play the dummy.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what did you do in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Ridolce team missed Valdez, the fun-bird, who could curse like a dockworker, a friend who was generous with hugs and advice, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit there at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">Now they ask: was his love for routine his ruin?</seg>
<seg id="1861">His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they best deal with their work and stay alive.</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like to deal with their wives, their children, their clean shops, their secret runways and runways to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," said Bojorquez. "</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"the anger is, the editor of the Feodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be fooled... and then the thing happens with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as not in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes, weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the space where the staff from Riodoce met for safety training, there were suddenly no mobile phones. days before it became known that Spyware, which is sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">"outside, two policemen were looking for protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shade of a tree."</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the state government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 percent of the police officers whom the governor himself was not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it is months since the reporters have gone into the mountain landscape, where drug gangs are de facto under control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">"for the issue of this week, Ridolce licked on three main stories."</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the murder of brother of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">"they also had an exposé to the state spending, concentrating on the hometown of the governor."</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group that in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block away from the office of the prosecutor, carried out a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened, so caution was offered when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows: that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), which ruled nearly the whole century all the political levels."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption in high-calibre cases."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"just a few months earlier, the readers of Valdez had viewed the column of Valdez as the best informed source of kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"we used to know what happened before," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "El Flaco" "because of his slender body stature."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office became a storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists, because the employees have become something they had never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few notes and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist for the office of the prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">A burnt body was discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is its.</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become louder by written down in organized protests" SOS Press "on pavements and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on this day, director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gain international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities to spy on journalists and to leave them because they said the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"since then, she has asked her to be restructured by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime, involved government officials and a uniform society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on the order of politicians and security forces who were hiding under a blanket with organised crime."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media fan group" Articulo 19 "has assigned more than half of the attacks on journalists of the police and civil servants."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico die you die, because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found together with a note that was supposedly signed by the Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphone were beside her separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">"some branches have chosen to close, such as El Norte's newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslav Breach in March."</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of her director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the title page with the heading" What do you want from us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and look for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who stay behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admitted that the drug trade was frightened."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and that's why I became reporter," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue was already finished, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones began to sum up."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shootings with belt rivets and security forces near the resort Mazatlan had left behind 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated on as promised by a series of cartel embassies in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the curb edge, they published the news on the website of Feodoce via mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens howled nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were ready.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they did not show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the powerful portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you remember," "said Bojorquez," "when the same day Javier was murdered, the trainee asked me to send her to the street."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a scary."</seg>
<seg id="1924">"now, researchers have found out that the first findings of the incredible rashort of a Canadian miners have been preserved so well that experts described it as" Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs. ""</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so good that they could even find that his flaky skin was of reddish brown - and they said that she had had something of a" "troubled past". ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described him as" the spared armored dinosaur, who was ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">"the fossil is a newly discovered species of nodose-dinosaurs, who lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period from 110 million and 112 million years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"its incredibly well-preserved state has amazed researchers who describe it as" "really remarkable", ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">According to National Geographic reports the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind.</seg>
<seg id="1930">"it was found by Shawn Funk, when he founded on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something that seemed to be out of the surrounding rock at the place, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossil discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"they spent the next six years to uncover the wild beast within the 2,500 Pound (1,100 kg) heavy peanklets."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you blindfolded a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it has slept," said the chief author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="1936">"it will go into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur exemplars - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found out that this plant-eater, although it is covered with armor and resembles a moving tank, was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique, which is known as a counterpoint, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed to interfere with his surroundings and evade his enemies, experts say, suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now to be seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and Borealopelta marmitchelli named Markabchelli named after the museum engineer Mark Mitchell, one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours to discover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the top of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter shading is common, the results are surprising as the size of Borealopelta by far exceeds the animals living today."</seg>
<seg id="1945">"it suggests that dinosaurs were hunted by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs, that evolution encouraged the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival."</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter shading - think of deer, zebras or belt-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signalizes that this nodose-dinosaur was exposed to a real battle for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous period have been", "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to investigate the animal in evidence of his life, including his conserved bowel content to find out what it eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and drove out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today, and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodose-dinosaur is really remarkable, because it is completely covered with preserved flaky skin, but remains intact in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal," "said Brown."</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that the animal looks almost as same today as in the early Cretaceous time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it. if you just shoot a bit with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is at sleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous Time was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, stood on two legs, passed through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions years after Borealopelta, the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monster."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he founded on March 21, 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the painted dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long lace mounted from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">"the researchers believe that the armored plant-eater was swam through Western Canada, until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea."</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the dinosaur's underwater equipment kept its armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The petrified remains of this particular specimen are preserved so well that the hoods cover still bumpy tank panels along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of conservation is as rare as winning the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I approach it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy plating plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right front foot rests on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales at his sole.</seg>

<seg id="1977">"a police spokesman said it was moderate to moderate violations, said a police spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1978">A large number of emergency vehicles were charged at the accident site.</seg>

<seg id="1995">"currently, a test operation is running on two routes."</seg>
<seg id="1996">"if the offer comes, we extend it."</seg>
<seg id="1997">"it will likely be available at many other long-distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year," "said a railway spokesman."</seg>
<seg id="1998">"" "comfort Check-in" "is the name of the railway."</seg>
<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use it, however, some requirements must be met: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what already most passengers do.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"you also have to have it over the app of the railway, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient type of ticket booking."</seg>
<seg id="2002">And last but not least you need a seat reservation.</seg>

<seg id="2013">"for many times, however, one of the travelling companions does not have all the documents required for the devaluation of online tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2014">Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to point out is missing.</seg>
<seg id="2015">"the result is endless discussions between train attendant and passenger, which leads to a bad mood in the compartment or large space and delays in checking his own tickets and takes the conductor at the end of the time to take care of other concerns."</seg>
<seg id="2016">Only a small number of test customers can use the new service.</seg>

<seg id="2021">"only one day after having arrived in New York City, the apartment in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an airbnb apartment they rented and scrolled through Facebook on their phone."</seg>
<seg id="2022">She stumbled over a post by someone from High School.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"the police have just killed a 18-year-old child, and it is still on the road," "said it there."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused as nobody else had posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly reportedly prayed on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweets the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white police officer in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted an image of Browns lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She left her cell phone to return to Tweet on the Canfield-Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of the police band and people crying out, and by a man claiming to be his father, who wore a sign with the inscription:" "Ferguson's police has just killed my unarmed son!"</seg>
<seg id="2032">"she watched a live feed, in which a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a barking dog."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video, she said, another policeman secured his gun and shouted," "I'm going to kill you... animals all."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," Ferrell remembered her testimony. "</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have become accustomed to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At that moment I felt shivering.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and wept. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">"after landing at 23 o'clock, she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father's house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning."</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the topic of a new documentary," Whose Streets?, "in the cinemas from the 11th century."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of people who live in the community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a matching crown to Ferguson, the two spoke a conversation that they had" "black experience and the black condition" "countless times before this morning."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she remembered what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">"we are now going to Ferguson, because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right."</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her with me," Ferrell said later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What is happening today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know and see it and be drawn up in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution and what we have to do to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I am lucky enough to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any blatant racism, she is not different from the next black women child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her away from it.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority, which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch.</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"after August 9, my activism has changed completely," she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food-justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organizing.</seg>
<seg id="2057">Everything has come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later, Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan, one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar wanted to" "document" "what happened."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came to her mind:" "do you want to document or try to find a story that you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently. "</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan already collaborated with the co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt insiders."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years following Browns's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us. we're talking," said Davis. "</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, as these people are represented, for so I am going to be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferris's experience - to show that the movement" is not a messiah leader, but a community coming together, "Folayan said - it turned out to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents of" Whose Streets "show surprising personal aspects of Ferrara's life as she falls in love with her wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I understand that there must be a certain vulnerability in this work and for the dehumanisation of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferris's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the Movement, who after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin have shaped the film" "Blacklive Matter" "in social media in 2012, identify themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement in total," Ferrell said, "and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women have to bear the brunt of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"Folayan agreed to note that" "the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmative type of action, "when Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to its identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook up this energy," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is no accident, although she was at the front, because in a life at these crossings as a black, gay woman is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on parole for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">She describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area she calls her home: "a chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"nevertheless, she clings to a chant and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the road three years ago in Ferguson."</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love each other and support each other.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "dream" to megalomania: TV readers discuss bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves the people, even though it is not built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian precinct collapsed since the first presentation in 2009 the population in advocates and opponents.</seg>
<seg id="2091">The topic scarcely lets the issue get cold.</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the Bit Gallery say," This would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be really great "(Nicole Schausten), comes from the other side:" no man needs "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers to the city, from which the rest of the shops profit, the opponents fear that the pedestrian precinct is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property where the farmers market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketers offer their products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"at the beginning of the construction work, it will be concluded."</seg>
<seg id="2097">The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - and to Beda-Platz with possibility to sit outside.</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been shopping in the farmers market almost every week for many years now.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the landlady again and again very gladly."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher's shop we discovered for ourselves.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is also this."</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the Kleinmarkthalle in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery refers to the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">This should probably not be very low in the new project. "</seg>
<seg id="2106">Eva Kilic: "what are the shopping palaces in Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I find that superfluous."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is plenty of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years.</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not even a good weekly market here, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains to us."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the commodity offered there is fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is well-priced at the top."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shop stores are rented in a shopping mall only by larger companies, because the rentals there are often not acceptable for a retailer."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"a pity, special deals are almost no longer and what is left of it will probably disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall doesn't fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where to go the farmers market hall during construction?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery is actually coming up sometime.</seg>
<seg id="2118">"or does the specter Bit-Galerie already create, to expel all business from Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2119">"George Marquet:" "this will simply not work."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which stands empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion, it would have been better to have a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insanely many - as I find - there is no more room for senseless construction projects in Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"when the farmer's market is broken, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York, many faces are to be seen - white, black and brown, almost unnoticable - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">"the 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg, the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison, where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year prison sentence after making publicly stuffed diplomatic reports about the WikiLeaks website."</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, which was opened on August 2, is called A Becoming resemblance (a suitable similarity)."</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combines its expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transwoman and a dissident, whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"through the algorithmic analysis of DNA that was extracted by Manning, Dewey-Hagborg created a sharp, albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only to the forms of DNA data - the many ways that they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but had already spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, among them six transgressions against the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"through the prison her image was suppressed, so much that there was only one photo - a grainy, black-white selfie, in which Manning is obviously sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette dummies and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people might look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed, so you contacted Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"the artist and her imprisoned muse became too heterogeneous, which in the course of two years exchanged several letters."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a comic" "Suppressed Images" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future in which the President of the Overseas would be converting judgment and that it would be able to personally see the exhibition."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"that Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, Manning would demand release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy meeting."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also now at the opening of the exhibition something deep and strong, since Donald Trump is leading a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new tweetable ways to flaming up the rigid splits he should actually fix."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. ""</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery, Manning called on its oversized signature (the" i "in its surname is equipped with a heart) an end of the" automatic fragmentation, "the basis of gender, race, sexuality and culture."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall, their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandler of Cs and Gs and As, is written in pencil."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by the inclusion of the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific lexicon of the artist), as amazing, at least in biological terms, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome doesn't care who we are and how openly genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, too. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above mentioned comic-novelle."</seg>
<seg id="2149">She shows Manning how she appears with a hands-free phone in his hand from the disciplinary field of the United States as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they let down your speech, they have won", "it says."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so, never stop the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, who greeted me from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning hasn't seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it, then it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulations, which are like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted, like everything in the exhibition, to the size (5" 2, Manning Statur), where their genetic haplogroups were written with a pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee at Oxford University for killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">"a nationwide human race is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an Oxford University staff, who are looking for suspects after a man had been stabbed to death in a luxurious apartment in Chicago."</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, for Wyndham Lathem (42) and Andrew Warren (56) arrest warrants were issued for murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, such as the acts of the Local Court of Cook County."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">"a common warning system published by the police authority of Chicago, states that the corpse was discovered on July 27."</seg>
<seg id="2163">"officials received a call, arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body."</seg>
<seg id="2164">"Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the scene of the events, and detectives examine the stitches as murder while the police actively seek the two suspects, officials said."</seg>
<seg id="2165">"since 2007, Lathem has been Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2166">"Alan K. Cubism, the vice president for university relations, said in an e-mail explanation that Lathemis now being apprehended and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University."</seg>
<seg id="2167">"this is now a criminal case, which is examined by the competent authorities, and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="2168">Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University.</seg>
<seg id="2169">"a spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail that" "we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the US investigative authorities in every possible way."</seg>
<seg id="2170">The statement added that Warren's colleagues were shocked and want him to be shocked.</seg>
<seg id="2171">"chief Communication Officer of the Chicago Police Department, Anthony Guglielmi, said he strongly urged the suspects to face the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the police have an idea of their whereabouts, and our efforts to locate them reinforce," said Guglielmi. "</seg>
<seg id="2173">"Guglielmi said local, regional and national authorities will help to find the suspects."</seg>
<seg id="2174">"Guglielmi said the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building, who had just received a puzzling tip that said something happened in apartment 1008."</seg>
<seg id="2175">The police described the scene as very cruel.</seg>
<seg id="2176">"said Guglielmi, it is unclear whether the incident took place on July 27."</seg>
<seg id="2177">It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2178">"we believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship," said Guglielmi. "</seg>

<seg id="2181">Russian deputy minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not last long before the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (RUSADA).</seg>
<seg id="2182">"in a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap, RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD (UK Anti-Doping)."</seg>
<seg id="2183">"the WADA roadmap was updated in this respect," mutko declared on Thursday. "</seg>
<seg id="2184">The PM commented on the second part of WADA's roadmap to comply with the code that describes the criteria for reintegration of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization's website.</seg>
<seg id="2185">"according to Mutko, he does not include anything that could cause concern for Russia."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"everything has been announced, everything is being implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"and the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"one of the criteria mentioned in the list, however, is that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sports."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in relation to the matter, Mutko said," We carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system has made a mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programs, and we will not admit anything that does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="2192">"Mutko's words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov, the leader of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission."</seg>
<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales agency rsport at the beginning of the day, Smirnov made problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but then added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>
<seg id="2194">"no one has to accept this report unconditionally," "said Smirnov."</seg>
<seg id="2195">RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the doping scandal.</seg>

<seg id="2204">"Amy Errett wanted to measure luck at your e-commerce startup, but the surveys didn't work."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"responses were often vague, little helpful or - even worse - fraudulent."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"even if you promised anonymity, some workers did not trust the process."</seg>

<seg id="2209">A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is on growth to help companies find out how their employees feel.</seg>
<seg id="2210">"by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measurement of employee engagement, it enables companies to address surveys, provide specialist groups and demographic groups, provide employees anonymity and complaint hotlines, and in some cases Whistleblowers allow to bypass the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board of Directors."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"they now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for their health, but where is the Fitbit for your company?" said Jim Barnett, co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint, whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees' commitment. "</seg>
<seg id="2212">Rett said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint won.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"in addition to the Snap Surveys and Surveys from certain teams, it provides a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - allowing you to drill down why."</seg>

<seg id="2219">Uber has recently registered as a client.</seg>

<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan ordered a further 7395 prosecutor, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed as if Erdogan had tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly known as the actual masters of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they listened to their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"after his victory in 2002, Erdogan pushed back the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the reform requirements of the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it will not be even more crazy in 2017, a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, actually."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">"recently, the Foundation for Responsible Robotics (Foundation for Responsible Robotics) (FRR) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years."</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we need to start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but the companies deliver a lot of it, and we will see them much more frequently," said Mr Sharkey on the release of his new report. "</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions which are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can" "adapt" "his robot according to his convictions and choose everything from the eye colour of the robot to the shape of the nipples to the type or colour of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that would make a stepford woman progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as timidity."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxy Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personages such as" Frigid Farrah, "which conveys the impression of timidity and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as good as possible," enthuses True Companion's website. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can" "be in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female features, the allusions to rape, when one goes a step on Frigid (i.e. here: reluctant) Farrah, unsettles a most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator but for men.</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men then have no Roxxxy?" "it says on the website."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their formation and increasing refinement indicate somewhat darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men will of course not keep sex robots, and while the FRR remembers their growing popularity, they remain provisionally on the brink of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what transpires from the outskirts, can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market is given permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will appear in a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have attacked women sexually."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most deterrent aspect of the TV series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The Report of the maid ') is not the graphic images, the intricate body and the daughter's eyes, but how realistic this vision is."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel inhumanely that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, to the point when it comes to its" personalities, "the robots are no real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background story, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are forged slaves."</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House everyone who knows it, including the republican kinship, with whom she fought for decades for politics, suddenly and completely strangely on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"to the dining table it is certainly a good thing, but it falls into a further context that this also entails considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" normalization "and Trump, we refer to the vague possibility that one day his bibs will no longer meet us."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is, however, an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans normalize the right wing, which suddenly appears as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today I find myself occupied by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's urfunny version of the crazy - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return) - both compared to Trump in fact occur as very mild criminal offences."</seg>

<seg id="2535">"Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire this year."</seg>
<seg id="2536">The place is already written - but suitable candidates are rar.</seg>
<seg id="2537">"for 31 years, Wacker has been a City Engineer."</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him a lot of fun as he mediates in the press talk.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports from varied, but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it is surprising that up to now no application fulfils the requirements profile."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"in this way, in compliance with the regular periods of notice, there is still enough time for a revision."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach is responsible for the administrative community as the Lower Civil Code, the applicant must present relevant conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if it would no longer be able to fill it, citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but citizens' proximity is important to the city and it itself, says Wacker, who reports from a good working climate and good atmosphere between authority and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, some important projects have accumulated, looking back at the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city worth living," he is confident about the Bauamt and its employees. "</seg>
<seg id="2549">"but also in the future, varied projects are on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla-Areas and the Niederhofen parking lot about are initiated."</seg>
<seg id="2550">"the zigzag bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed, also the stadium renovation is still a topic."</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter alone will be smashed with approximately 1.5 million euros," if we do it right, "Wacker appreciates."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"" "all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"in terms of design, there is plenty of room for a Stadtbaumeister."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslach's own building yard and gardening, many things can be reacted flexibly."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town is listed as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye on what to do, "when new buildings are approved, the outgoing City Builder stresses."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the Stadtbaumeister has a high level of responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a builder," in the end everything runs here over my table. "</seg>
<seg id="2560">He can count on many years of employee support and coordination: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been doing Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) for the past ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also that his successor remains long, Wacker wants:" we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and wanted to stay with the job. "</seg>
<seg id="2562">Continuity is not only important for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city.</seg>
<seg id="2563">Anyone who wants to be buried by Roland Wacker should have a completed course of studies as a diploma engineer or bachelor's degree in architecture according to the city of Haslach and have good knowledge in the areas of construction and construction planning law.</seg>

<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway track crossing in the area of Leobener Straße (B116) on the lines."</seg>
<seg id="2567">They were so badly damaged that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night.</seg>
<seg id="2569">"near the crime scene, witnesses of a scooter and a bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses."</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a Lausbubenreich," said ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch to the APA. "</seg>
<seg id="2571">The perpetrator or the perpetrators had brought himself into great danger and also jeopardized train traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the delay and the costs for rail transport, there could also be sponsors of the railway customers to the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"overall, there was a" substantial "sum to go out, the speaker said."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the south-way route could be led without any obstructions."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"nearly ten people had dropped off Friday morning, two of which were concerned by the long-distance traffic."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"freight trains failed, but they were late."</seg>
<seg id="2577">"according to ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch, some 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts were also damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help ease IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study claims exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable condition, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhoea, weight loss and extreme tiredness."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while sufferers are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms, researchers found at the Washingtoner University that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the leading researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, stated that immune cells in the gut are patrolling in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to trigger inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissues."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, an inflammatory bowel disease may result."</seg>
<seg id="2587">Experiments have been found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell in mice occurs which carry a certain bacterium in its intestines.</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">"Professor Colonna said:" "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome, and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan the mice had in their food, the more they had of these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote intolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus when the same system works with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance, when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was accommodated separately, did not."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference was to do with the intestinal microbiome of mice - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastro-intestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were found six species of bacteria present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">"mice were taken up in a sterile environment, so that an intestinal microbiome was missing and they did not develop this type of immune cells, and they were created by L. reuteri and immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2596">"to understand how bacteria develop on the immune system, the researchers led L. reuteri to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - to unripe immune cells isolated from mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed to the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was purified from the liquid, it turned out to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as an idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"if the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the feed of mice, the number of cells increased by around 50 percent, but when tryptophan were halved, the number of cells decreased by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells such as mice and that most of us protect L. Cross-teri in our gastrointestinal tract.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether Tryptophan byproducts from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as well as mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">"she said," "The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote since these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine."</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2676">"back then, in the renovation area I from 1991 to 2004, the Land of Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amount."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still at 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, the previous renovations are a" success project "- it is important to promote inner development, not only to open up new areas of construction."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on April 4, I received the information from the government president Karlsruhe that there will be a remediation area III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the sum of the funding amounts to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 euro come from the country, the rest of the congregation's sensitivities."</seg>
<seg id="2681">How does a remediation area come into being?</seg>
<seg id="2682">"one will continue to investigate, as Schindler, where the" "really old" "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">But it also plays a role as to whether in the planned area there is any interest in sanitation.</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the area borders could also be moved again."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"the bridge represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"cellar presented the contents of the federal state programme" "Soziale Stadt," "in which the renovations would then be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"the core of the program is the revitalisation of inner cities, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be carried out in an object-related manner, i.e. per plot."</seg>
<seg id="2689">The remediation area would then finally be defined as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">"since 1 January 2017, the funding period for the funding will expire until 30 April 2026."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"until September this year, however, the survey would be carried out only once, within the framework of those involved in the rehabilitation area to fill a questionnaire for filling out."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, the statute of the statute shall be carried out in order to begin with the renovations in the coming year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"afterwards, Pietzschmann stated that each commune must carry out the aforementioned pre-investigations."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"it is a question of assessing and determining the urban grievances, when it is rehabilitated and to what extent."</seg>
<seg id="2695">For the respective property there is also a sanitation memorandum in the land register.</seg>
<seg id="2696">"Pietzschmann will come again after feeling and make a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">A key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="2698">"for this reason, questionnaires will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" building and property sheet, "in which, among other things, it is about the constructional state and the renovation prospects."</seg>
<seg id="2700">"in the gray questionnaire, the" "household and housing", "details about size, layout and habitants of a residential space can be made."</seg>
<seg id="2701">The blue "Operation arc" is only to be filled out when operating rooms in the building.</seg>
<seg id="2702">"however, to be noted, Gotzel pointed out that a filled out questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding."</seg>
<seg id="2703">"in addition, new construction measures are not eligible."</seg>
<seg id="2704">Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the feed means working according to the "greyhound principle" - who first comes first grinding first.</seg>
<seg id="2705">You can't reserve funds for later. "</seg>

<seg id="2714">The cost of the White House costs the taxpayers</seg>
<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that raises US production last month, costs taxpayers according to the military personnel who have been left to TIME Magazine, up to $24,000."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the President is on board, was the centrepiece of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"built in Connecticut, next to a yacht from Maine, a firefighter car from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House Military Office demanded the presence of helicopters in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event to his superiors, the deputy naval commander for aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on July 17 at 7 o'clock in the morning, and stayed until the lawn between 18: 00 and 21: 00 was vacated this evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">"the note also adds that if the departure from the White House should be delayed, a second crew for the return flight would be required due to the limitation of service hours."</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter, while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the plane."</seg>
<seg id="2724">The recordings provided by TIME were not clear whether a second flight crew was required in the end.</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act provides federal states to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the destination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commandant wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds like you are locked," said the deputy commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But also official events have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was going on in the Senate, and he propagated the efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of aircraft, known as Navy One or Air Force One, is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But to use their use only for a photo op is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump conducted an investigation as the president of the presidential plane took place against the background of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of messages that complained about the use of the presidential aeroplane by its predecessor."</seg>
<seg id="2736">"the White House is inspired by the show" "Made In America" "- the products from all 50 countries that are produced by American workers with American materials," said the deputy secretary of the White House, Lindsay Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crews frequently perform training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to set the US president in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"as Trump in early July at the G20 summit in Germany, HMX-1 carried out 58 practice landings in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted during the training requirement of the flight crew for the month, said a civil servant."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"helicopter-units flew an additional 11 hours this day for" "non-presiding support missions". ""</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers overtook the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved to issue the helicopter on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not maintain budgetary records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the U.S. Department of Defense for the fiscal year 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24.380 USD per flight hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">The unit records the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operation of the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," said Walters. "</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the yearly funds."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs, but take into account the cost of fuel, maintenance and contract completion."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former press spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things that are made in America this week," said Spicer. "</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">"and I think most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment, for which so many Americans worked tirelessly."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Of course it is reasonable to highlight that.</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter as he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire brigade."</seg>
<seg id="2756">In the White House he spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and shook with the media about his own fleet of company products.</seg>
<seg id="2757">"I know Sikorsky very well," "said the President," "I have three of them."</seg>

<seg id="2890">This means author and historian Michael Hesemann.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report about the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman for the reform movement" We are Church, "announced after publication to the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and today's Cardinal Gerhard Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">It would be very useful to the prestige of the Catholic Church when Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret over their own omissions or their then false appraisal of the processes.</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticised that" double standards "were measured in reporting on violence in the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in regards to the encroachment in Regensburg, no one doubted that it was" shameful and shameful acts, "which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the" degree of media manipulation, "says the author Lucetta Scarstagia, historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already a part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal," said Scarstagia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk, Princess Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said:" we like to go to the church and this is a found fresco. "</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth" "blows a very normal educational tool" "had been," "to cope with cheeky children, as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the misuse cases, Pope's brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"the author and historian Michael Hesemann, who wrote the commemorative tape" My brother of the Pope, "written with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I have to take care of Georg Ratzinger," "says Hesemann," "because all this had nothing to do with him," "he evaluates the results of the final report."</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990s," with high plausibility "victims of attacks, 67 Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is called Georg Ratzinger, who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "in summary, it is possible to conclude that by R. in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence were applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with high emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to numerous other defendants, however, many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in numerous cases, even positive memories are connected with him."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger was relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence exerted at the Regensburger Domspatzen "is a contradictory picture of" "Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger". ""</seg>
<seg id="2910">"to the one hand, many students raise his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleriker and perfectionist, who became more tangible when a Domspatz brought no top performance musically."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you make the effort and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself more about why the name Georg Ratzinger is all about it."</seg>
<seg id="2914">He has just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-knowing in the terrible cases of sexual abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2915">The expropriation of violence at the pre-school was also expropriating outside its sphere of action.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can pretend to experience it too late or have taken initial indications seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the gymnasium on which he worked was felt as literally" "redemption," "" "heaven" "and" "better world" "- literally" "redemption", "" "heaven" "and" "better world". ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"so also the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger describes a very excellent testimony, described him as" warm, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as extremely good-natured teachers, who regularly supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and candy and" always surrounded by clusters of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority complains about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to outbreaks."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"the fact that he did not only knead with chairs and threw the key on the ground, but also pulled off ear badges and pulled too cheeky boys on the hair or ears, he himself had already given years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for that."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"however, it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the late 1960s and 1970s, both in parents and teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you know such breeding methods as well?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think each one of us who was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a state gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is about in this report, namely the terrible sexual abuse and the exodus of violence at the preschool, these are admittedly bagatelles."</seg>
<seg id="2926">One wonders whether or not it is rather familiar with his fame and role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media just rushed to him.</seg>
<seg id="2927">"in the Bavarian pope, many who have never understood him are still working diligently."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report relieves George Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, the media reported a lot about the subject of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Is Georg Ratzinger any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: quite clearly no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">No one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother," "said one person to the other," "It was very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is that most of the victims remain silent.</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they didn't even trust their parents and siblings, then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators professionally."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen students rate Ratzinger's role in terms of misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student put it like this: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he (Georg Ratzinger) had timely knowledge and could have stopped the respective perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to assume that... buben more intrusive or clearer, or more likely to have opened than compared to their parents, dormitory managers, confidence teachers etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That one talks to him about sex... - unthinkable. "</seg>
<seg id="2941">"this is the result of the report on the very clear result:" "in the run-up to affected pupils and / or their environment, the report could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to talk about any involvement."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, he cannot be accused of not having prevented him or brought him to the court."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore there is no reason to link his good name to these conflicting crimes, as unfortunately occurred in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, a lot of" "violence" "was to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of "looking away."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: that's the big problem that everything is mixed and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere, right in the middle of Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">"but this, in turn, is an abuse of the report."</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it is separated cleanly: between the pre-school and the grammar school of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and violence and, let's say, other accusations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report covers incidents from the period since 1945, so also for four decades, in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole awful examination pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were properly slanted and maligned and suffered from them, were all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions must have reigned."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those he had nothing to do with the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger, because he didn't get the boys to face when they were already at the gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on that, as most witnesses emphasise, the theme of" preschool "abou."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to be able to escape and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even paradisiacal states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different on the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, in which the report concludes that" many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases, even positive memories with him. "</seg>
<seg id="2959">"at the most, the accusation remains to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods when it was reported by the states at the preschool."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just begun to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he was not working and responsible (such a witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Is Georg Ratzinger consistently closed ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because already in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral gymnasium who even reproduces the report."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points out this," that in the preschool, the test penalty will continue to be practised. "</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in view of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent intervention."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity was, as test penalties were banned in Bavaria too long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, it took place in a legal grey area, as each of us probably knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult to estimate for him, where the affected people might be exaggerated or dramatized, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">"but you can't say, he has always looked away."</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the punishment of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria of Thurn und Taxis claimed, it was unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see this?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians are talking about the" trap of anachronism, "that is, the danger of assessing the past according to today's moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"then, the princess was right."</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this of course does not apply to sexual abuse, which has been abominable at all times and also not for what has been breached in the preschool of adversity and violence against innocent children's souls, that goes far beyond that at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2977">"this is all awful, and I am glad that it will finally work out."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must protect Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishing, that is, earring and pulling the ears and ears were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"when physical punishment was then banned, he also kept strictly adhering to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his Regensburg's time did Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the talks with you for the book" "My brother of the Pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of test sentence also come to the language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it's about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, told from his perspective, that the Domspatzen only played a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I did not at all admit that he had a strict regiment there."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but also this must be said: without this perfectionism, without demanding discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang, true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with cookies and bonbons alone, you don't even make a great singer from rebellious boys and stand in front of every success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and self-overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of people did you experience as Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond that, I really got to know George Ratzinger very well and again and again experienced as wonderful, humorous, deep-minded, deep-minded and heartfelt people, from which one can't imagine that he could only do something to a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I receive regular contact with how many former Domspatzen still today, 23 years after his emeriding, regularly get in contact with him, visit him, he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he once was strictly to them, are thus clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most of the Domspatzen are thankful to him today that he has enriched their lives and told them the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, paternal teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but also a lovable disrespectful person, to whom they still look and worship them today."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, again, quite clearly: everything you propose to him are educational methods which were at that time on the order of the day."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominent and has a more prominent brother to make a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent that stands behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"for the report, which has just been published, relieves him."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the insurrection would command a 93-year-old man who acquired great merits and, without the outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany, nobody would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, finally in peace."</seg>
