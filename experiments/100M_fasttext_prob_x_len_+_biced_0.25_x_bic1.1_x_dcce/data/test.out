28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping centre .
&quot; the brother of the victim said he could not imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally it went up with him again . &quot;
&quot; the body found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 @-@ year @-@ old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was clas@@ sed as murder and the investigations were on the run .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , informed the ABS transmitter K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who previously worked as a cook in Boston , had his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were &quot; &quot; shocked and destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team who works like a close family and we will miss him , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time at Fran@@ ks &apos;s family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank first lived in Host@@ els , but that &quot; things for him finally went up . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a friend , &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said that he could not imagine anyone who would hurt his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a big heart .
&quot; connecting his family with his family was to always cook something for us to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to take part in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; in everything that goes wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , shining brigh@@ tly every day , &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has the information to the event will be asked to call the SF@@ PD on the number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I &apos;m always plu@@ gged into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t always have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star un@@ ambig@@ u@@ ously clear in an interview .
&quot; I &apos;m always plu@@ gged into drawers or stuck from outside labels , which usually have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I don &apos;t have the desire to be always perfect and successful .
&quot; frank@@ ly , these things are rather dum@@ b . &quot;
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about the fact that she is considered &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan .
&quot; the act@@ ress prefers to spend her time at home , in front of a television with a lo@@ cker@@ less de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , it says in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we women don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; says the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a child &apos;s game &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as an all@@ uring mother of two sons .
the film runs with us starting August 25 .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
&quot; at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa , Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues sought a little di@@ version with a ride on the beach . &quot;
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden World Py@@ ramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted at home in a fast gal@@ lo@@ p home . &quot;
&quot; a kilometer at this speed , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; &quot; says Lan@@ ger . &quot;
and so the riding career ended again .
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he let himself be led with his family about the installation of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even s@@ well for photo purposes . &quot;
&quot; for a long time , the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CH@@ IO . &quot;
the reason was quite convincing .
&quot; the German sports aid handed over to the man from An@@ hausen , as part of a small gala , the Golden World Py@@ ramid . &quot;
there is no lack of awards for the symp@@ athetic sports@@ man .
&quot; Bundes@@ ver@@ dienst@@ kreuz , Silber@@ nes lau@@ rel leaf , champi@@ ons @-@ tour @-@ player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already ordered him .
the 18th pri@@ z@@ ew@@ inner of the sports pyramid is long .
&quot; in Aachen , he met the first lau@@ re@@ ate Hans Günter Win@@ kler on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros in the same way . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was added to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of the German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; athletes Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the Tur@@ ner Eber@@ hard Gi@@ ant , the F@@ echter Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ dder Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the pioneer Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official ceremony , the illustri@@ ous company emig@@ rated to the Spring@@ sta@@ dion , where the Lav@@ azza Prize was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept his distance to the big animals .
Clinton and Tru@@ mps Economic Policy in Com@@ par@@ ison : it &apos;s all about the money
&quot; &quot; &quot; investing in infrastructure and preventing T@@ TP trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question . &quot;
&quot; differences in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton are based on a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
&quot; that , on the role of the state . &quot;
&quot; in doubt , Tru@@ mp wants to keep them small and warn of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself , on the other hand , would be quite different , says Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will greatly go back to regulations , and he is making himself strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , says : the state has to fulfill certain tasks , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged chances and needs money . &quot;
&quot; therefore , taxes would be increased for the rich , it says . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to the topic infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the need to invest , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost immediately . &quot;
the democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War .
state investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state @-@ critical Te@@ apart@@ y wing of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
so there could be no internal discussions on Tru@@ mp .
the differences in energy and climate policy are more evident .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the US .
oil production should also be possible in protected areas in so far as he wants to announce the Paris climate protection agreement .
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend and demand Renew@@ able Energi@@ es with its investment program : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want us to be there . &quot;
&quot; but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ ac@@ tional trade agreement , do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - but rather simply protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; they should also be paid better , say Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a famine .
it wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour .
&quot; what tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to be r@@ ushed , then he says he must not be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop around the tax policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , there is Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth . &quot;
&quot; his critics uph@@ old him , that the budget deficit would be even greater . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton who wants to ask at least from the rich wants them to pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
escape : &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experience with sexual violence &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who flee on their own , almost from everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
in a large kitchen there are four women .
each one has a baby with a maximum of one year old .
one has put her little son in her arms .
he gaz@@ es curi@@ ously into the room with great eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the table top .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you speak with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the Managing Director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria , and deals with the issue of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are poultry .
they live in the northern part of Munich in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for all @-@ frozen women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs set up the institution together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Frau@@ d Aid . &quot;
&quot; recently , it was officially opened . &quot;
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
there are no men - not as visitors .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has experiences on her escape experiences with sexual violence , &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically , because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them to Europe as a hop@@ eful decision . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in women , other reasons out@@ weigh the flight : &quot; &quot; many people secretly steal from it , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland , they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , murder , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
this drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; the fact that tu@@ gs for example require a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; and the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believes that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , er@@ r , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; even here , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be regarded as inferior and ab@@ used in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; this means that around 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily . &quot;
many women are so used to say nothing .
&quot; or they don &apos;t dare to talk openly about the experience , because the shame is too big . &quot;
&quot; since they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodations only need for them , asks B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction , some answer with no . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Ober@@ fran@@ ken , for example , there is no such thing in accommodations of governments . &quot;
&quot; also in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , fled women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , spokes@@ man of the government . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are limited floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations only for women . &quot;
&quot; the Committee on Women &apos;s Rights and Gender E@@ quality , in the European Parliament , also calls for women to be separated from men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the Committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women be accommodated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or men and women are accommodated together , it can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the wash@@ rooms should be separated and easily accessible to women , is in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need of protection can be read from the crowd , which there is to the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since we have talked about it , we have a long waiting list , &quot; B@@ ahr . &quot;
you could easily make a second house .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new work campaigns
representatives of the assistance doctors have called upon their union to appro@@ ve new work campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) required its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work campaigns starting at the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that the ministers agreed to deal with the concerns about the contract .
&quot; in July , resident doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of its members who voted for the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government &quot; persist@@ ently quiet &quot; would have stopped problems , which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; in view of this , the J@@ DC Board agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and request official new negotiations for all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; in response to the silence of the government , the J@@ DC board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating work campaigns starting at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; the controversi@@ es led to the fact that resident doctors saw six times , the first overall failures in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
the head of the BM@@ A resident physician Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana returned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BM@@ A .
&quot; he shared BM@@ A members during the sessions , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 assistant doctors and medical students , with the fact that the contract should be advantageous and accepted . &quot;
&quot; after the vote , the Minister of Health Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t said that the contract for doctors in England would be enforced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and announce an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of St. Petersburg Palace , I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was the hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin &apos;s smile seemed nar@@ rower and he hardly radi@@ ated heat , even for his restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan on the other hand spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report all five times .
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but will even improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan had beha@@ ved like this would never happen . &quot;
it seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin &apos;s radiant , sustainable cows showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words : the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border of Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was kind@@ led .
Putin divided and accused Ankara to fall back in Russia .
leaving was even greater since it was done by a supposed friend .
building the ve@@ to again becomes difficult if not even impossible .
public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media launched a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
&quot; at once , it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything . &quot;
&quot; the most serious were the accus@@ ations of senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has v@@ ehem@@ ently denied this .
but in St.@@ Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward .
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin received the ap@@ ology from President Erdo@@ gan , which he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a ce@@ ase@@ fire are obvious . &quot;
&quot; in the first instance , Erdo@@ gan needs all the friends he can get after he has been reli@@ eved of almost his ministry last month with a failed coup d &quot; é@@ tat . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken him .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights , which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when the flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ č@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry to the West , as it looked at its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the continued gru@@ dge on the sn@@ ail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West . &quot;
&quot; in Ankara , the Russian head of state secured a claim that after the attempted coup d &quot; é@@ tat he requested support for the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , a matter of course that itself has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this brilliant palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; to Russia and Turkey : two countries that are viol@@ ating the West and feeling ill treated , and now f@@ ading . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , despite the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow recently played the role as a peac@@ em@@ aker , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents met at the press conference that they had not even stri@@ pped the issue . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphasize this . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster , when NATO member Turkey sho@@ wer@@ ed the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders speak at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland for customers outside Scotland no longer available
&quot; according to the Board of Management of the Bank , the R@@ BS brand should only be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told the BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the Bank has dist@@ anced itself since it had to be almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end consumer brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds of sponsor@@ ing , from Six Nations ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don vic@@ tor Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to focus on more national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to clients in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales , all RS@@ B references , the headquarters and the stock exchange listing at Nat@@ West will change . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster Bank brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other , smaller brands for private customers that are gaining more importance - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour of customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he shared the BBC Scotland with : &quot; the brand RS@@ B becomes our Invest@@ ors &quot; brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we now become more of a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; as the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I now say that we are not pursuing global goals , but local goals . &quot;
each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already said that its Six Nations sponsorship is no longer able to continue and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the various brands in its sport sponsorship .
&quot; it is time for us to develop into the bank of brands , because how do we focus on the inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; &quot; said the manager of the board . &quot;
it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago if we said we would be a great bank for our customers and that we would have launched these brands .
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , one will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these stamps again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
&quot; on Pre@@ dile@@ ction Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reached its 3,@@ 000@@ th profit at New@@ market &quot;
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , which brings him 3,@@ 000@@ th prize &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British prize at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ en , on his local race track with his second win of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , who reaches the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Richter , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori who before won at G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market because I landed here 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he wins the victory on Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and the retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who achieved more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record @-@ breaking career . &quot;
&quot; ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ys@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career opportunities &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of modern times and it is no surprise that he reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect that differs from the other in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for races , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma enthusi@@ astically enjoyed this sport for many years . &quot;
&quot; I told Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som that he had already gotten 6,000 winn@@ ings if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
&quot; in the UK , Frank@@ ie has already ri@@ dden almost 30 years of the winners , which is great . &quot;
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but beyond that he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Seven &quot; in As@@ cot in 1996 , but he also survived a plane crash and got a prohibition of drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six @-@ month lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his two @-@ fl@@ yers and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not at the end for a long time - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to his minimum of 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
&quot; Russian President Sergei Ivan@@ ov , Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov &quot;
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his chief of staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of Putin &apos;s nar@@ row@@ est confidence .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transportation Affairs .
&quot; in a statement by the Krem@@ lin , it reads that Putin has ordered the release of Ivan@@ ov@@ s from his duties as chairman of the Russian president . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who since 2012 was Ivan@@ ov@@ s deputy , was appointed to his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the website of the Krem@@ lin , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became the chief executive and Chief of Staff of the Regi@@ stra@@ r . &quot;
&quot; over his appointment , he said to Putin : &quot; thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot;
I think it is the government &apos;s most important task to support your work as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked for leaving his post and V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
do the smiling faces convince ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov , for a long time , was one of the nar@@ row@@ est trusted Vladimir Putin &apos;s and works as he was for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin , which was broad@@ cast@@ ed on television , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will res@@ ign on their own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the ridi@@ cu@@ le for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man , once praised as a potential president , suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy - came across great scep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , who are quoted on the Krem@@ lin website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It &apos;s true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 , I could almost say - entr@@ ust this post for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V accepted the post in December 2011 .
previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence .
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed to his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people he trusted in most . &quot;
&quot; once it was assumed that Ivan@@ ov could become President of Russia after Putin &apos;s second term , as a third term Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;

Putin became Prime Minister before he became president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved last month in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their termination in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the special agent Aaron Hotel , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his termination . &quot;
on the set there came to artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details on how the Gib@@ son character from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be published at a later date , according to the opinion of ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in the Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , was with him since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and have put my whole blood in the last twelve years , &quot; Gib@@ son said in a release published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but it will no longer be possible . &quot;
&quot; I would like to thank the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series . &quot;
the planned radi@@ ance of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ dd@@ les for fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
a resident of Ban@@ ff demanded help in identifying the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks that the 75 fish could deal with sandals that have been sp@@ un off by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , released a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge now connected with Fi@@ fe
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project to be completed by May 2017
engineers have connected the North deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings to the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ kt - meaning that the bridge is now connected with Fi@@ fe .
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; deck b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes .
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete as well as 46 hel@@ ical ropes . &quot;
the £ 1.@@ 35 billion project will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown put a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when constructing the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , the completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; all in all , almost 79 % of the bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tor said : &quot; the first lock represents a significant milestone in every bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the closure is a trend@@ setting high @-@ rise and civil engineering . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tur@@ mo@@ deck located in the extension , we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side . &quot;
this was achieved by dra@@ gging the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and simultaneously very delicate activity .
&quot; massive because the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 metres long , weighs about 6.000 tons and had to be pulled up at a incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; because the toler@@ ances that the team works , the toler@@ ances were tiny - on each side they were just a few milli@@ meters . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , everything went very well . &quot;
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; luck to be alive &quot;
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck to be alive &quot; &quot; after being thrown off by their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station struck Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
&quot; the three men had difficulty swimming in safety , while their boat moved on their own . &quot;
&quot; we saw the boat around him and presented us the worst thing , &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , the strong winds have already fle@@ eing the boat out of their reach until we left it , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were saved by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and found hanging on a Bo@@ je without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they were all aboard the coast rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station
&quot; Mr Jones said : &quot; &quot; the three men thrown into the water have been lucky and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had an emergency stop , but it loos@@ ened the boat from the person who controls the boat . &quot;
&quot; today , someone has watched over these men . &quot;
seriously injured - man li@@ stens to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man has attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife and seriously injured .
&quot; as the police said yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old had the key to the apartment to pick up his personal things . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcohol @-@ driven perpetr@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came to the apartment , he came twice on her . &quot;
the 44 @-@ year @-@ old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police were able to arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
they then al@@ armed their sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
therefore she went out of the house with her companions .
&quot; on the street , they met the man &apos;s ex @-@ wife . &quot;
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old pushed his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds favorable apartments in Braunschweig ?
&quot; in future , the SPD and the Green Party said , &quot; &quot; Invest@@ ors are expected to be much stronger in the future . &quot;
how do you react to the bad news that Br@@ uns@@ wick will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years ?
&quot; at the next council meeting , the SPD proposes a &quot; &quot; housing concept living &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost it is about the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing so far .
&quot; s &amp; D Group president Christoph Brat@@ mann believes : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : who wants to build on urban areas must in future have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built in stock . &quot;
&quot; however , the main point in the town hall is , &quot; said Brat@@ mann : &quot; how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent in such areas , but to build as much as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing construction programme , which will cost millions and still needs to be financed , shall provide incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , says Brat@@ mann : &quot; &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot;
the CD@@ U would like to make investors as few as possible .
the left wants even tough@@ er conditions for investors .
&quot; despite this , as Brat@@ mann , there is an intensi@@ fication of the situation on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the concept of action is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is needed .
it is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; however , the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which were to be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you balance the loss of another 1,@@ 300 affordable housing , which will exp@@ ire in the coming years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , the budget@@ ary spokes@@ woman Nicole Palm should now be bu@@ si@@ ly purchased from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be thought of getting apartments back into the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; for in the western city , the end of the year is running out . &quot;
around 1800 apartments could be picked up there back into the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing companies . &quot;
&quot; because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically , one removes itself from the goal of so @-@ called mixing . &quot;
there should no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens expect that there will be movement in the discussion .
&quot; said Group president Holger Her@@ lit@@ ch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; for a broad majority the CD@@ U has to go to the boat . &quot;
this has focused on more building sites for single @-@ family homes .
but what does not mean that there is still a compromise to be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness , worth it &quot;
it is fascinating to watch the world changes .
&quot; teenagers and children can no longer go outside to play , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time star@@ ing on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many over the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and finally on smartphones . &quot;
therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other .
&quot; of course I refer to the Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s ( later a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs were created ) . &quot;
&quot; like many pop culture phenomena , the interest in the publication of the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July . &quot;
market launch in other countries was postpon@@ ed by massive demand that over@@ loaded the servers .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ é@@ mon that are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they have been found , &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the j@@ ahn and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , followed by 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently reported that within two days after the game was launched , the number of subsequent people who exercise 30 minutes each day , jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns to health that people want to &quot; take 30 minutes time &quot; to &quot; come from the sofa &quot; and &quot; to be active every day , &quot; because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look el@@ end . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ rated . &quot;
&quot; who regularly drives sports , reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the wonder at Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it will bring people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - motion , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even make new friend@@ ships on the hunt .
&quot; as always , there are also gru@@ mp@@ y toys that have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could run against a door . &quot;
what should I do ?
a breakthrough happened .
&quot; even if Smartphone @-@ Apps like Fit@@ bit could track our activity earlier , they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time .
&quot; however , due to Pok@@ em@@ ons &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the asset in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , f@@ itter and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ age
forget the pressure .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all that .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ lessly on the beam .
breath@@ tak@@ ingly on the ground .
bril@@ li@@ antly brilliant .
and now also Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ brü@@ ten on Thursday for the multi@@ purpose title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world in front of all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their total score of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver medal winner and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es tur@@ net@@ ts on the suspended beam during the individual multi @-@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ as@@ tics at the Rio de Janeiro 2016 Olympic Summer Games , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American , who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and is the fifth , while she soli@@ di@@ fies her call to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment came to an end .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es has dominated the last three years , 15 world champi@@ ons - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lo@@ u Res@@ cue from her said that she is &quot; the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she was expecting a final examination in Brazil , a competition that didn &apos;t go so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas , would be considered a disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the Americans Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after they have won gold and silver in the individual multi @-@ campaign women in the art gymn@@ ast at the Olympic Summer Games 2016 in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday as she served as an ex@@ clamation mark on the farewell party of the co @-@ ordin@@ ator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i .
&quot; although it insi@@ sted that during its long path to the top , never to have planned the future , it is not really true . &quot;
part of their floor exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is no coincidence .
&quot; this girl , adopted by her grand@@ parents as a little child and discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um where Bo@@ or@@ man was trained , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , she has lost no more competition , a winning series that will last for as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ ina was slightly til@@ ted by two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive . &quot;
suspended beams and floor plans - in which Bil@@ es holds the world title title - lau@@ erten .
she recovered again with 15.@@ 4@@ 33 on the suspended beam - and sat on the ground with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her sof@@ tly as she expected her En@@ der@@ g@@ b@@ nis - pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed into bil@@ es bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her collection book became a reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance of Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ ina in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old clu@@ b@@ team captain , who is called &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her soil practice , she threw kis@@ ses to the public , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly expanding T@@ we@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a very new meaning at the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims in a mur@@ der@@ ous case when listening to music in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , who have died in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first series mur@@ der@@ ous attack by Phoenix , while they stopped in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand @-@ fire weapon while standing on the passenger side of the car and then fled with another vehicle to read in the report .
&quot; the police said that the triple murder does not seem to have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , since the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 , owned by one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that sho@@ ot@@ ings led investig@@ ators to take a closer look at whether they are connected to four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in His@@ panic residential neighbor@@ hoods within four months and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several cars , including a brown N@@ iss@@ ans from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that led them to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized because of its injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis &apos;s daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which was abor@@ ted on an empty pick@@ up truck , half an hour before the thre@@ ef@@ old murder and assumed that it was the serial killer &apos;s work . &quot;
investig@@ ators found cartridge sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ ia : &quot; it gets better &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but as the least of his contem@@ por@@ aries , Ed@@ mund micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that . &quot;
I don &apos;t create that .
I didn &apos;t let go of that .
&quot; what is wrong at all -- of course , one has left it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; her husband Vincent and her are told that Ed@@ mund will never be able to recognize her , and that he may not even survive . &quot;
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise him .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do , &apos; explained Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to . &quot;
Ed@@ mund can walk with the help of a walking aid .
Ed@@ mund was not able to sit or craw@@ l up to his third year of life and he still can &apos;t speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign language that Ed@@ mund designed for &quot; Please sing me something before . &quot;
&quot; we bring him drawing language , &quot; said Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- it says . Ed@@ mund found some signs alone .
&quot; micro@@ cephal@@ ia has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund , as well as infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy . &quot;
symptoms and progn@@ oses can vary greatly .
it is still too early to say how it will affect the life of those infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; I constantly asked , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; I have not asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I didn &apos;t expect it to really tell me anyone . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of babies with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it gets better .
you know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ alls and large floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency booth on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the South of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi River floo@@ ding their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , reported the National Weather Service . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards informed that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on the way to the communities involved .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the governor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand bags increased . &quot;
&quot; Ste@@ ele said that alone , the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags . &quot;
a flood warning system is used over wide parts in the south of Lou@@ isi@@ ana until Saturday .
the weather service allowed an additional 3 to 5 inch of rain in this area .
&quot; in southern Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood early warning system was deployed on Friday as it was still ra@@ ining in the area of Mobile . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the river Am@@ ite near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will all probability reach record levels . &quot;
the met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flood many houses in the nearby Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a downstream flood in Ascension par@@ ish is a danger , as these flows through the beaten rivers only slowly in the Lake Mo@@ rep@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ v , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi State border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;
rescue teams still kno@@ cked people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the Sou@@ thwest of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those who were saved on Friday near Glo@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally more than 400 feet away from his house , asc@@ ended greatly over night . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives near him would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and ushed in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife told Hans@@ ford that in the 48 years in which she lived there , she had never seen such a high level of the river . &quot;
Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the han@@ di@@ caps and he would be the only one who can swim .
Hans@@ ford said that emergency aid rescu@@ ers had saved all three in a large military truck and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster where they stayed until Friday .
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood occurred &quot; rapidly spreading , &quot; as there were still severe rainf@@ alls and that the authorities considered evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer reported in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inch rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the soil was significantly absorbed by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ alls and street floo@@ ding caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and classes in five bor@@ ou@@ ghs .
C@@ BS subsidiary WW@@ L reported that an or@@ derly in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa attacked 200 buildings .
&quot; the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated into two churches , which were now both flooded . &quot;
&quot; the leader of the Rob@@ by Miller congregation said that the authorities saved 72 people and seven pets , which were r@@ ins@@ ed from the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were set up to accommodate the evacu@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the water begins to go back , they will be able to return to their homes , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the town of Ham@@ mond of the municipality of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags provided for the residents to take part , hoping to keep the water from their homes and shops . &quot;
&quot; the last big flood we had was in March , &quot; L@@ acy Land@@ rum said about the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the Emer@@ gency Manager Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it was still ra@@ ining on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his data , a handful of houses on Thursday were reported to be flooded , but on Friday they were not reported . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , manager at shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has lived in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places I have never seen before , &quot; &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; um@@ ig@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
&quot; the police say that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia , this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child is shot . &quot;
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him for C@@ BS Philadelphia as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown .
&quot; grand@@ parents stated that Brown suffered several shot injuries , including in the L@@ ende , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital at his transport to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his little body was f@@ um@@ ig@@ ated by bul@@ lets , &quot; he shared his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the transmitter . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it .
the boy &apos;s condition was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy &apos;s family told the station that he is expected to recover again .
he would have to start the first class at a local elementary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found at the front seat of a car along with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old , who is in a critical condition , shot up , reports the transmitter . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police just as@@ cer@@ tained whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ators .
investig@@ ators shared C@@ BS Philadelphia that it seems to have come to a bon@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers .
&quot; cartridge shells for assault rif@@ les , which were traced to various assault rif@@ les , over@@ se@@ wed the crime scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the road , on both sides of the side@@ walk , were seals . &quot;
&quot; so it seems to have given several armed fighters who were very active , &quot; said police officer Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the transmitter . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles hit in the area .
there was no arrest and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video .
&quot; on Tuesday another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by an ag@@ grav@@ ator on the arm , when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she gets up and the police is still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine under the women &apos;s olymp@@ i@@ onship in the Tur@@ nen and that of more than one reason .
&quot; first of all , I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; and secondly : this team has three tur@@ rets , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , who inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew is and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , the Catho@@ licon , rounds off , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and His@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female Tur@@ ner@@ innen was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championships in Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they delivered unexpected but master@@ ly gy@@ mass rout@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event for women . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but do not look like gymn@@ astic classes throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it the Olympic team . &quot;
&quot; they are the &quot; &quot; Last Five &quot; &quot; because the next Olympic stadium will only have four gymn@@ asts in the team . furthermore , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality is that Tur@@ ns is an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner is primarily involved in private sports clubs , which are maintained by parents who are responsible for training , orientation , travel , competition and hotel costs ( for trainers and their gymn@@ asts and families ) . &quot;
the majority of these trainers are in prosper@@ ous suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the gymn@@ asts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , trainer of Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , both exercised their athletes since they started gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we need to be inspired by the communities of au@@ n number@@ ous young girls who are inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , providing a more affordable and accessible exercise training . &quot;
I founded my Turn@@ Key for 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable tourism in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer youth high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determin@@ at@@ eness for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success .
&quot; it is the inspiration of this team , which bring thousands of young girls to interest in the gymn@@ as@@ tics and that &apos;s great . &quot;
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by bringing the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant doctors want to organize further strikes after rej@@ ecting Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 resident doctors , who voted for a vote , rejected him . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the contract , and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; &quot; Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land &quot; &quot; and that any further delay would be detri@@ mental to the employees and patients . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance doctors shall receive a new contract , which contains changes to night and weekend bites , in order to improve the maintenance at an ast@@ ounding clock time . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the chairman of the BM@@ A committee for assistance doctors said last night in a message : &quot; assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and ad@@ mon@@ ish it to handle all doctors . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress has to be made and time runs out . &quot;
&quot; efforts by the BM@@ A to resolve disputes through discussions met with the government on reluct@@ ance to participate , and at times de@@ af@@ ening silence . &quot;
this was the case of a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made only last month that his door would always be open .
Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now to lift up the constra@@ int and address the concerns of the assistance doctors .
&quot; if he should not do this , the assistance doctors have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work campaigns . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strip chain . &quot;
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting the re@@ formed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A wants a better weekly wage for the 5@@ 4,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , Director General of the N@@ HS staff , asked the assistance doctors to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; work combat measures do not achieve little harm , but already pol@@ lu@@ te over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients , care@@ gi@@ vers and their families only sor@@ rows , distress and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the committee of the assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as sending , flexibility in training , additional training for those who return from a professional time , scho@@ oling , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
the £ 2 @-@ per day drug that can reduce heart attack risk
thousands of heart attack patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per day drug having been recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the coag@@ ul@@ ant medication Tic@@ in@@ rel@@ or reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medicine is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , thereby reducing the risk of stroke or heart attack . &quot;
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year dose intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ ICE regulatory authority has recommended a four @-@ year dose intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; approximately 140@@ ,000 people suffer a heart attack every year and one quarter of it suffers from another heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls , forming the plaque . &quot;
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood c@@ lot causing the blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots trigger , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
people who already had a heart attack are subject to a higher risk of having another .
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots more likely . &quot;
&quot; the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today , recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , Director of N@@ ICE Health Technology Assessment Center , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on a person &apos;s quality of life .
the experience shows that Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or is in combination with aspir@@ in effectively in reducing further heart attacks and strokes in people who have already had a heart attack .
&quot; due to a provisional recommendation from Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to expand available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness Blo@@ oming electoral fraud in Muslim areas
the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man was removed last year on the dis@@ mis@@ sal of a government report due to corruption from office
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a cr@@ ushing government report today revealed .
&quot; the former member of the cabinet , Sir Eric Pick@@ les , verb@@ ally attacks the police , election monitors and town halls to ignore the evidence of mis@@ use due to &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ no and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government , who is now an answer to corruption , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of vot@@ ees from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut @-@ off tapes outside of electoral cabins to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should have a certificate with them , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er only needs to call his name and address . &quot;
the report proposes to apply non removable ink on the finger of a person when they release their votes to prevent someone choosing twice .
whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should get more protection says Sir Eric .
he demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of non @-@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only for election fraud , but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial bet@@ ru@@ ction culture associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ lets election scale in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a special court decided that the acting mayor Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man after a lit@@ any was to be reli@@ eved of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
the court found that Rah@@ man had per@@ ver@@ ted the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; in cy@@ ni@@ cal way &quot; and that he would have sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia .
Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the rel@@ ig@@ matic duty of Muslims to choose him .
up to 300 voices were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which one person chooses someone else .
Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he expressed al@@ arm@@ ingly to the frau@@ dul@@ ent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including the leaders of clu@@ es to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; it is stated in his report : &quot; &quot; as proof that pressure is exer@@ ted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities , especially women and young people , in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pak@@ ist@@ ani or Lebanese background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... State institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such a behavior due to &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean up the system , including the ban that political activists edit mail@@ shot documents in order to stop &quot; &quot; voting &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social purposes . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
carry out systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limitation to applications for an automatic postal code .
ban that political activists edit full post @-@ elections and envel@@ opes of letters .
the police force the authority to set up shut @-@ off stations .
a change of law that facilitates an indictment for in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the Repres@@ entation of the People Act 1983 ( Legisl@@ ative Act 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing prohibited in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( with the exception of Wales ) .
intensi@@ fication of the training to ensure that staff generally enforce that voters go on their own in the cho@@ ise cabin alone .
Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s case no criminal complaint was placed .
&quot; the Constitutional Court has declared Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man and his deputy to be un@@ suitable because of a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he was found guilty of a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings .
he also critic@@ ises the effective &quot; check checks &quot; of the election registr@@ ations of the town halls .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of the parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
&quot; this week , fans of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio will be amazed by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T , who has proven to be an impressive double @-@ singer of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge . &quot;
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympi@@ oni@@ kin is by far not the only one to have gold fighting ath@@ lete , who has its own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not if you are allowed to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces fli@@ cker on our screens , F@@ email has created a list of Olympic Games that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity with Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; the hunter and the wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio since his childhood . &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the race track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio could be . &quot;
&quot; team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures , on which he sees the wolf of Wall Street Star un@@ cann@@ ily similar . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I see no big simil@@ arity with the exception of the facial hair , &quot; said Bra@@ dy of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good looking guy , so I &apos;ll take it as compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focus of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ jum@@ per Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina with her big expressive eyes is supposed to be a double @-@ singer for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
&quot; and in the pool , the South African s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one step higher : this user is the opinion that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor
&quot; another ongoing comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver medal race in Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like the act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan Adrian was att@@ ested to fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : football star Hope solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face shape and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others liked the similarities
&quot; theory placed in the room : according to this user , there may be a reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple . &quot;
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US football star Hope Solo and the D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an unbeliev@@ ably similar face @-@ face and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney as well as the gold medal winner in the Tur@@ nen Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;
C@@ BC comment@@ ator for the Olympic Games ap@@ ologi@@ zes for his statement that Chinese s@@ wimm@@ ers died like a pig
By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds analysis on the fourth place of the 14 @-@ year old Ai Yan@@ han at d@@ r 4x@@ 100m free @-@ sty@@ led audience of the C@@ BC live transmission of the Ol@@ m@@ yp@@ ical games on Wednesday
&quot; Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese swi@@ mmer &quot; &quot; went down like M@@ ief &quot; &quot; and died during the race as &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 100m free @-@ sty@@ led squ@@ ad@@ ron .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald who was brought aboard the C@@ BS comment@@ ator team to give more &quot; colour &quot; could be heard : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , went down like M@@ ief , died like a pig . &quot;
thank you for that .
&quot; the Chinese float Ai Yan@@ han , 14 , sw@@ am the second stage of the swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron 1 : 5@@ 7.@@ 79 - 1.@@ 61 seconds slower than Canada &apos;s Taylor Ru@@ ck , which enabled the Canadian to close the gap to China . &quot;
viewers across Canada responded quickly online after they were shocked by the sound and language
&quot; Emm@@ ett Mac@@ far@@ away twe@@ ets , &quot; &quot; Di@@ d the C@@ BC comment@@ ator just said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old s@@ wimm@@ ers from China &quot; &quot; like a pig died &quot; &quot; ? ? ? ? &quot;
the idi@@ ot has not broken that they were still on stream .
&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described as follows at the fin@@ als 4 x 200m high @-@ style swimming squ@@ ad@@ ron for women : &quot; &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the criticism of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter came quickly and hard with which many were talking about him
Twitter users didn &apos;t return when they heard how un@@ aware By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user in Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let us all look like ra@@ cists .
&quot; shortly afterwards , Scott Rus@@ el , who hosted the C@@ BC show , ap@@ ologi@@ zed live for the commentary of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the commentary was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , sorry that it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed for more than 90 times with the people who responded to the Not@@ ice on Twitter
the commentary colleague Scott Rus@@ el had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC copied and added his ap@@ ologies with more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ining about the comments of Mac@@ Donald
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and released a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was enabled to be broadcast .
yesterday night we ap@@ ologi@@ zed to our audience on show and our followers in the social media .
&quot; in order to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron is sorry for what he said . &quot;
on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald was ap@@ olog@@ ising in the show and tried to justify his remark by saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack .
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the women &apos;s cre@@ ws in the C@@ BC Olympic show , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have referred to the performance of s@@ wimm@@ ers , and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no dis@@ regard was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark ou@@ tra@@ ged by woman who sham@@ elessly under@@ wear ling@@ erie in the middle of the business
&quot; the buyers did not know where to go , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a pri@@ mar@@ row to try out under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to make the situation worse , she looked as she looked at it , pulled her out and put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; they rum@@ bled on and tried four pairs of signatures in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , Germany . &quot;
&quot; the primary store at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Centre in Folk@@ estone , where the woman tried the under@@ pants , before she put them back into the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who had been in business at the same time , said that after the mysterious woman had tried her under@@ wear , she went on and left the business without buying anything . &quot;
she said : &quot; people could not believe what they saw .
&quot; standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of under@@ pants from the out@@ lay , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and pants and tried them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when they pulled out the under@@ pants , which you obviously didn &apos;t like , as they put them back into the shelf . &quot;
&quot; she repeated the same thing with three more under@@ pants , before she finally decided that she didn &apos;t like to dress again and went out . &quot;
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone watching - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the under@@ pants that she had tried .
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent , said : &quot; &quot; how to think reluct@@ antly that someone would take shelter with someone who had a different person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Mrs. Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I received , the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - what &apos;s just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new couple of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had touched her and pulled out and she didn &apos;t get washed .
&quot; a speaker of Pri@@ mark said : &quot; &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident which took place on Tuesday August 9 at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products in question have been withdrawn from sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
&quot; the world outside is a dangerous place , but this video by Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you . &quot;
&quot; we spoke to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind , this video will show you how to turn the sk@@ ewer for your rob@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; if you are approached from behind , you should turn around as first , so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the cast line , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
&quot; then hit him with his knee in the bar and twist , while the attack@@ er cur@@ ls before pain , the weapon out of his hands . hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while doing the weapon on him . &quot;
&quot; with attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the cast line , grab the weapon and twist it so that the attack@@ er can &apos;t shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time shift the weight to the weapon and beat the Att@@ acker on the chest , then twist the weapon out of its grip , before moving backwards and set the weapon on it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly how it makes Miz@@ ra@@ chi .
&quot; however , remember that a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est way to pass your money - provided you are not a Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Grand Master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ uts his tongue to the dir@@ ti@@ est places in Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and di@@ gni@@ fied case of a serious test - putting off some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k sh@@ ook his course on a euro note , a hand@@ rail at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a rin@@ se button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before removing each object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show himself and us what he is going to do . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results to light . &quot;
&quot; the thought to remove the rin@@ se button of a draw shower that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing left what he li@@ cked , more than a bad taste in the mouth . &quot;
&quot; W@@ right became known to test the resistance of his intest@@ ines , traveling through the world and eating odd things as well as wonderful things . &quot;
&quot; from public funds to railway stations to sin@@ ks of toilets , the task of the immune system definitely put under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively un@@ concerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and slu@@ dge water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was justified in any case . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
its sample line showed a lumin@@ ometer number of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the L@@ umin@@ ometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian rest@@ room that he refused to lick , after their L@@ umin@@ ometer number was over 4000 units , while fresh washed hands have less than 60 units . &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; indicating the number of bacteria in different places , such as the bathroom . &quot;
&quot; in the film he says : &quot; &quot; that comes close to the worst thing I have ger@@ o@@ cked in a toilet . &quot;
there is nothing more mut@@ ated than that !
I won &apos;t dock here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains both lac@@ tic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; Vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended with saying &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I instructed him to lick , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet that is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult . &quot;
I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o in 2015 , 84 percent of all respon@@ dents reported lac@@ tic acid bacteria in particular with the well @-@ being of stomach and intest@@ ines and 58 percent said they use at least occasional products containing lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ zi@@ ale family destroyed before Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung social apartment in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ zi@@ al family left their social apartment after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung with a loss of £ 50,000 , because it had terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , the property owner shocked the property in an irre@@ parable condition . &quot;
&quot; the walls showed pla@@ in@@ ly holes , wooden plan@@ ks were torn , rub@@ b@@ ish was scattered on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was lubri@@ cated to the walls . &quot;
the family has been res@@ ett@@ led and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for the house management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for the people here and I think people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider since this estate is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and their reputation is also known .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had joined , street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive scre@@ aming , quar@@ rels and flu@@ xes included . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ by , 47 , whose name was on the lease , got an arrangement for anti @-@ social behaviour in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found &quot;
&quot; in the estate , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden floor@@ boards were torn up &quot;
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing gi@@ fted her and her partner this week forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbors who said that their life was made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; They didn &apos;t care about anyone . &quot;
we lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad .
the countless times we say the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be nice . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager from Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said that the family had agreed to cooperate with the local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house , to which the police was called at regular intervals , for 20 years . &quot;
on the over@@ grown side of the community house tr@@ ash and old toys were thrown down
&quot; he added : &quot; it is a shame that the les@@ see agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family , as del@@ o@@ gi@@ zation is always the final step that Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing is taking into consideration . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions needed to be horrible for their neighbours .
&quot; I appreciate all the work that my team , the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message communic@@ ates that anti @-@ social behaviour is not tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;
a dirty mattress covered in one of the bedrooms of the house after del@@ o@@ gi@@ zing on the ground
house@@ keeping workers will now have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house
&quot; in 2014 , the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as balances , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ alia and cash in the amount of £ 1.@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ by received a fine of money after being guilty of own@@ ing a drug of class B in commercial custody .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in a car accident in 2013 .
&quot; after having been homeless , it is assumed that T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many walls of the house were gra@@ ff@@ iti with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will del@@ o@@ ge tenants who do not stick to the house rules
Angela C@@ row was told by the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall that the Del@@ o@@ gi@@ erung is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not abide by the house rules .
&quot; this goes to those who think that they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ aches , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such behavior , &quot; she said . &quot;
the police of De@@ von and Corn@@ wall will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
&quot; tourists to Portugal in panic , after a ti@@ eff@@ able military jet over@@ flies the beach &quot;
&quot; sun worshi@@ ppers in Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a portu@@ g@@ isi@@ es@@ che P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on Air@@ plane of the Air Force placed an incredible storm flight
&quot; air strikes indicating that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no safety risk . &quot;
this was the moment when frigh@@ tened tourists start to panic after a ti@@ eff@@ able jet slow@@ ed over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how the military aircraft flew close to the beach in Av@@ eiro in northern Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they understand@@ ably started to worry about the noise of the key plants , without first seeing what was passing through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many vac@@ ation@@ ers who posted videos about the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media , said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep two times and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane fell down on me . &quot;
tourists at the beach of Av@@ eiro were in panic when the plane came out of the darkness and flew incredibly deep .
&quot; the Portuguese Air Force today announced that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight , to identify fishing boats off the coast and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to identify them . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man said that the jet flew lower than usual due to poor visibility , but the air forces insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk . &quot;
&quot; area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer , in which there were also four people on the island Madeira to death . &quot;
&quot; the Portuguese air forces today announced that the pilot had to fly so deeply due to the circumstances - strong fog and smoke smoke , which restric@@ ts his view &quot;
the airplane was on a training flight where the pilot fishing boats had to identify as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries against Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - FC Barcelona is fighting for the first step in the new football season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup to the FC Sevilla , the back@@ lash will rise three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ man must refrain from competing with the defeated Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing Europa League champion , among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who den@@ ies the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot;
also Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter St@@ egen is missing .
&quot; in the course of the training , the German suffered a change in the knee , which clari@@ fies the interro@@ gation of Bar@@ ca at least for the time being in favor of Claudio Bra@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; for two years , the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen compete for the status as number one . &quot;
&quot; coach Luis En@@ rique had so far refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most other races cont@@ ested . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory play of the new season , there is doubt about the fitness condition of the team , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test game from Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
also at 3 : 2 at Pro@@ beg@@ al@@ op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. didn &apos;t really convince yet .
&quot; Sevilla , again , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the &quot; &quot; Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with so far eleven successes , Barcelona is the record winner in this competition . &quot;
Ma Long in a separate league to table tennis
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis Olympic champion .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12.@@ 5.@@ 4,4 ) on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup first took the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with success at World Cup , World Cup , World Tour Fin@@ al@@ tur@@ nier and just Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ th@@ ani .
the two Chinese managed it as expected and made the title to each other .
&quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five R@@ ings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese on the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö @-@ Legi@@ on@@ aire Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone , between the sentences and at time @-@ outs , they had no cre@@ denti@@ als . &quot;
they had pulled back on the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ ectors in a fair competition on their own .
&quot; the Mat@@ ches to here I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang said . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China banner . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly one @-@ sided .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old opponent only in the first sentence .
&quot; after that , he determined the tempo on the record and left Z@@ hang as only a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; through the su@@ pre@@ m@@ acy of Ma , not the expected ro@@ using match developed . &quot;
&quot; however , nevertheless enough stunning ball changes were to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ zu@@ ani won the Bronze medal against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ow 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ fin@@ als against the German champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ rus@@ hing had a ri@@ b injury after that , after that in medical treatment , he had to &quot; &quot; end up &quot; &quot; with sheet metal . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) have been in similar high table tennis age Olympics @-@ Vi@@ erte . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits &quot; huge problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditionally conservative states . &quot;
the presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp now has weaknesses of his election campaign in the past republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
a rare moment in which the usually large @-@ lane and self @-@ confident mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary expressed something like concerns as correspon@@ dents reported .
&quot; after having thrown 16 ri@@ vals within his own republi@@ can camp , doubts continue to grow in the fight for the White House . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp , in front of evangel@@ ical Christians who asked for support in important states such as Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; wrong reports about his can@@ did@@ acy were guilt , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media shi@@ py@@ ard . &quot;
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ ed
U@@ tah is usually a safe bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey by Sur@@ vey@@ ard from June , Tru@@ mp and his bankrupt@@ cy from demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton , were alike . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in front , but not by the distance that can be common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview by the radio station CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp answered the question of how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I have done so far . &quot;
&quot; and if afterwards : this will either be successful , or I will make a very nice , long vacation . &quot;
&quot; he is doing nothing else , as &quot; telling the truth . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if it does not reach him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of life .
&quot; according to press reports , the party of Tru@@ mp should have threatened to strike money to support its campaign , it should not be able to present better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the Repub@@ lic@@ ans &quot; candidates for Congress would be stronger among the poor . &quot;
Olympic : three sc@@ am at dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to establish a disciplinary committee in the event .
&quot; after the second dop@@ ing affair , Kenya &apos;s athletes are threatened with the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic Village , Kenya has sent a trainer to home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee announced to immediately establish a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary had told the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , in the Olympic Village a Ur@@ in sample under the name of the 800 @-@ metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich . &quot;
this has been reported to the team leader Ken@@ y@@ as by the dop@@ ing controllers .
&quot; the IA@@ AF world association asked the IO@@ C for information about the case to ex@@ ert their own investigations , informed a IA@@ AF spokes@@ man . &quot;
&quot; depending on the results of the study and the subsequent IO@@ C actions , the IA@@ AF will evaluate an evaluation , &quot; said it in an IA@@ AF statement . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the dop@@ ing control station and presented himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich , released and signed the rehear@@ sal , &quot; declared Kenya &apos;s chief de mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete who was on the list for the training controls of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ ich was in Beijing World Cup fourth more than 800 meters in 2015 .
&quot; four days earlier , the Ken@@ yan athle@@ tics delegation , Michael Rot@@ ich , had been withdrawn from the Rio Games . &quot;
he is said to have informed athletes of his country about pending dop@@ ing tests .
&quot; according to media reports , he was allegedly arrested at his return at the airport of Nairobi . &quot;
Kenya has been under special observation at the IO@@ C after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences for a long time .
&quot; in the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls presented by IO@@ C in front of the Rio Games , it was previously noted that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
&quot; the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency had exer@@ ted much pressure on the African country in Brazil , an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system . &quot;
the law was passed a few weeks before the Olympics .
&quot; in consequence , WA@@ DA Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control conform to the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is regarded as a big runner @-@ nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports of ARD , accus@@ ations were repeatedly raised that dop@@ ing funds are easily accessible in Kenya and there is a considerable mentality of sports fraud . &quot;
&quot; IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und recently called for a similar examination in Kenya , as he had indicated in Russian athle@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , it could be proven that in this sport area was surface @-@ covering and systematically absorbed . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Russia &apos;s athletes were excluded from the summer games . &quot;
&quot; Salzburg &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot;
&quot; during the Shakespeare Year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a portable love couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with it a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bern@@ steins &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth mare . &quot;
&quot; in the orchestra , the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchester under the leadership of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients in their tempo and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mixture , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have Bern@@ steins &apos;s music in our blood !
&quot; in this production , Bart@@ oli plays an older Maria . &quot;
&quot; she recalls with melanch@@ oly about her boy@@ friend Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it is musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot; &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course also na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; she resembles me very much , my Italian character I have as Rö@@ mer@@ in , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour for us to work with her .
it is an enormously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli returns the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an extraordinary artist and passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; you see it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge chance to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temp@@ er , a fire , a passion and a happy approach to life , that is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for the American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley is the &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , at that time the Pu@@ pp@@ ans went to New York and the New Yor@@ kers didn &apos;t want them . &quot;
&quot; they are the same topics , and they are as meaningful today as at that time . &quot;
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
London &apos;s school girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls who left London last year to join the IS , died in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago , her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air attack in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the group bul@@ war@@ k in the country , reported I@@ TV News on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had decided to leave the war @-@ torn country and to return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good thing is - as warning and warning to others that this is the risks associated with going into a war zone - to prevent people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other girls from the east of London entered a plane to Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and became a widow within a few months .
Rei@@ d says Clinton will remain as candidates for the Supreme Court in the case of an election victory in Gar@@ land
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the judge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since his nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the dec@@ eased judge in the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that he expected Clinton to choose Gar@@ land with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he had not talked to Clinton whether she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about rest@@ lessness with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the Supreme Court for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ al for the District of Columbia .
&quot; RAID said , Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands Nom@@ ination , are lack@@ eys and hel@@ pers of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
he also noted that Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the Pres@@ i@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants neck @-@ calendar for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats magazine co@@ operates with the photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired Calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the editor @-@ in @-@ chief of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his neck @-@ magazin of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boy distinguishes himself , since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the view that it does the Calendar also .
&quot; we have to return to the presentation of timeless and classic n@@ ak@@ edness in which both women and men feel well and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release to release the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a wonderful work of art .
models can submit their images online or in person at an open casting call in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community anticip@@ ates mass flight
&quot; whoever doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan , sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kur@@ d municipality of Germany comp@@ utes with tens of thousands of refugees fle@@ eing from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , it could even be &quot; some hundred thousand , &quot; believes the chairman of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; due to the harsh protest of Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan after the coup attempt , the Kur@@ d community Germany expects a mass flight to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium @-@ term with several hundred thousand polic@@ emen from Turkey in Germany , when the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; says the President of the Union Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; because the government had already over@@ grown Kurdish strongh@@ olds with imp@@ unity several months ago , 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey were fle@@ eing . &quot;
&quot; after put@@ sch , there were still secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they are further supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the chief of the association compla@@ ined about the targeted res@@ ett@@ lement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; with this , Erdo@@ gan hopes to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a CD@@ U member . &quot;
the chairman of the association called for the Federal Government to be &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , too , a &quot; witch hunt &quot; against Erdo@@ gan critics takes place . &quot;
I don &apos;t feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months .
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as a Gü@@ len @-@ follow@@ er destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; who doesn &apos;t fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan is sitting on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , Chairman of the Gü@@ len @-@ nearby Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as the newspaper reported on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum seekers recognized by political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , these were 11,@@ 3@@ 86 people and thus nearly 29 per cent of all recognised as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; this survey does not include those before war , poverty or lack of perspective . &quot;
&quot; asylum rights according to the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. from the state side , individually persecuted . &quot;
Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : &quot; go where it hur@@ ts &quot;
strange Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern : the locals won &apos;t get anything from the summer campaign - and the holiday@@ makers from North Rhine @-@ Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag .
in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; in 2021 , the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for stupid as yet it is not about : summer holidays , heat and day @-@ day competition - that bites . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced by the election fighters , are on vacation . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers who are in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see are not the locals , so they are not allowed to choose the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; there are practical problems : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , spread fl@@ yers and count votes in the end are only lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; as of September 4 , 2016 , the election and last holiday day , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern has to pass the election campaign just barely by the people over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , must be afraid of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now clearly behind the CD@@ U in surveys . &quot;
exciting is how strongly newcom@@ er Af@@ D cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous electoral campaign , one sees from his big posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels across the country , distri@@ butes roses and chat@@ ters a little with the people , just as his legendary singer Harald Ring@@ storff had already done . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , Seel@@ ering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blossom@@ ing of the Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; &quot; We create that &quot; &quot; acceler@@ ates the rise of the right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which is now likely to cost him the beautiful ministry . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its Spitzen@@ kan@@ di@@ daten , the Minister of the Interior Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when you make the right place for the wrong time at the right place . &quot;
she has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large @-@ scale explor@@ ations ; Merkel &apos;s parliamentary group is located in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , Secretary General of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
&quot; but it &apos;s a pity , no one from other corners of Germany , to listen to Angela Merkel once . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the north @-@ east CD@@ U largely wai@@ ves the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping centres with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; that , says Kok@@ ert , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has also noted that in the country , it is crum@@ bling the ground that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : there is hardly any present in the sides of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U election fighter Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; you must go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden Wed@@ dings , every birthday party must be used . &quot;
&quot; because there is much on the game , Sell@@ ering has called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign . &quot;
&quot; in surveys , the Socialists and Democrats la@@ gged behind partners CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just before the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election of 2011 , the SPD had still won with 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Gre@@ ens , a small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , are likely to make the leap into the Land@@ tag . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of summer poverty and largely reloc@@ ate their campaign to the internet .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; is the president of the country Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , green election fighters embar@@ k on search for native vocal ch@@ ests among the holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top @-@ candidate , cur@@ vy straight with a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful . &quot;
&quot; your impression : &quot; &quot; electoral holidays in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot; &quot; &quot;
B@@ 27 refurb@@ ishment : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which start at 5.@@ 30 in the morning and only end at about 8@@ pm , there is all praise . &quot;
&quot; they did everything pretty z@@ ack@@ y , &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a Super@@ team .
there is also no delay .
&quot; the construction site was scheduled to be reloc@@ ated to the south at the end of the week , by the end of October . &quot;
&quot; the design of those responsible for the construction work is also commen@@ ded , for example when it comes to the establishment of housing trips . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has been mig@@ rated to the south and the block@@ age of the Asp@@ erg@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the site is relaxed . &quot;
the citizens can now drive from O@@ fter@@ dingen out of the B 27 on both sides .
the departure from the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King , responsible for the management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ el@@ straße , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner@@ straße and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Sch@@ leich@@ wege were seeking and more familiar with their Nav@@ i than the sign@@ posting . &quot;
what led to a fran@@ chise of some trucks in residential areas .
&quot; since the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the community encouraged the measuring vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; says King , who made himself a spot on the spot . &quot;
two to three per minute have already been fired .
the fastest was on the way with 77 ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometres in the Tempo @-@ 30 @-@ Zone .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become qui@@ eter . &quot;
for the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is open again .
business@@ men don &apos;t like to look into the maps .
&quot; but the fact that the B 27 refurb@@ ishment has led to sales break@@ downs , everyone you ask will let you look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and some less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; end customer &quot; are produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the deal@@ ership in Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z speaks of a &quot; &quot; most slight drop &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that , of course , &quot; &quot; the running exploration is missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the bars along the road .
&quot; J. Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of the Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential threatening .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants have hit it &quot; hard . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we must be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; in terms of sales revenues , he goes to &quot; far more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot;
the road marking had its operation &quot; thrown back for two years . &quot;
he had to leave half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have re@@ acted differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from G@@ öh@@ ner if there could be a financial compensation , otherwise the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . now , they must also bear the disadvantages that arise from the renovation . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where such a generous deal has been handled .
&quot; in all suits , G@@ öh@@ ner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , family business has been here since 17@@ 15 , and refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you can &apos;t drive , it is also somewhere else . &quot;
&quot; however , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts about that his family @-@ clientele is coming back to the end of the renovation work . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and avi@@ an flu , G@@ öh@@ ner thinks the impact of the B 27 construction works on his clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its host in its long @-@ term history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , this is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of the fight against terror , it is constantly bol@@ ted to laws . &quot;
&quot; following the recent attacks , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a large security package . &quot;
but what has a Dul@@ se status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the reconc@@ iled .
&quot; all his proposals were &quot; &quot; politically reasonable &quot; &quot; to the coalition partner , &quot; &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they are demanding no one .
&quot; other , out@@ going points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in this .
&quot; however , as the Minister of Interior , he was well @-@ known to him and at a &quot; re@@ cover@@ able consensus &quot; within the coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , Mai@@ zi@@ ère has left a little time to conc@@ eal his conclusions for the security of the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; a lot is already known , announced , announced , that a new security authority should take care of the jaw@@ s of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and arms law .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising . &quot;
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère will start a second attempt for proposals that have not been made with the SPD : he wants to recru@@ it sympathy for terrorist groups and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with dual citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; these will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; &quot; ad@@ mits the CD@@ U man . &quot;
&quot; he still believes this to be reasonable and does not claim anything , which is not a chance for the coalition partner anyway . &quot;
a few new ideas will be presented de Mai@@ zi@@ ère as well .
they have partially in themselves : he is planning quick practices for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the incar@@ cer@@ ation of people from deportation .
refugees that are targeted specifically in the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a safety review .
&quot; in the case of toler@@ ations for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some even worse than until now - about such crimes that commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are political and legal .
some of them are still un@@ play@@ able and are open to questions .
&quot; and at some point - in the un@@ equal treatment of patients , for example , the question arises : what does this have to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be said that the assass@@ ins of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , in view of the high number of refugees , many people were worried about security . &quot;
&quot; and things that deeply occupied the people could not be cl@@ en@@ ched , even in election times . &quot;
the inner security has shifted enormously into the focus .
&quot; only the attacks in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Wu@@ erz@@ burg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are elections . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , there was a high level between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; it was only a hor@@ r@@ end@@ ous argument about the equipment of the Federal Police , then about a security @-@ policy @-@ collection of some Uni@@ ons Interior Minister , in which the departments also call for a bur@@ ka ban and a return from the dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also te@@ dious for conci@@ li@@ atory tones .
he doesn &apos;t stop from a withdrawal from the double @-@ pass .
we have ended the discussion in Germany .
to re@@ open it is not sensible .
&quot; and with a Bur@@ ka prohibition , he has constitutional obj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is &quot; &quot; reasonable &quot; &quot; for the coalition partner , must first show itself . &quot;
there &apos;s a lot of it inside that could cause disputes .
&quot; however , the SPD is currently trying to establish itself in the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel first cau@@ ti@@ ously sign@@ alizes conversation and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot;
Volkswagen got off lightly .
&quot; despite diesel engines , deliveries are rising worldwide . &quot;
but not in all markets it runs round .
&quot; in the recall campaign , vor@@ tex is about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen will start the second half of the year with the deliveries .
&quot; thanks to its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to offer a plus in spite of the diesel . &quot;
&quot; but in July , Volkswagen &apos;s core brand was weak@@ ening mainly in Western Europe and again loaded the sales of the company as the company listed in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand sold 1.8 percent less vehicles in July with 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars than in the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; sales in Western Europe , the second most important market in China alone , accounted for sales of 14 percent below the previous year &apos;s month . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries declined by almost a sixth . &quot;
&quot; Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann &apos;s sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann reduced the weaker figures from July , particularly on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it has given a reluct@@ ance to purchase in some core markets through &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British vote for leaving the EU also stressed a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust gas chamber first escal@@ ated , there is also a minus to beech . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected family brand of the Lower Saxony has got off lightly because of the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months , only an extra@@ dition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles is to be found . &quot;
group sales manager Fred Kap@@ pler posted a sales division from January to July .
&quot; at this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles worldwide , 5.@@ 9@@ 04 million worldwide . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust tests with a software .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting into the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the conversion , Volkswagen re@@ affir@@ med that the renovation of the cars has no negative effects . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; after ref@@ itting to the customer , the car manufacturers issue a &quot; guarantee &quot; certificate , but do not talk about a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was on Friday in company circles . &quot;
reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; focus &quot; &quot; had reported that Volkswagen is now offering its German customers a guarantee for sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding diesel models . &quot;
this was confirmed last Monday by VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport .
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was a meeting . &quot;
&quot; VW has fully comp@@ lied with the editions of my Insp@@ ection Committee , and the KBA Commander . &quot;
&quot; deviations from these are not accepted , &quot; explained Federal Minister of Transport Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has assumed the guarantee that fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or motor capacity after retro@@ fitting will not take place and all type @-@ approved vehicle values will remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was named in company circles . &quot;
&quot; for example , with the wide term &quot; warranty , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers to come into a workshop half a year after retro@@ fitting - and this could result in the new software , even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; also in the interest of customers , it is important to avoid that any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal may result in uncertainty as to possible warranty regulations as it was . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , VW does not use the term &quot; guarantee . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands rich savers in future , as a second institute in Germany . &quot;
&quot; Thursday : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s only about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight deposit accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of a single case and does not see any signal in it : &quot; &quot; normal savers would not have to fear &quot; &quot; to pay for their as@@ par@@ ag@@ us criminal charges . &quot;
&quot; if banks camp money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they must pay its 0.@@ 4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee res@@ umes the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September of private and corporate clients for deposits of more than 100,000 euros on sight deposits or daily money accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 costs in the future will be 400 euros a year , &quot; Paul said . &quot;
&quot; for some time now , he has been jumping 40 million euros , which could be withdrawn from one day to the other and which he could not utilize . &quot;
&quot; they are on the central bank account and generate 0.4 percent , &quot; said the bank manager . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million 4000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the costs are now further reduced . &quot;
&quot; letting the cash flow in the v@@ aults of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be much too dangerous : &quot; I have already experienced four cases , I don &apos;t want the fifth ! &quot; said the Bank Chief . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
few emig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the Co@@ operatives Union of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the extreme monetary policy of the ECB causes considerable costs for all banks . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is not possible to bear you alone , &quot; &quot; economically dur@@ ably not possible . &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their account management fees , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
the Thurin@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had head@@ lines with their Sk@@ at@@ bank branch 2014 .
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , managing director of the banking union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private customers to pay blanket fees for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is much too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said , at the T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; a clientele that is endowed with wealth a little more opul@@ ent . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this can become a problem for a small bank , &quot; &quot; if she jumps for free money . &quot;
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs live in the region . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no other banks known to the Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria , which calculate a le@@ aching rate for deposits of private customers , &quot; said spokesperson Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German B@@ anks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banken ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had declared at the end of June : &quot; the threshold to go to the negative vis @-@ à @-@ vis private customers is very , very high . &quot;
&quot; competition is hard , and it threat@@ ens the emig@@ ration of investors to competition . &quot;
the customers in Germany won &apos;t be able to please that in the width .
destination Pl@@ ates : who bu@@ ys records ?
lonely middle @-@ aged men love records .
&quot; before you make a comment to see it under the pseu@@ don@@ ym non @-@ all@@ ot@@ omy male middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the re@@ emergence of records is not to be attributed to a boom in Mill@@ enni@@ als , which would like to welcome the news of physical objects , but to mid@@ life nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ghted at the age of 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely group of buyers . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ des by hob@@ b@@ ys@@ ers - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers have retained their feelings rather for themselves ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending themselves time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v ?
&quot; if this blog is a news report on television , the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy road in Soh@@ o , bear a modest gray suit and gra@@ ze wild before I stand , keep my hands and let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
so let &apos;s take a look at it .
&quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly losing its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialist stores . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation .
&quot; Stu@@ art from Glasgow , 55 , to whom I am from Si@@ ster Ray ( Number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) to Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( Number of data : eight men of middle age , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , do I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have approximately 3,000 or 4,000 records . &quot;
&quot; these gram@@ ophone records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by email , I did not follow him at home ) , dress the walls of his room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford , when she appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late six@@ ties , early 70 &apos;s , that appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I thought was a bit too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy plates are more intro@@ ver@@ ted and like to spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink too much . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump , people who have heard about the com@@ eback and are trying to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have conducted , people usually have gotten out of their collection so as to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom to followers of the plate revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
it takes only a few seconds in a business like Ph@@ onica to realize that record stores offer a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people .
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers hit the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers , from objects that evoke happy memories . &quot;
&quot; I think sometimes it can be the col@@ t of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is like a collector and I think it is so with many people .
it &apos;s a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like her social workers ! &quot; &quot; a worker flows from a stack . &quot;
a survey by IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them .
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , while 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very concerned , while browsing through a pile of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of data : three middle aged men ) , has noticed a &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; of the Revi@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; someone just came here just recently and said : &quot; I don &apos;t have record players , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead sound@@ board so I can put them into the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more productive , less music @-@ class . &quot;
&quot; we have people who say , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older people who only slowly get into it . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records , has a b@@ lower audience when I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around the 70 , tourists who make photos , teen@@ age and middle @-@ aged teenagers . &quot;
&quot; even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze and sex @-@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz gro@@ ans out of the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers . &quot;
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but na@@ ï@@ ve psych@@ ic trauma is hard to determine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , runs around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates for sale . &quot;
it rather makes a window @-@ bum@@ ble as a big shopping .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting plates is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; it drives off with a loving si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I &apos;m giving the impression to mut@@ ate the jeans pants , I watch a group of young teen@@ age girls who group for a moment around Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of records of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , which has more time and money than others , is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my research showed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they leave , at least in record shops in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors , who exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they do not spend their Thursday morning with security with the stro@@ lling through record stores of Ber@@ wick Street and the leaves through sheets , while they steer clear of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old wrong moder@@ ator who raises nothing of middle @-@ aged males over the shoulders . &quot;

French Court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camps
&quot; a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of temporary businesses and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais , in which thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a court hearing this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to En@@ erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , offer hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places were to be demol@@ ished , because they would represent a parallel economy , out of which no taxes would be paid , and that would be a risk of fire and security . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups shared the court that shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also suggested that the provisional businesses and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses , but admitted that the concerns of the pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were &quot; absolutely understandable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that food stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the rainf@@ all was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is commonly used and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
&quot; more than 170@@ ,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids &apos; café . &quot;
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian , it was said that &quot; closure &quot; would be a catastrophe for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the two relief organisations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of people who live in the jungle of the jungle has increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcom@@ ers during the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains milit@@ ant
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing appearance at the Olympic Games , he doesn &apos;t want to miss Tony Martin . &quot;
&quot; I keep in mind the World Cup , stay confident and fight , &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he did not have an explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; I honestly say it &apos;s hard to comment yesterday &apos;s tim@@ eline , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
&quot; he had to analyse in peace , which reasons had led to the de@@ bac@@ le . &quot;
Martin actually wanted to fight for the title at the World Cup in Qatar in October .
I will look at everything that we have changed in recent times .
&quot; this also includes my position , &quot; wrote the triple @-@ time world champion who lost on Wednesday at the 5@@ 4,5 km more than three minutes at the Olympic champion Fab@@ ian Canc@@ ell@@ ara ( Switzerland ) . &quot;

here comes the reinforcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ ers have to adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in different federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic reinforcement trailer of the Vit@@ ronic company from Wiesbaden can be used , for example , at accident areas where it would be too dangerous for a mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on motorway construction sites or to renov@@ ate bridges with temporary Tem@@ plate , there is often no necessary infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the reinforcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts for five days , the case data is transmitted encrypted via a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can be collected across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as drive @-@ through @-@ fly according to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; according to the manufacturer , it is possible to move the trailer according to the manufacturer with each car with trailer hit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; in order for it not to be cl@@ utter@@ ed simply , it is lowered in the measuring operation so that the wheels in the arm@@ oured and by the way also sh@@ atter outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system is designed to protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested by Vit@@ ronic in different federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; foreign authorities also use the new technology : recently , France has ordered 100 copies , following an order of 150 copies last year . &quot;
great Britain reco@@ vers silver in 7 @-@ er ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji Master@@ class Gold picks up
&quot; Britain &apos;s impressive performance at 7 @-@ er Ru@@ g@@ by came to an ab@@ rupt halt in the final hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is , when they were defeated in Rio de Janeiro with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the De@@ odor@@ o Stadium . &quot;
&quot; Fiji granted a master class in handling , side step@@ pes , back , line run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any colour . &quot;
&quot; the defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi@@ fin@@ als on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but regardless of this , Fiji would have defeated a 15 @-@ man team in this form . &quot;
&quot; it could be a consol@@ ation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Br@@ ite will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow : Fi@@ j@@ is head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former head of England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind it .
eight years ago she lost every game at the Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens .
here they lost only one .
&quot; this flap will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fiji began wonderful and caused the attacks of G@@ Bs to boun@@ ce out of fun .
&quot; it felt for Captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if one would run in driving buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au fro@@ ze in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right corner that he turned around . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a prot@@ rac@@ ted T@@ ackle of Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of guy Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa a third goal , but it only stopped Fiji . &quot;
&quot; in the seventh minute , the j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a took a touch down in the right corner and it was 0 @-@ 17 for GB . &quot;
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new song since the restart and there was still over a minute playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pres@@ umes through other weak tac@@ kl@@ ings of the GB team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7 , while GB is still being forgotten . &quot;
this is how it is .
&quot; GB led basic changes to the half @-@ time and closed the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for all four minutes , which was good for the ratios of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant Inter@@ play of Fiji . &quot;
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton started an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Pacific , whose fans sang , sw@@ ung flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the Fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged and the UK collap@@ sed cr@@ ushing into the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi @-@ final with 20 @-@ 5 and Great Britain pressed South Africa in a tight semi @-@ final match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown pushed the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke through the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late Tac@@ kling of Marcus Wat@@ son , the brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the win - and therefore the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspir@@ es the fight with the cancer of the trainer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ less gold than in these games and that wants to mean something .
&quot; from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard h@@ ieve who enter history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning took an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; even if they were only the two who sat at the helm , there were three voices in the boat . the echo of the trainer Robin Williams , was all present when they rowed to the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in Zwei@@ brücken without a control woman , the first women in the history of British sports who put on such a scale . &quot;
&quot; her domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all her 3@@ 9.@@ ter un@@ troubled use , which is also un@@ paralleled . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant female athletes , who gli@@ de across the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which is not reflected in the type of trium@@ ph@@ al march . &quot;
&quot; behind every gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers to contribute to the incre@@ mental progress that make the difference , and no one knows if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ked . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not , it spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty bad situation .
it does not change the outlook .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum , if under such circumstances it is the right term . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better again soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was hospit@@ alized and ran around at the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough . &quot;
this is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing in itself is already a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a busy morning talking with it more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , which was a Captain in the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . this is perhaps something extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it only repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin , we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for exercising or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have lost no race over the last five years .
the couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up , p@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were very caught at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not out to make something great .
&quot; today we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race what we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about its future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , her own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that it was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to realize that I am an Olympic Champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; she said . &quot;
exemplary care taken care of for 31 years
&quot; the Managing Director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , will reti@@ re . &quot;
&quot; the association is regarded as &quot; &quot; Bavarian far exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
a small Fran@@ con@@ ian drinking water @-@ water @-@ association as a model for the large water producers .
&quot; this was the case , some time ago , in the original on a contribution by the Bavarian Radio . &quot;
&quot; a little later , the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia bl@@ amed the purpose . &quot;
&quot; the work of the &quot; &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein @-@ Group &quot; &quot; applies &quot; &quot; Bavarian far as exemplary . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this , Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , who was a co @-@ worker for 31 years , stands for 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
he was now reti@@ ring at the age of 65 .
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , located in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality Breit@@ brunn , promotes approximately 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water annually and supplies 32 places and pastures with approximately 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the congregations are the municipalities of Kirch@@ der , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
water supply contracts are available for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current president , Breit@@ brun@@ ner &apos;s mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , rec@@ alled that Ru@@ pert G@@ öller was appointed as a water wart in 1985 and was appointed Managing Director of the ken@@ nel in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse and they extended from water management and maintenance work on office and organization activities , budget planning , calculation of fees and contributions to emergency operations on weekends , &quot; said the president . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , she called the commissioning and inauguration of the new wells ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of the farmers , the re@@ development of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) , the re@@ purchase of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the replacement of water pipes . &quot;
&quot; there has been no down@@ time , and you have always resum@@ ed innovations because water is the most important food and drinking water is the most important food . &quot;
&quot; in her lau@@ dation she fi@@ gured Gö@@ ll@@ ers loyal , reliable and correct service for 31 years . &quot;
he used a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association and he lived right in the water @-@ pur@@ ging association as if it were his own company .
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein@@ gruppe as a nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia district . &quot;
for that he received a lot of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ öller , for his part , praised water @-@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water wart and he was a faithful boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as a highlight from his point of view , he described the well @-@ being and re@@ struc@@ tur@@ ation of the purpose association . &quot;
&quot; however , the biggest challenge and the most difficult use were the tu@@ b@@ ular break at the Hoch@@ hop@@ per in Kirch@@ der on January 3rd . &quot;
here we had to work at minus 17 degrees all night so that the villages could be supplied with water .
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because one filled the high hop@@ per of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

relationship at Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - Man shooting at risk of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) on Friday at 10.@@ 45 o &apos;clock in a multi @-@ family home in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( district Stor@@ mar@@ n ) .
&quot; the man himself called upon us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; said a polic@@ eman . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , after him will be publicly punished . &quot;
by now Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ fired and has a lat@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
but it is a few years old .
meanwhile the man is wearing a g@@ lat@@ ze .
the man should not be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot;
&quot; who sees Sven S. , should call 110 . &quot;
the police talk about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide information about the di@@ pl@@ omas or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a person was killed . &quot;
&quot; this is a crime of killing . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we do not say more at this time , &quot; said a police spokes@@ woman in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witnesses , a special mission command ( SE@@ K ) was on the scene . &quot;
steel - A light look for German steel industry
the crisis @-@ packed and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in millions of millions .
&quot; financial burdens , which the industry threatened from green electricity subsidies , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Transi@@ tion in the existing plants for the so @-@ called self @-@ current production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; at first , the European Commission had planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use the gas from blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
Gabriel said the WA@@ Z : there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager .
&quot; only when the generators are replaced in the steel works , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent is applicable . &quot;
but also this is not raised in the steel industry .
the IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission for self @-@ electricity production .
&quot; as a result , the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely determined . &quot;
the successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry are of particular importance .
&quot; with regard to our campaign &apos; Steel is Future &apos; , this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; others must follow . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; climate and employment targets must also be considered in the reform of emissions trading targets , &quot; &quot; said IG Metall @-@ CEO Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; since the financial crisis in 2008 , the steel industry has suffered under over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure . &quot;
&quot; last year , the situation continued to ag@@ grav@@ ate as the world &apos;s largest producer in China cast iron on the global market due to the weak@@ ening domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers shed price dump@@ ing Chinese steel corporations .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has become somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel effects , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened up . &quot;
what is unclear is how sustainable the price @-@ up is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp remained cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated . &quot;
the industry re@@ acts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; finally , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to close the closure of individual works . &quot;
&quot; at the end of 2015 , about 8@@ ,000 people were employed in the German steel industry . &quot;
&quot; in July , the German steel producers remain cau@@ tious despite rising prices and increasing orders . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as Steel Division reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the set amount returned to the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an increase in order intake with an increase in output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing is good for sen@@ iors &quot;
&quot; singing Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp has accompanied her whole life : as a young girl she was in school choir , in the Leh@@ ra@@ mt study she took the subject of music , and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in an elderly choir . &quot;
&quot; singing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and overall alive , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; because singing is a great hobby for sen@@ iors , Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler says of the German Senior League . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like @-@ minded people , describes H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
through regular meetings sen@@ iors can soci@@ alize and cultivate social contacts .
&quot; because often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience has also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organize , to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other , a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be ti@@ ring in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; for doing so , sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing . &quot;
&quot; who regularly calls on his lungs , is not so fast in everyday life from the pu@@ ste . &quot;
&quot; even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at the age , singing is an optimal hobby . &quot;
&quot; in older people , singing has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the Federal Labour Association of senior citizens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations the common singing had a much higher value , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and in leisure time , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often ob@@ serves that singing or listening to songs in older people awak@@ ens many memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
&quot; with lyrics and especially melodies , even people with dementia suffer from long past events . &quot;
&quot; in singing , a particular performance is required to the head , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time focusing on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers , this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; especially older people , who live alone , practice not only to concentrate on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition that is experienced by singing in the choir , H@@ ac@@ kler says . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great compli@@ ment .
self @-@ esteem is also growing through singing in the choir .
&quot; showing yourself : if I practise for something long , I will improve and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , there is enough . &quot;
&quot; who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate , even if he thinks he has little talent , L@@ enz advises . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - at 50 singing people , who can hear when a sound goes beside it ? &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for the right offer , sen@@ iors have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone sings from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a sen@@ iors &apos; choir , one can easily connect . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader directly .
many sen@@ iors can also be found on the Internet .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have access to the internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet search . &quot;
&quot; who wants to sing , should necessarily join a chor@@ us , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does well and has something liber@@ ating - that is true for any age .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than han@@ go@@ vers on scre@@ ams of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the sleep of cat babies has on adult animals .
&quot; to their surprise , the mi@@ str@@ ust also didn &apos;t let the males get cold - however they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of natur@@ al@@ ness of cat babies at the mi@@ str@@ ust of the little ones .
&quot; they respond ten percent faster to bis@@ ons of k@@ itt@@ ens who are in great distress , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary Medical School and the Hannover Medical School ( MH@@ H ) found out . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ater also responds to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens , but always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently , the acoustic differences between mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly arous@@ ed young animals are either not percep@@ tible or not of significance for the males , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding of the MH@@ H . &quot;
she is the author of the study published this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous study , the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens are different with the ur@@ gency of their dependency . &quot;
altogether nine adult males and eight female k@@ itt@@ ens were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of the MH@@ H .
they were pre @-@ played for a pack of small children who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and si@@ bl@@ ings .
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample .
&quot; all females , even those who had no offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; Kon@@ er@@ ding said . &quot;
they turned up faster to the speaker when this calls of the very excited k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with sexual maturity .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to babies , whether they were already mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
Po@@ dol@@ ski resorts with &quot; Gala &quot; to Super@@ cup
Hak@@ an Sü@@ kum@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver in Turkey .
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the coup attempt , Turkey again takes place an important football match . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the arch@@ rival between Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay Istanbul , the official line is clear : &quot; business as usual &quot; is announced . &quot;
&quot; even during the arrest of the state of emergency after the overthrow test in July , the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , was not affected . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those who are suspected of belonging to the movement of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which is responsible for the attempted coup attempt . &quot;
there is also no stop before football .
&quot; against the former heavy i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ver , the public prosec@@ utor issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
Sü@@ ver is said to be supporters of the pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len responsible for the attempted coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan .
&quot; although the state of emergency decre@@ ed initially for 90 days is still valid until October , in fact , this really has no effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
&quot; the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; &quot; democracy @-@ guards &quot; &quot; on public places throughout the country declared Erdo@@ gan on Wednesday for an end . &quot;
the sport is - like the whole country - split into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the workers &quot; club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
but what unites the Gro@@ s of the Turks in the face of dramatic experiences in history is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties .
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially due to Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 gates and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the end game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he scored the 1 : 0 victory hit .
the newspaper &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; he was the best in the square . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the Record Champion found a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion .
&quot; after the preliminary kno@@ ck in the Champions League , the &quot; lions &quot; go off early in the Europa League . &quot;
in the South of Li@@ g it only reached rank six .
the season was not good .
the cup was the only way to win something .
&quot; that &apos;s what we &apos;ve done and that &apos;s the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas , the year was better . &quot;
&quot; thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who with 26 season buff@@ ers as Sü@@ per @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ rier @-@ King set the base for the 14th title . &quot;
this is also the reason for the fans to continue hoping for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; after the attempted coup attempt at AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez was only announced after the attempted coup attempt to return because of the political situation in the country after his Euro vacation . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he only has to say it , &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; club boss Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man cited . &quot;
&quot; but the stor@@ mer would have to be willing to wai@@ ve around a third of his annual estimated 7.5 million Euros , Or@@ man made clear : &quot; we cannot pay his salary in Florence . &quot; &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes still have medals at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin had already been locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wers Julia Step@@ an@@ ova is not allowed to start in Rio .
other superior athle@@ tics s@@ inner can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
&quot; Russian swi@@ mmer Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ owa , who had compla@@ ined her start right before the games after a dop@@ ing lock , was mer@@ cil@@ essly played and boo@@ sted during her start ( 100 meters of chest ) . &quot;
it offered a whi@@ m@@ si@@ cal scenery : she was still in the hall with a super@@ imposed smile and had provoked her appearance .
&quot; as determined that she won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a storm storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many other sports@@ men , who go to the start despite the dop@@ ing past at the Rio Olympics . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old belongs to the most controversial figure in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he has been locked twice for dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion is even faster than before ; it is the number one in the world over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds and is regarded as the greatest challenge from U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100m @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven @-@ time world champion had to sit in 2010 a six @-@ month lock after you have proven the sei@@ zure of pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , she had had strong to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended herself . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ cus / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the Olympic Champion of 2012 , World Championships in 2013 and European Championship in 2010 and 2016 was positively tested for the forbidden stimul@@ ant meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amine . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the oral intake and was blocked for six months .
the four far@@ th@@ est throws this year go to the account of the great gold favor@@ i@@ tin .
&quot; La@@ Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ relay / USA ) : the Beijing Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion over 400 m , was positively tested and locked for 21 months in 2010 . &quot;
&quot; a remedy for penis enlargement has been responsible , stun@@ ned Mer@@ ritt . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( hammer throw , Belarus ) : hardly any athletes were recognized as many medals . &quot;
&quot; thus , T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title from 2005 nine years later after he was diagnosed with testosterone dop@@ ing . &quot;
the now 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to leave Olympic silver in 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM @-@ title 2006 because of testosterone abuse .
&quot; the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognised , was due to a verdict of the International Sports Court of CA@@ S . &quot;
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he is ranked second in the world rank@@ ings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record scientist and Gold@@ fav@@ i@@ tin was tested positive only in May , but may still be launched in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world championship , references to taking a banned food supplement were found , the lock of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mild and ran on July 13 . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ates - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian embassy in Thailand was in contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she had suffered ker@@ f wounds and had been treated in the hospital , but I have already left it . &quot;
they planned their home journey at the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the other explo@@ sions on the holiday island Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , also Austrian citizens are affected , is still unclear . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , such as Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; the Hu@@ a H@@ in , located about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok , were first explo@@ ded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bombs . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai police were killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dutch and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning two explo@@ sives went up , and a further human being killed by the authorities . &quot;
&quot; also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
&quot; during the det@@ onation close to the popular seaside resort of Pat@@ ong , a taxi driver was injured after police information . &quot;
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ east coast of the country , a further bomb explo@@ ded , killing an urban employee . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the prec@@ inct of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; after all , det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast and in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ eastern coast called for several wounded . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was said . &quot;
&quot; the bom@@ b@@ ings bear the same signature , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a co @-@ ordin@@ ated attack .
&quot; it is too early to speak of possible motives , but it is probably the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
&quot; in the attacks , Thai media also wanted to see a pattern that is typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not related to the Islam@@ ist uprising movement or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a spokes@@ man in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , one assumes that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities would have kept secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
it is still unclear which group is behind the attacks .
&quot; police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security for important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bomb attacks , but mostly they do not judge themselves against tourists . &quot;
Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace which was used for years by Tha@@ il@@ ands king B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; following the recent bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Thai security authorities fail to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and its environ@@ s . &quot;
&quot; after confron@@ tations between security forces and Muslim populations , there is no need for travelling to these provinces . &quot;
increased safety risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution issued by the military jun@@ ta .
this ad@@ mits great influence to the military during the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said the bombs were an attempt to insti@@ gate chaos , while the country in the direction of stability , an improvement in economic conditions and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military jun@@ ta , which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody un@@ rest , has benef@@ itted itself to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the uprising of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country for years . &quot;
&quot; in the conflict , more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed . &quot;
&quot; almost a year ago , in Bangkok at a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine 20 people were killed - most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
&quot; the right &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is targeted by the Federal Office for constitutional protection . &quot;
&quot; after several regional offices , the Federal Government also provided the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; we see in the &apos; Identi@@ ty &apos; movement &apos; evidence of aspir@@ ations against the free democratic basic order , &quot; &quot; said constitutional president Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ ining of the Deutsche Presse @-@ Agentur in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants Islamic faith or from the Middle East are disper@@ sed in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we now observe the movement as well .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; identity movement &quot; &quot; is a group@@ ing with French roots , which has been active in Germany since 2012 . &quot;
&quot; it turns against &quot; &quot; mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti @-@ del@@ usion &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration &quot; &quot; and the &quot; &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional obj@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identi@@ ties . &quot; &quot;
he said that his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices in the decision .
&quot; groups like the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; try to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; &quot; said the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with a you@@ thful language , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
these are Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is no publicity for one &apos;s own thing .
propaganda should appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports of contacts from the &quot; &quot; Identi@@ ty &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several German states . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he did not have any knowledge . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , potential contacts of this kind are only relevant at some point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the respective party - in this case , the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes their direction and becomes so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognizable .
&quot; in view of the significant increase in legal crimin@@ ates and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ atten@@ d@@ ate said he would not speak of new righ@@ tist terrorism in this regard . &quot;
but in recent years we have found that there can be law @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal group .
&quot; it may well be that other righ@@ tist groups or small groups form themselves , who plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee shel@@ ters or attacks from other right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; however , a nationwide or Europe @-@ wide management of legal terrorism is not recognizable . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
worried about that many attacks came to the account of people who did not appear before in the right scene .
that is the wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the crimes suspect in attacks on asylum are not known before as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing at all with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , who might have been politically in@@ different or elected for example CD@@ U , SPD or left , who , however , have radic@@ alised themselves by right @-@ wing extrem@@ ist sentim@@ ents . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite
the Olympic Games or World Records will not always determine the head@@ lines of the Olympic Games .
this shows the courageous performance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the easily overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia are so slow that it was temporarily out of sight in the TV pictures . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was selected .
&quot; in the social networks , Hab@@ te became a viral inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; but it was rather his not just sporty figure , which attracted the attention of international media . &quot;
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympic Games ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming club .
this is distributed to make swimming known in under@@ represented countries .
&quot; as most athletes run in Ethiopia , Hab@@ te just wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
the first nick@@ names quickly made the lap .
some media called it as &quot; ro@@ ub@@ les of the whale . &quot;
&quot; based on a &quot; prosperity ball , &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; The Sun &quot; with &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; was funny about him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters fre@@ estyle , played no role . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; were also drawn .
&quot; at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;
the appearance of the bu@@ oy@@ ancy chamber from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to stand alone in a run of over 100 metres of free style .
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ sam@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never had such a long distance before the competition .

Ger@@ ets@@ ried - The owner of a store in the new place has been fo@@ aled .
&quot; according to the police , the 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left their business on Monday at 5.@@ 30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;
&quot; when they came back on the next morning at 8 : 15 p.m. , about 250 Euro had disappeared from the cas@@ hier . &quot;

tru@@ mp does not see the im@@ pending electoral defeat so tight
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp speaks at an election campaign in Florida .
&quot; if there is nothing to do with the election to the US president , Donald Tru@@ mp has already an alternative video . &quot;
he then desc@@ ends into the holiday .
&quot; if Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential election in November , it would be quite different : &quot; ultimately it will either collapse , or I have a very , very nice , long vacation , &quot; said the candidate of the Republi@@ can in a telephone interview with the U.S. television station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it does not reach him at the end for reasons of political correctness , be that in order , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; so he called the US President Barack Obama and the nomin@@ ee of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as the founder of the terrorist militia Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance formed . &quot;
post increases in trade with electric transpor@@ ters
an electric vehicle of the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post is planning to sell her electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter as well .
&quot; in the near future , the Group aims to start trading with the transpor@@ ter . &quot;
the post wants to offer its electric transpor@@ ters also on the free car market next year .
&quot; we want to embar@@ k on sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ speaker on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been examining whether they are to be delivered to their own developed stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter , with the letters and pack@@ ets , to be sold to other companies . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ CEO Jürgen Ger@@ der had said that there are always inquiries , for example by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; according to the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group plans to enter the mass production of the vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; in the post @-@ production facility , the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars per year and shift . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ des announced that the company plans to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and , in the long term , provide a complete change@@ over to environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust step towards 2020 , &quot; &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we change the entire fleet .
the Stre@@ et@@ sco@@ oter is active in Germany since 2014 .
GF@@ RP leadership steps down after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business numbers
the consumer research company Gf@@ K exchanges its head Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the back@@ sliding suddenly came - but not surprisingly .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research company Gf@@ K has gu@@ essed that the chair of CEO Matthias Hart@@ mann will be even more uncertain , the longer the successes promised by him . &quot;
&quot; turbul@@ ence at the top of the Nuremberg market research company Gf@@ K : after again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company leadership , the world &apos;s number five is facing a new beginning . &quot;
GF@@ RP executive director wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
&quot; the chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , is already leaving the Supervisory Board with effect from 12 September . &quot;
&quot; as early as September 1 , the management board of the Executive Board of the Board of Management , Gerhard Haus@@ ruck@@ inger , transferred the company to the company . &quot;
&quot; he shall officially assume the function of a &quot; Executive Officer , &quot; until a successor for Hart@@ mann was found . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the back@@ sliding , the company called &quot; &quot; different views &quot; &quot; for long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
details did not want to call a spokes@@ man on Friday .
&quot; in the future , who will lead the market research company in the future , is still unclear at this time . &quot;
&quot; in investor circles , it was last Friday that the shareholders had been a big disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring introduced years ago . &quot;

accidents - Bus stops in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n in Gra@@ ben : eight injured
&quot; in the case of an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( Land@@ kreis Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the in@@ mates suffered severe injuries , told the police . &quot;
&quot; the 66 @-@ year @-@ old coach of the bus of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , according to her specifications , had to devi@@ ate from the opposite truck which was partly on the return track . &quot;
&quot; the bus came to the right of the street and sli@@ pped into a dit@@ ch , as a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund reported . &quot;
&quot; because of the location of the bus the people could not leave the bus automatically , &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and emergency ambul@@ ances came to the accident scene on the Landes@@ straße 2 .
the un@@ last travellers were brought back from a regular bus back to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ ner district P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a spare bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck drivers and possible witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 2.@@ 10 euros as of 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neu@@ dorf / Re@@ uth / Wel@@ leg 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros . for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 26 euros ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( up to now 2.@@ 18 Euro ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the sewage charges will increase later than once again if appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after excessive calculation , the wastewater price in Az@@ endorf will then be 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the budget by the Land Council of Kul@@ mb@@ ach was as@@ cer@@ tained that sub@@ coverings would run for these wastewater facilities . &quot;
&quot; due to legal foundations , the market of Kas@@ endorf was obliged to operate the facilities in a cost @-@ effective manner . &quot;
&quot; as of 1 October 2016 , citizens and trade and industrial companies from Wel@@ leg , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to intervene more deeply in the wal@@ let . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Directors , Herbert Schmidt presented to the committee , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ coverings from the previous calculation period may also be compensated . &quot;
&quot; the serious fee increases were based on Schmidt , making it possible for all three wastewater facilities to operate relatively small facilities with a very low se@@ wer@@ age , between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; due to the low distribution basis , for example , expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the sewage system in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the past period of calculation in all three systems , not least due to their age renovation and repair expenses have fallen into a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf was almost 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ leg , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that in the sewage plant Az@@ endorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage .
&quot; after nearly 20 years of operation , the first sewage slu@@ dge had to be dispos@@ ed of , the sewage slu@@ dge was dispos@@ ed of and an additional ventilation facility to be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future . &quot;
Schmidt : &quot; these extraordinary expenses came with the continued support and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period .
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
stone houses made it clear that in the case of low se@@ wer@@ age in the three facilities the expenses for operation and maintenance are &quot; fully reflected . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs remained spar@@ ed in the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; according to the opinion of stone houses , the situation for the mentioned facilities will remain prec@@ arious in the long run , as the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal wastewater association could not be extended because these facilities are defici@@ ent . &quot;
Bulgaria records inflation for the first time in 8 months
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first has been booked over zero since October last year as positive 0.2 % .
the annual average inflation of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured according to CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase of the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; transportation ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; restaurants and hotels ( 1.2 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and footwear ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices stayed as in the pre @-@ month with alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; and education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critici@@ zed
&quot; Snap@@ chat says that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its filter tool , Snap@@ chat allows some 150 million daily users to change the reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure that could be of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are un@@ blo@@ omed , self @-@ locking tools that generate more than 30 million sel@@ fies sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all abor@@ tions come to the public .
snapshot filters have drawn criticism in the past in which they were accused of promoting the app black@@ face promoting or white skin as a beauty ideal .
&quot; when this week gave some users a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and black@@ ened che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow @-@ face . &quot; &quot;
they wondered if these repeated controversi@@ es pointed to a greater problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; news and ou@@ trage have been widely distributed on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat shared that it de@@ activated the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was designed as homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders who experienced racism , reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ ets were widely used across the photos , said that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and lock@@ able . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yellow @-@ faced , but that the yellow @-@ face has been pulled into the depreci@@ ating extreme . &quot;
Snap@@ chat is not the only company that crosses this cultural pit@@ fall .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and devices we all hold in hand . &quot;
and Snap@@ ch@@ ats great audience of young people - who are more diverse in terms of race than their older counterpart - could expect to expect sensitivity .
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates a picture that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; &quot; it is much more difficult that such things remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday Z@@ hu , who worked as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete their Snap@@ chat account and asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay on medium and in a telephone interview , she said she believes that race @-@ related controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity among the recruitment practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu also critici@@ zed the majority of white , only male leadership and finished their essay using a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce so that they can make such decisions , &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions in which they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that the Snap@@ chat has largely left un@@ answered . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private company .
&quot; on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company has recently set up a staff responsible for population groups and internal integration efforts . &quot;
Z@@ hu told her that she will shut down her Snap@@ chat account and added : &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that this is not O.@@ K. .
&quot; military leadership fal@@ si@@ fies IS@@ IS intelligence information , establishes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; the military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , as the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed , an investigation committee of the congress reported in a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the preliminary report , created by a Task Force of the Republi@@ can members of the army committees , intelligence services and military budget com@@ it@@ ters , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; central Command , short Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida , which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence information , which were typically taken off by high @-@ ranking Cent@@ com com@@ man@@ ders , posted a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on site had allowed and were consistently positive as analysis of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article cited the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; stated Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the management errors in the Cent@@ com range to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training the Iraqi armed forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama gave instructions to change the reports , it shows how analysts faced the pressure from their superi@@ ors to draw an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than it did to the facts , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , a Cent@@ Com member publicly announced that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the Central Command points changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force to life after it was assigned that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State .
the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue .
&quot; in addition , there are further investigations carried out by the Cent@@ com reports by the Ministry of Defence of the Ministry of Defense . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings , which coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force . &quot;
&quot; in the years 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ com created an exc@@ essively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on IS@@ IL and the Iraqi security services , &quot; announced the highest @-@ ranking demo@@ crat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives , B. Schiff , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; this process , so Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the release of intelligence reports , &quot; compensated the mor@@ als among analysts and &quot; gave too little space for dis@@ sent@@ ing opinion . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there was no evidence of a White House intervention in the Cent@@ com analy@@ st with regard to a &quot; certain political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Be@@ ast .
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon &apos;s general inspec@@ tor who received complaints from Cent@@ com Analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ man for the Pentagon , stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on any reports of the Congress , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tor was still ongoing . &quot;
&quot; but he also stated that &quot; &quot; experts sometimes have diver@@ gent opinions on the interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations carried out re@@ perc@@ ussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is meanwhile made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence ) .
&quot; the accus@@ ations of last year have raised the question of what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State rec@@ alled the divisions of more than ten years ago , when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , thought about how the former government under George W. Bush saw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against current reporting on the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team headed by Mr. Hoo@@ ker stated that contrary to the statements made by the government , air strikes against the refin@@ eries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group , since these provisional refin@@ eries would have put in operation to sell oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; however , this recognition was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ Com &apos;s dam@@ al@@ ous commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the legislature for his over@@ ly positive assessment of the situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by the Central Command by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel .
&quot; the US gains fourth match in the field @-@ hockey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before &quot;
&quot; one day after having shot three gates during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; I have no idea . &quot; she said .
I don &apos;t belong to the people who keep their doors in memory .
&quot; however , she knows : the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ on in the first place , who remain un@@ defeated after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first part will be a little bit longer from the strong Dutch woman who will guide the other group .
&quot; as always the game starts on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising vor@@ tex through their success story , four years after they landed at the last London Games at the last of 12 places . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a Ho@@ ckey M@@ ack@@ et in his hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became the national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
she missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re .
&quot; then came the year 2012 , in which for her and her team everything went wrong . &quot;
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , became trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; said B@@ am . &quot;
we did not have the work place in London that we now have .
we have been able to pull the ru@@ dder around completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back @-@ handle from the local area .
&quot; India was gone into the game without victory in the tournament , but the team showed up surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she completed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the middle and pl@@ ung@@ ed the ball into the gate around the Americans to get a 2 @-@ 0 lead . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
it has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the R@@ age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , however late it is also , it is the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and in@@ es@@ capable , a rapid season between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick that is handed over by the w@@ rist@@ band to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ ath@@ lete .
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour in the waiting queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a wom@@ ens s@@ warm with dimples , could well have been among those familiar names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well @-@ being TV ads , if he were a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ asts or even fen@@ cers . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines tournament . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate any event .
&quot; further from the center , partly in the shadow are the sports which are not universally recognized : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast @-@ swimming and may it rule for a long time .
&quot; but if I should modest enough arguments for my particular dar@@ ling , let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline has been an olymp@@ ic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ se for the last 16 years that many who I had questioned weren &apos;t aware that there is an Olympic ath@@ lete at all . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to compete , there has never been a medal in jumping on the tramp@@ ol@@ ines and had had an ath@@ lete until 2012 , who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadi@@ ans for sharing women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal this year .
&quot; jumping on the trampoline has a certain exterior char@@ me , partly because it sounds suitable for the un@@ enlightened ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ al school as the one for the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never ending che@@ ap@@ y - but also the gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving that combines two sports that essentially unites it .
&quot; the word &quot; trampoline &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means so much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; emerging vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land on their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to official Olympic programme , they are rated according to performance , degree of difficulty and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ two athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women , will compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; in their quest for gold medal @-@ fans must go further , faster , up and over , sometimes to the finish , sometimes up and back , upwards and down@@ wards at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they are not only hunting the finish line or the starting wall , but also another highlight in the television broadcast : the world or the Olympi@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; the goal oriented striving is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it &apos;s enough to stir even a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it &apos;s also what I feel as ti@@ ring when watching these games .
the trampoline offers a breathing break .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ lessly like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes upwards , then down@@ wards , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; also here there is a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves in the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be .
&quot; the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the end @-@ hours as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 2@@ pm .
&quot; in the middle of the Olympia @-@ Man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is probably overlooked in the general tum@@ ult . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by an@@ gling and the objectiv@@ ity of male athletes , according to The Wall Street Journal , Mr Do@@ ol@@ ey expects his new fan community . &quot;
&quot; a generation protests &quot; in Ethiopia , Long an ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
&quot; demonstr@@ ators , demanding political changes in Ethiopia , met the government &apos;s violent resistance . &quot;
witnesses say that tens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with the police at gun@@ men .
is Ethiopia just going to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of Africa &apos;s most stable countries , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months , protests sh@@ ook the country against the government and expanded into more and more territories . &quot;
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was ru@@ th@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that police officers shot and killed dozens of un@@ armed demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; circul@@ ating videos about the protests , which are probably from the last or beginning of this year , show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall . &quot;
the head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in @-@ depth investigation .
&quot; it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West .
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terror across the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if ever , get so much Western aid . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a considerable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the roads are usually quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted , although dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent into exile or prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and these don &apos;t have any other options except to protest , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ you@@ m Tes@@ home , a lecturer in central Ethiopia . &quot;
the entire youth protests .
one generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding power of the ruling coalition .
&quot; after a far @-@ reaching vote last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time tensions along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea rise ; a struggle for this sha@@ ky , controversial line challenged hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts such as the O@@ rom@@ o @-@ Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the O@@ ga@@ den have been forced to use tur@@ mo@@ il and arm themselves again in recent years .
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess gradually explo@@ de under the surface .
the first seems harmless : smartphones .
&quot; in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheaper smartphones have become more and more popular and the Internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially for protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they are . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians stated that they were thus gathered to protest .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ res@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ res@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons the Am@@ res@@ as , who come from a@@ edi@@ cs predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , many of whom are Muslims and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this too is changing .
&quot; we are going to coordinate under a screen , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the biggest protests took place in areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ res@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military , secret services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for the un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , had been on Ethiop@@ ian Prime Minister until his death for 17 years until his death in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; he was seen as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was especially vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the present regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ an@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively op@@ aque reasons to take the position of Mr. Mel@@ es . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tiger region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands of elections were prot@@ esting , apparently false by the government and subsequently stolen by the government . &quot;
&quot; during the ensu@@ ing ra@@ ids , many prot@@ esters were killed , even if there were less than in the last months and this time of rest went by relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; development experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal gri@@ ev@@ ance of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it assumes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; last month prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ lian town , attacked by Tig@@ ray , and the hatred of the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in the social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flights over the neighboring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin ti@@ ght@@ rope walk . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his claim Obama has founded IS@@ IS &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; on Friday Donald J. Tru@@ mp tried to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated asser@@ tion , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would be the &quot; founders &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not seriously meant . &quot;
this clari@@ fication sheds new questions on the communication skills of Republi@@ can presidential candidate if he is able to communicate clearly and comprehen@@ sively with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his comrades who try to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position of explaining statements which he could not have meant . &quot;
&quot; having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp insi@@ sted on Thursday &apos;s claim and insi@@ sted on interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning twe@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp told him that he was sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et was the opposite to the previous day , on which Mr. Tru@@ mp had said in a series of interviews , he meant the accus@@ ation completely serious . &quot;
&quot; when the conservative radio comment@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t wanted to help Mr. Tru@@ mp to weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it . &quot;
the last storm of criticism will crash upon Mr. Tru@@ mp as he tried to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand .
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
&quot; on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp tried to return to this subject again . &quot;
&quot; commenting on Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech bored . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defence .
&quot; at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians were to h@@ ack Mrs. Clinton &apos;s emails , but he later declared &quot; &quot; Of course , I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to recru@@ it as needed .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are absorbed by his fans , how they arrive and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction exp@@ ires . &quot; &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; however , I think he is clever enough to hold his statements v@@ age enough so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential election , Mr. Tru@@ mp has adopted an even better tone , since its survey values have gone further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey of N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ ist , which was published on Friday , showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp has generally tried not to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often acc@@ uses his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humour . &quot;
&quot; but while he is intensi@@ fying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mps most prominent interc@@ essors , had a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview of Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I think what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr Gi@@ uli@@ ani said to Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s statements , whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown , small organization , he called them h@@ ul@@ ls , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans are trying to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State , allowed IS@@ IS to spread out to get aggressive under control of the situation in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; before the election events held in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and pre@@ occupied against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the poor , mis@@ erable &quot; television experts who try to understand him and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the demo@@ crats mo@@ cked Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s ap@@ ology as only another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; once upon the price of the market , Café is coming back to Green@@ point &quot;
&quot; b Cafe was a certified café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , in which one could only pay cash , which had no Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices from his Bed@@ ford Avenue shop front were displaced . &quot;
&quot; the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie shop , which was replaced in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local residents compla@@ ined of the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fying city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap market . &quot;
&quot; but if New York is changing , then it &apos;s re @-@ invention . &quot;
&quot; a revi@@ ved Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the verb is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ time employee of the old coffee shop , the owner and managing director of the new cafe . &quot;
he began to work in Ver@@ b in 2001 and stayed there until the end .
&quot; when a client offered him to provide funds for a new outside host , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , maintained a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els bought the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese and there are gar@@ n@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ ted onions .
there are natural rice dishes .
&quot; the café serves no more beer , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by prizes from Willi@@ am@@ sburg , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in former times and regularly visited the club . &quot;
&quot; even after she went to Green@@ point , she would take the path . &quot;
&quot; after the verb had closed , she spent a while drinking coffee , she said . &quot;
&quot; it was clear to me that it was on the coffee and the culture in the verb that was pleasing to me , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now they drink coffee again , even if they ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual iced coff@@ ees , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been another long @-@ standing and loyal customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and in@@ vari@@ ably ordered the same .
&quot; I came fourth , every day , like a s@@ wis@@ s clock and they prepare my Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu . &quot;
&quot; nowadays Ros@@ enthal still receives his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he had no gru@@ dge on the fact that the soap business took the old business space .
&quot; in fact , the owner of the So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to produce a special soap for Ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the coffee shop as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will respond to her offer , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional , Polish residents of Green@@ point have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer has translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said that he proposed to exhibit them soon , so that his new neighbours feel welcome . &quot;
the site also has other advantages .
a local juice locally wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee into the bottles .
there is a chance that the café is expanding to a neighboring building .
&quot; for many customers , a new verb is sufficient to get their old favour@@ ites . &quot;
Joseph W@@ itt was a pedi@@ gree and said that he was destroyed on the ground when the café was closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt told us that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coff@@ ees would feel like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a plentiful meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch at the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a gour@@ mets , President Roosev@@ elt had a passion for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was somewhat more modest : filled eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; said Jane Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ Es Last book &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ez &quot; was the Chinese kitchen in the USA , while Ziegel@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; An ongoing meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday in Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity , when they met with a re@@ porter at the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , sn@@ app@@ y snack in the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered Hack@@ fry , this found the pair suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Ziegel@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there were pe@@ an@@ ut bread , liver cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as a dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have been laid in the stomach as lead , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression , the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ you @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; teams of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served fresh baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to star@@ ving Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; traces the roads with which the country was going to be no longer the land of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when the food for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se theme , &quot; Co@@ e beg@@ ged why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was just as ten@@ se : mysterious food such as bre@@ ads and c@@ asser@@ ol@@ es became a stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ole itself as a &quot; wonderful way of re@@ producing food residues , &quot; as chefs could hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients under a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the center of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange mixtures have been tried , since a low @-@ cal@@ orie and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy kitchen common sense . &quot;
&quot; during her research for the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish from this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Ziegel@@ man continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions do not fit together .
it was typical for many of the home economy recipes .
&quot; like never before or since , household econom@@ ists - among them Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics - between 1923 and 1943 - the country &apos;s eating habits were such . &quot;
&quot; in which she published recipes and articles in newspapers and magazines , she encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and to meet the challenge of turning P@@ amp@@ e like cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots into delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; is a feast of the historic delicacies . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the reports on the government &apos;s response to star@@ ving citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ C@@ ake @-@ Food attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa peasant @-@ house kitchen of his kitchen , he spoke like the million @-@ strong man of the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine such as fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
he ate in an almost gold @-@ plated dining room and carried a smo@@ ker .
he was terri@@ bly strange .
&quot; President Roosev@@ elt might have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or asked him to give an example to his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the present of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Ms Roosev@@ elt caused the White House to produce the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most controversial . &quot;
&quot; many of the types from the era of Great Depression , to deal with food , was rejected as soon as the country came back on its legs . &quot;
&quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said Ziegel@@ man , as well as how science was applied to food . &quot;
&quot; the couple gave a better understanding of the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law when writing the book , for example , how they could not throw food away . &quot;
&quot; she had a real fear of wa@@ sting food , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; Ziegel@@ man remembered , &quot; You actually got sick people . &quot;
there was the incident of the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and Co@@ e pulled out a dessert that they had prepared at home : the dessert recipe that President Roosev@@ elt did eat for lunch . &quot;
&quot; it is called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said and added that it was a usual trick to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , just pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; each di@@ pped somewhat reluct@@ antly to one spoon in the teeth , brown Gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
&quot; amaz@@ ingly , it tasted not bad . &quot;
Co@@ E took three times a night .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do budget , he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in Bom@@ b attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar devoted his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others .
&quot; now , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime . &quot;
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group who , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60,000 people alive . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives on the game to attract people from bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the field of war .
they are the heroes of war in Syria .
&quot; O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of the civil protection , showing him during an 11 @-@ hour rescue of a baby from the rub@@ ble of a house , went around the world in 2014 . &quot;
it made the Syrians the shining symbol figure in the horror of the war .
&quot; but he never saw himself as a hero , said to the picture : &quot; &quot; for me , this is the real ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees in me a mart@@ yr . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself attacked an attack on the victim , he had spoken in a video about the last bom@@ b@@ ings in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; one woman and two children died , seven people suffer from breath . &quot;
&quot; we are now removing the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that children do not play with it , &quot; c@@ ites the picture of his last words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of the Assad regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie usually comes to the surface only in winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats with over 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day .
Greenland has only 150 years of offspring .
&quot; the Greenland shar@@ k flo@@ ats along the ground of the North Atlantic , in an hour it is just 1,@@ 220 metres far . &quot;
&quot; only when it arrives , the five meter long animal acceler@@ ates to a s@@ atin 2.@@ 6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterised by slow@@ ness , seems to be a recipe for a high age . &quot;
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal Science at least from a Greenland shar@@ k who could be 3@@ 92 years old .
&quot; ins@@ anity , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
&quot; although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist predicted long ago , Greenland sh@@ arks would become st@@ ony . &quot;
only the evidence was missing .
&quot; Greenland sh@@ arks are difficult to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ ha@@ ie &apos;s lifestyle .
&quot; her slow @-@ tur@@ pent@@ ine measure , as she offered six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
they may ch@@ ase dor@@ man@@ t animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek cad@@ aver looking from higher water layers down .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sh@@ arks which fishermen between 2010 and 2013 hol@@ lowed out from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depth of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 cm long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ re measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analyzed the lens core of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is created already before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had notably much carbon @-@ 14 in the lens core .
&quot; their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s , when nuclear weapons try to tow greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers in length , the lens nucleus , on the other hand , contained a small excess of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons attempt , so it is likely to have celebrated its 50@@ th birthday during its investigation in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland @-@ arks , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 volumes in its l@@ enti@@ l nucleus , which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the Carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 centimet@@ res long Greenland shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers might be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length .
&quot; because one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years , Greenland @-@ ha@@ ie with the multip@@ lication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time . &quot;
this is also likely to be a world record for verteb@@ rates .
&quot; that such meth@@ us@@ als live above all in icy waters , is no coincidence . &quot;
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Gr@@ ön@@ land@@ w@@ al , whose sp@@ eck on the neck put a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on top , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the living animals often runs on spar@@ es . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slower .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very big . &quot;
the volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat .
the heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , a very large animal should invest its resources into a long life . &quot;
building site in double pack
&quot; in the recent session , the Municipal Council focused on topics relating to building . &quot;
&quot; the committee facilit@@ ated the announcement of mayor Robert P@@ utz , that &quot; finally the marketing of the recently proven residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the property , par@@ cel@@ eration and access questions were clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying were clari@@ fied , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; ( section Bin@@ der@@ straße - Construction Period 1 ) is no longer in the way . &quot;
the Municipal Council is convinced that the cultivation areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au appeal to young families and ru@@ sty sen@@ iors alike .
&quot; as it was said , members of the town council can report from now on the town hall , the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to further en@@ quiries about the settlement of further commercial enterprises , connected to the creation of jobs , the Municipal Council decided not to change the land use plan newly created in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ time@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area already designated there is extended by two plots in the direction of state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; the city on the Main , therefore , has the best chances to attract new jobs and companies from London in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg . &quot;
&quot; it is highly likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , Head of the competence field of financial markets and real estate markets of the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; after the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether the financial stores could continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , they have been admitted to the United Kingdom to date . &quot;
they just use major US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; lob@@ b@@ ying association reck@@ ons with 10@@ 000 new jobs on the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , is speaking the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision over the largest banks of the Eurozone , as well as further important authorities such as the European insurance supervisory authority E@@ IO@@ PA and the risk management ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; although Luxembourg holds a large fund industry , it also cuts worse in the infrastructure as well as Dublin . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the big airport .
&quot; in addition , the city has easily available commercial real estate . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , it is not easy to find free high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;

&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than the competition due to good medical care and infrastructure , as well as less crimin@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the Consulting Mer@@ cer , the city occupies seventh place , Luxembourg to No. 19 , Dublin in place 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a matter of preferences : &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European single market , Frankfurt could attract further banks and investors , &quot; &quot; concluded I@@ W . &quot;

Gilead receives legal costs from hepatitis C patent dispute with Mer@@ ck
&quot; a US judge decided that Gilead Sciences Inc claims to be entitled to a refund of the legal costs , resulting from the H@@ ep@@ ati@@ ts C law@@ suit with the pharmaceutical company Mer@@ ck &amp; Co Inc . &quot;
&quot; in June , Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compensation payment of $ 200 million for violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which in connection with the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the Mein@@ ei@@ des and other un@@ ethical acts . &quot;
&quot; when the complaint was lod@@ ged on Thursday , US minister Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to a reduction of the costs incurred during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck tries to syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze with Gilead , which dominates the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medications that can cure over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case dates back to 2013 , when Gilead and Mer@@ ck used to acc@@ use each other and took possession of the Labor@@ ato@@ li@@ vir , the active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the US say that they have reg@@ ained complete control over Man@@ bi@@ j from the Islamic State
&quot; troops supported by the US have rec@@ ap@@ tured the full control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border , after the last IS fighters in the city abandoned it , said a group spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , following the ex@@ odus of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , are currently exploring the city . &quot;
&quot; they have freed more than 2,000 civilians , who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , Shar@@ fan informed the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reu@@ ters , allied with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under complete control , but we have just begun to clean up , &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons Ear@@ n 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton published its tax declaration on Friday for 2015 , which resulted in the presidential candidate of the Democrats and her husband an income of USD 10.@@ 75 million and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation . former Secretary of State Bill Clinton had spent almost USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ mption Hor@@ ses ; the former Secretary of State issued an income of USD 3 million from Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book on her term in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for vice @-@ president , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine from Virginia , released his tax declarations of the last ten years along with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective 20.@@ 3 % federal tax rate in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards in terms of financial transparency , &quot; Clinton &apos;s campaign hel@@ per J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i announced in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tru@@ mp hides behind false statements and withdraw@@ als regarding his previous promises to publish his statements . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged by law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have indicated a tax audit by the tax authorities as the reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the train , &quot; &quot; wrote Clinton &apos;s election campaign in Ian S@@ lam on Twitter , in relation to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp Special Ad@@ visor , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax inspections were not completed . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Tru@@ mps Cri@@ tics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already vo@@ iced that his refusal to raise questions regarding assets , his donations for charitable organisations , its business units and various other compounds , in particular with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already pl@@ ung@@ ed on the subject and published a video on Friday , calling high @-@ ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp to publish his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she spoke about the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in recent decades , and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; politicians reported that during the 1990s , during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very little taxes , and a business journalist in the New York Times cited a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday that could still be the case . &quot;
&quot; in the election campaign , federal taxes have become a topic . &quot;
Clinton supports a scheme named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett which would ensure people who earn more than USD 1 million a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka called for Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters , Tru@@ mp to discuss their tax declarations . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax check of the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp has &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; in front of the voters and not in front of the tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has been released back until 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons living now in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , on average paid an effective federal tax rate of about 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; the tax return of the Clin@@ tons of 2015 showed that these are only USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their major investment was a cost @-@ effective index fund , from which the Clinton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ds and fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as Ele@@ phant Protection
wildlife conserv@@ ation@@ ers in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going into settlements in people - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ pu@@ ds .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea years ago , intensified their funding by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania to use a non @-@ violent four @-@ stage method to protect their homes and crops without hur@@ ting animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is World Phone Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we were able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , with much confidence that they can keep the eleph@@ ants off their fields without har@@ ming the elephant , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the light of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; ch@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;

city coun@@ cill@@ or decides unanim@@ ously : no new building at the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects take on commercial stri@@ kers with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - however , the retail sector in the core city is regarded as clearly extending . &quot;
&quot; the municipal coun@@ cill@@ or , however , refused to apply for the new building of a shop on the banks of the Rhine in the immediate vicinity of the Rhein@@ bal@@ kon@@ s currently under construction . &quot;
&quot; in principle , we welcome new trade professionals , but at this location in exposed location on the Rhine river this ki@@ osk does not fit , &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U faction . &quot;
&quot; Jewish director dis@@ integrates Berlin hotel , because Israeli pres@@ election was removed after &quot; &quot; Arab &quot; &quot; invitation - RT News &quot;
a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media clock after he had betra@@ yed that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin had no Israeli pre@@ fix as there were Arabic guests according to an employee .
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentary &quot; Sho@@ ah , &quot; left his anger at Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin by writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country selection list of the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that can be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , possible that Israel was eliminated and er@@ ased ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel via its own call center . &quot;
&quot; after an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; shot him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel staff said that the measure was a deliber@@ ate decision of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel management .
the reason behind it triggered even more anger in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ des @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; great shame &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were horri@@ fied and dis@@ ma@@ yed by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain is even an even greater dis@@ grace .
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather big resonance on the Internet , in which people called it a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some of them subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel to the alleged demands of the Arab guests .
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; said it in another post where it was pointed out that the hotel located in the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly dismissed all alle@@ gations and called the incident a &quot; &quot; seeing &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; ap@@ ologi@@ zed &quot; &quot; at Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order to not include Israel into the hot@@ line list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung cited a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code is now added .
police force Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as &amp; rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
&quot; on Thursday , students met with the police in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo , when they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system . &quot;
the police deployed tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began when police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , leading to the fact that the police deployed rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students took part in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation about the plans .
&quot; according to the Gover@@ nor of the Federal State of Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools are closed , while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest participants were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the latest protests occurred a few days after demonstr@@ ators went to the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia and Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Teher@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions were lifted against Iran , the interest in Russian companies grew strongly in stores in the country , the ambassador informed . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies are taking existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to access the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , further commercial exploitation is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran reached 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade recovery was achieved by supplying machines , agricultural vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan dates from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia this year .
&quot; last year , the Russian Foreign Policy issued some 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 of the countries as far as the number of tourists in Russia is concerned . &quot;
&quot; it could be said that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes to change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the towns of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d to have preserved the monuments of ancient Persian civilization in a good condition , &quot; he said . &quot;
witnesses wanted : drop down beverage market in forest br@@ oth
a rob@@ ber@@ y case has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening at the Be@@ we XXL beverage market at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the support of a gun , three dark dressed people who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces from the drink em@@ ark@@ et left the issuing of cash and subsequently fled at first on foot and then presumably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money was captured , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1,@@ 60 and 1,@@ 70 meters in size , so relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly visible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; after the raid , the perpetr@@ ators have to be stretched towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and escaped from the gravel parking place located opposite the parking in the park , possibly towards B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; those who made observations at the time of action ( at 19.@@ 45 a.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y attack , must urgently report to the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : fun and fun at summer
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the socio @-@ educational day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their assistants on their summer holiday in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet Lei@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle leisure park , the joyful group was quartered in the first week of school . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand we went to B@@ oul@@ der with the visit of the stro@@ el@@ z@@ oos .
&quot; to the other to Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guidance in the world famous monastery . &quot;
the third trip led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
in the Celtic museum in Hoch@@ dorf the group learned a lot about everyday life and food of the Cel@@ ts .
&quot; on the hot days the group was jo@@ king at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited for jumping , swimming and plan@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers were treated with their homemade cour@@ ty@@ ards like the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ er Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese . &quot;
&quot; workshops were made to create beautiful pieces of jewellery made of beads and stones , or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; other highlights of leisure time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; &quot; Bun@@ te Abend . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the day of departure , the sun was laugh@@ ing and the children and young people returned to their homes . &quot;
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgrims at the Do@@ or of Mer@@ cy
the ministers from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the road on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were mastered . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time to the next Roman pilgrimage of all the regi@@ stran@@ ts for two years , the ministry round St. Anna has decided to prepare and carry out a several @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; several pilgrimage destinations were examined and finally decided for the bishop &apos;s city of Freiburg , where , during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered on the occasion of the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy at the Freiburg cathedral . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , and Gre@@ ol , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and holy rooms , went their way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , Re@@ ver@@ end Stor@@ ost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the crosses and shared the pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point of Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster @-@ old loved woman is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster started . &quot;
&quot; the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers , songs and written texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is stopped at field cross@@ ings , chap@@ els or churches again and again to sing a song from specially made pilgri@@ m song booklet . &quot;
&quot; for the nights , the par@@ ishes of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; at the stage destinations , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty dinner and breakfast . &quot;
&quot; on the second day , Fur@@ tw@@ angen went to Gü@@ ten@@ bach on the second day . &quot;
&quot; after that , the stage came to St. Peter , which was the most exhau@@ sting stretch of road , but at the same time , some 500 meters of altitude had to be lowered at high heat and then climbed again . &quot;
the deserved reward was a joint barbecue at the beach in the evening .
&quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to the final stage to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly reli@@ eved and happy , the Min@@ is met in the late afternoon at the Freiburg cathedral and passed through the gates of mercy . &quot;
with a little impulse God was thank@@ ed here .
&quot; at the evening Mass in Münster , the Min@@ is of Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t were welcomed on the pilgrimage site . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and the high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the Brei@@ s@@ gau metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner stor@@ med home as Br@@ ite Gold won for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner ra@@ ced last night in the Vel@@ o@@ rom men &apos;s spr@@ int in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor role , which his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y had made . the jubil@@ ee proudly made the legend when he stor@@ med home to win a victory from the favor@@ ites New Zealand . &quot;
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
&quot; they repeated the trick after they held only a modest sixth place in London , despite the withdrawal of Ho@@ ys in March . &quot;
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as execution .
Ho@@ ys retirement created a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
&quot; Sk@@ inner was the man in whom they remained , when they saw potential in the Sc@@ ots , which has now un@@ folded . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ des , Kenn@@ y - four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner set an Olympic circuit in the qualification rounds , but in the stand@@ ars the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won in the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; Hin@@ des lag behind his lap , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , in which Hin@@ der rode in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenn@@ y and especially Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked from his position as BBC expert and dropped Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ des when they got on the podium . &quot;
the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; it is a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make me a name .
we set up an olymp@@ ic board in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the triumph in 2012 at the side of Kenn@@ y and Ho@@ ys , Hin@@ des admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track . &quot;
he with@@ drew this statement later and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such problem . &quot;
Hin@@ der said : &quot; it feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot;
we have come together as a team over the past three months .
we did so badly with so many world@@ titles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympi@@ ad .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the past five months , we expect successful five days in the cycle of Vel@@ od@@ rom . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible to win Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y - who was exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who also was born on March 23 ( apparently holy date for British sports ; on that day Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same as Ho@@ y .
Kenn@@ y takes part next in the Sprint that will start today and will go for three days .
&quot; the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said , &quot; I just enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; Hin@@ der said : &quot; &quot; if he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ four kilometre race . &quot;
they arrived in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the World Record , which won gold in London 2012 , was at 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place on the second day of the competition where W@@ ig@@ gins will focus on security .
&quot; yesterday he had argued with delegates before the qualification , when he called him function@@ aries to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; in the corresponding women competition , which will be continued and finished tomorrow , Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ el S@@ hand@@ ler , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World Record Time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick a band of medals .
&quot; after a truly exceptional representation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; dra@@ mas took place in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April was in the midst of sex@@ ism and mut@@ iny repro@@ aches and the retirement of magn@@ itu@@ des such as Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Vel@@ od@@ rom , it looks quite as if the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which has reached its peak at the perfect moment , will be repeated again . &quot;
future of the s@@ undry of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy loss question@@ able
&quot; the future of the aluminium mol@@ ten from Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the system operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby abol@@ ishes all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year , no further subsidies to the operation of the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years is running out in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
not less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , as the enam@@ el is consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa closed the Point Henry melt , which led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant last year . &quot;
the melt of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land is losing money and risks a closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melting workshop with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three further owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture between Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p holding smaller shares . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process , &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were called &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should come into force from November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a period of 12 months , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17 , &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
all potential impacts on the income on AG@@ L from the G@@ J 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong fut@@ ures prices for wholesale electricity prices .
AG@@ L informed that the value of the contracts had already been written in his annual subscription in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; anticip@@ ation of a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said that the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; Ab@@ ility of Al@@ co@@ as ... to operate the melt , or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; is not impaired . &quot;
&quot; the US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang , who should have come into force from November this year , even if it is still an explanation as to why it res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the branch before the possible closure of the Port@@ land melt in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago plant near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts and a total of around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year . &quot;
&quot; if both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and it wouldn &apos;t be good for us as a generator , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; more than just a Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an reality TV star , K@@ end@@ all is on the cover of the September issue of the Vo@@ gue &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner , 20 , Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner clan Kris is on the cover of the cov@@ eted September issue of the American Vo@@ gue . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der and ran at the Fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced the news on her Inst@@ agra@@ m account on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; the cover of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply keeping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans similar ? ) , a critical reality video that shows the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an @-@ Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of the problem cases Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n ) , as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic twist : they all planned a surprise party . &quot;
&quot; this represents the stere@@ otyp@@ ed action of nearly every birthday episode of a children &apos;s programme ( Se@@ ac@@ rest brought the sentence , &quot; &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; , &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon squ@@ ad at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls somehow participate in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September issue of the Vo@@ gue , a new era of kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans has certainly begun . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as far as the Vo@@ gue cover was concerned ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league . &quot;
the September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles more an illustrated book than a fashion magazine , the issue attracts a large number of advertis@@ ers ( Accor@@ ding Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were 6@@ 15 pp advertisement pages of the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome . &quot;
the revelation of his cover @-@ stars is expected so eag@@ erly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leak@@ age before the official announcement .
&quot; women who were already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , there were clearly more celeb@@ ri@@ ties that model@@ ed as &quot; Models representing celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar winner and Di@@ or brand ambassador J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honour . &quot;
&quot; but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner , who is described by the magazine as the &quot; breakthrough model &quot; of her generation - falls below the previous category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people of today who know how to shoot a good snapshot video ( even if everything applies to Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s success doesn &apos;t like everyone . &quot;
&quot; with its reality TV history , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the fashion world was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; in June , the former Victoria &apos;s Secret model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed her and called her &quot; the mi@@ st@@ let@@ os of the moment . &quot; &quot;
these feelings were once again high when the news came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue Cover .
but lying around on the mis@@ fortune seems to drop by the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
she makes advertising for your pri@@ mer of Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ ford &apos;s daughter to the magazine W@@ TV .
and in her free time she is in reality TV . probably just to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; municipal convention centers exhibit 160@@ ,000 people each year &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary des@@ erts are rejected each year by the local government centers , while the industry is preparing for the impact of further cuts on already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy workers , victims of violence and those who have no means for unfair del@@ u@@ sions and similar - are rejected in their search for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already fully util@@ ised , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; from June next year , these legal centres will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
the director of Que@@ ens@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l &apos;s community centers said that the last survey conducted by the National Association of Community Centr@@ es revealed that thousands of people have already been dismissed each year .
Far@@ rel@@ l said that the situation would only be worse without lifting the decision of the federal government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s community centers are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , which means that thousands of people from important services you need are rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relationships , people with insur@@ moun@@ table and oppres@@ sive debts , families who have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been dismissed un@@ just - all these people have problems of legal nature and this elevation shows that they cannot get the help they need . &quot;
&quot; from June 2017 , the Federal Government will cut the funding by 30 percent , which means that thousands of people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the Federal Prosecutor and Federal Justice Minister as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately cancel these cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the state government fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for guidance on the national average . &quot;
&quot; it is now time to look at the needs of the community centers and their communities , and that the Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k government is investing in this important work . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp election campaign accused of allegedly pulling a gun
&quot; new York : Donald Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign has been accused of in@@ action , after she was told that her campaign leader for North Carolina in February had directed a gun to a staff while traveling in a je@@ ep in February . &quot;
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was submitted on Wednesday in the Charlotte District Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; he gave up , for months , to have been waiting for the matter to be regulated internally before he realized that &quot; this would not happen . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; pulled a gun , put his right index finger on the trigger , and cur@@ led the course in Vinc@@ ents Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; B@@ ordin@@ i admitted in his accus@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; after compla@@ ining about the local and regional campaign management , B@@ ord@@ i stated that at least four other persons had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he was charged with the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to raise damage , &quot; &quot; stated B@@ ord@@ i . &quot;
the indictment comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate triggered a tur@@ mo@@ il when he told a crowd in North Carolina that the &quot; Second A@@ mend@@ ment People &quot; - fire@@ arms owners and arms @-@ friends - should take action if his rival H@@ illary Clinton should be elected and appoint judges .
Tru@@ mp &apos;s campaign clearly stated that the media would have ri@@ pped his words from the context and that he would not inc@@ ite violence .
&quot; complain@@ ant &apos;s complaint requires damages from the campaign for violation of due diligence , and Philip for bodily injury and lasting psychological damage . &quot;
Tru@@ mp spokes@@ man Hope Hi@@ cks was not able to achieve an opinion .
try to contact Philip as well .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer employee of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; responding to calls from his consulting firm , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , was not re@@ acted . &quot;
&quot; until now , Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has led a controversial campaign . &quot;

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before country elections : SPD and CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the Federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( 4 September ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , significant losses for the SPD and CD@@ U ruling parties are drawing . &quot;
these were representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition could go@@ vern in the north , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; however , in both German states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue to face the head of the government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell by 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent five years ago to 24 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party only sm@@ iled just before the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is disputed between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented with 19 percent for the first time in the country day . &quot;
&quot; despite slight losses , the Gre@@ ens were back in the Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses ( previous 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP are not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 per cent .
&quot; according to the survey , the SPD , according to the survey , only reached 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; it is thus still behind the Gre@@ ens with 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but before the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
the Af@@ D would be represented by 14 percent for the first time in the Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties .
&quot; with 5 percent , the F@@ DP could hope for a return that the pirates would miss the move in contrast to 2011 . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; e @-@ mail and internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , the Nokia Communic@@ ator came onto the market . &quot;
the success@@ ors now dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , so it wasn &apos;t good either . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was pretty bul@@ ky . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory at the beginning was eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would now suff@@ ice for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator was launched exactly 20 years ago , on 15 August 1996 , in stores - and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can still buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hannover as an &quot; office in the West pocket format . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for those standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax the communic@@ ator was to be contacted . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible by using HTML browsers , albeit qu@@ el@@ ly slow . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
there was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop .
then there was a small keyboard and a black @-@ and @-@ white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 euros . &quot;
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
since then everything is different .
smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia .
&quot; the Finn@@ s mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster , was eventually sold and handled to Microsoft . &quot;
today the market is dominated by suppliers that all came much later than Nokia .
&quot; always and everywhere online , this is today for a lot of people everyday life . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; about 1.4 billion devices have been sold , Samsung and Apple alone account for 5@@ 55 million units alone . &quot;
worldwide sales with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app providers and telec@@ oms companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has been developed around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came first in 2007 , at that time , Apple boss Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the i@@ Ph@@ ones . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : one music player , a phone and an internet @-@ communic@@ ator , everything via touch screen easy to use . &quot;
&quot; Apple &apos;s trium@@ ph@@ al march began , the iPhone is still the most important product of the company . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had the look . &quot;
&quot; she finally van@@ ished , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
the smartphone is a matter of course for 20 years after its invention .
&quot; on average , every German now has 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all have to learn to put the Smartphone away , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , in charge of the Siemens Management Board . &quot;
permanent accessibility is now considered a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw
&quot; He@@ a@@ throw will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London , but throughout the country . &quot;
&quot; for me this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ throw , just as in 2012 in London , when we had a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympics brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities alone , we will create 10,000 new jobs alone , create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead of us in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of expansion He@@ a@@ throw is too great . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be bl@@ aming ourselves on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong even at He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcome , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , £ 2@@ 11 billion in spir@@ ited growth , and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the whole of the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have a great team at He@@ a@@ throw , which has implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from the T@@ 5 - which was built five years in succession to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , up to T@@ 2 , which was built in the midst of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to provide a third run , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
London &apos;s 2012 games were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and extend He@@ a@@ throw as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and jobs that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; according to one of the software manufacturers , attempts to circum@@ vent ad block@@ age are the same for companies who earn money with online advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that there were blocking signs on its desktop side , Ad@@ block Plus released a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop side would change the coding related to its advertisements in order to make it difficult to detect the indication that is part of the page advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass the new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , the spokes@@ man of Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ forth struggle between the time @-@ giving open source community and the conver@@ ters has been underway since the invention of display lock@@ ers &quot; , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying indicator blo@@ wers have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people use display lock@@ ers worldwide , almost four times as much in 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising makes 84 percent of advertising revenue Fac@@ ebooks . &quot;
&quot; the company relies on ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad blo@@ wers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a speaker . &quot;
&quot; advertisement on desktop PCs is a sufficient amount of revenue , so Facebook appears worthwhile investment of such a step . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad preference pool &quot; &quot; in order to have more control over the adverti@@ sed advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ bloc &apos;s new filter would be wor@@ rying because they would also block content on the page that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; this is not a positive experience for the users , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; said a Facebook speaker in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a bl@@ unt means , which is why we have instead focused on developer tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of people . &quot;
woman suspected of suicide on Swiss highway
the victim was on the highway in the middle of the night .
the police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday transferred to a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles on a highway .
the incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d shortly after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; in an act of despair &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49 , including a lor@@ ry , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died on the spot .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police said these as well as every witness of the incident prompt to report . &quot;
&quot; an investigation procedure was opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter informed the Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed . &quot;
was a collision avoid@@ able ?
&quot; that is something the prosec@@ utor has to decide , &quot; Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter said . &quot;
two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held ac@@ countable .
&quot; in each of the two cases where a person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after crossing a man who killed a man on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
&quot; the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street , took judgment . &quot;
&quot; the court found that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- proc@@ eeded in a justified way and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; &quot; totally unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation &quot; , &quot; said the judge . &quot;
anyone who has more information about the incident on Thursday near Morges should report at the police under the number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably hab@@ itable . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus , with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere , could have had similar conditions . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ ily @-@ like atmosphere and still turned on slowly . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth , but once had enough water and geographical vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from quicker evap@@ oration . &quot;
early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day @-@ side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; declared G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds , which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today .
the model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planet researchers .
&quot; although she was originally hab@@ itable , Venus -- over the course of several billions years --@@ was exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their steam was fired from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gen , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which we know today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy comes back as a coach of the Aval@@ an@@ che
&quot; Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che , leading to low co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noted that the association will immediately look for a new coach . &quot;
&quot; in the last three years I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and Vice President Of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determin@@ at@@ eness , &quot; commented the 50 @-@ year @-@ old Roy in a statement . &quot;
&quot; during the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , needed and to bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; to achieve this , the trainer and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations needs to be perfectly matched to the organisation . &quot;
he must also have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are currently not met .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; today , Patrick told me about this decision , &quot; Sak@@ ic said . &quot;
we appreciate all that he has done for our organization and wish him the best for the future .
&quot; during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 , Roy was recognized as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards as the best trainer of the league . &quot;
&quot; he led the association to 112 points and to the first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was beaten in the first round of the pla@@ yo@@ ffs of Minn@@ es@@ ota and missed in each of the last years the post@@ season . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches posted a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell behind the Wild for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy has won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two pieces with Montreal and Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ des@@ ee@@ öl@@ emen pick up discussions again , strike a strike &quot;
&quot; the labour struggles on wages for North Sea oil workers will be exposed , while all parties of the parties put themselves on the table for a new round of talks , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the oil field service provider Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally conducted on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; the Wood Group as well as the Un@@ ites and R@@ MT Trade Uni@@ ons can confirm that we have agreed to restart the process of stri@@ pping the current dispute , &quot; &quot; it says in a joint statement . &quot;
&quot; we will keep some day @-@ to @-@ day sessions in the next few weeks , starting next year to restart the problems . &quot;
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which was the first in over 25 years , was a protest against possible wage cuts of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year Wood Group has shortened the rates to its counter@@ parties in the North Sea by around 9 percent , due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s credit rating follows a 10 percent drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts gave the company the space needed to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released thousands of people and announced plans to give up its oil and gas business activities in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lines its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure because of the lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the decision of the British in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the largest labour disputes that took place in the North Sea for a generation .
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not just for a few , &quot; &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion are expected for new projects in the North Sea compared to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rotation rates below the stars of the Ple@@ j@@ ades Star Cluster .
&quot; the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars are rotating in star @-@ loops to different rates , as well as in what connection the rot@@ ational periods stand with the planetary origin . &quot;
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other star loops , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the earth .
&quot; many stars in this star @-@ run , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now turning to the fastest .
&quot; at peak rotation rates , these ri@@ pen@@ ing stars rep@@ el large amounts of star winds . &quot;
&quot; as these winds travel through the magnetic fields of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aged , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognis@@ ing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun@@ spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rotation rates indicates that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull compar@@ es the stars with dancers , with larger stars of slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes rotate as smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rotation rates . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ stellation of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; we want to learn more about how , how , when and why stars slow down their rotation rates and hang up their &quot; &quot; dance shoes &quot; &quot; so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades &apos; rotation rates , which will soon appear in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial bas@@ eball star ki@@ cks off
&quot; at Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , the tears ran faster than the US bas@@ eball star in the best days of Base to Base . &quot;
&quot; after his emotional departure announcement , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old pro will be wearing the Tri@@ cot of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es on August 12 against the T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &apos; Goo@@ db@@ ye &apos; , &quot; &quot; explained the 14 @-@ time All @-@ Star Game @-@ Parti@@ cip@@ ant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; thri@@ ce Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract gave him 27 million US dollars a year since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will act as a consultant and youth coach - at full salary . &quot;
&quot; as a player , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez paid a long time with performance . &quot;
&quot; with 6@@ 96 hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Navy ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he made some mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame @-@ members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two more bas@@ eball players have similar values in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 @-@ year @-@ old is not likely to be recorded in the bas@@ eball Hall of the Bas@@ eb@@ alls . &quot;
because so successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - on the field was so controversial his appearance outside the square .
&quot; in 2009 , the super@@ star admitted to &quot; &quot; ES@@ PN &quot; , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 forbidden ster@@ oids to have taken . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was blocked for 2@@ 11 games due to involvement in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis sc@@ andal until the end of 2014 . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect for years to have received an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a law@@ suit , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done me a favor for the year 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said at that time sweet . &quot;
also his farewell days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends play the big stage in their last games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job involves trying to win any game , &quot; said Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and described the relations with Pop@@ star Madonna and the act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy from fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; the supporters sang at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympia 2016 : chen X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing sample , Wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland will not start in Rio . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games are over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing attacks .
a well @-@ known ath@@ lete would have won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing attacks have become known for the Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese swi@@ mmer Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ meter obstacle course in Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded - immediately before the beginning of the critically observed athle@@ tics competitions these messages come to the end . &quot;
&quot; last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was detected in Ch@@ en , which is used as a mas@@ king agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the CA@@ S International Sports Court confirmed its expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old had reserved the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butterfly , only by 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the runs of more than 50 m Fre@@ estyle . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) has applied for the opening of the B @-@ trial and a hearing .
&quot; the national association takes the matter &quot; very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; commented X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; we will work together with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C , but the CA@@ S , is responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also at the night of Rio , the message se@@ eps through the positive rehear@@ sal at Dan@@ ek@@ ova , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went into the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth test was positive , &quot; this was &quot; an incredible shock , &quot; she said to the Bulgarian TV broad@@ caster B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; be innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; explained the ath@@ lete . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , it should deal with the forbidden substance for the blood dop@@ ing agent EP@@ O . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ ova was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ sample should have already had a positive impact . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s prime minister Bo@@ j@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v promptly dealt with criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why athletes don &apos;t have the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for instance , all wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing @-@ laden nation must not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday the case &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested positively on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon three days earlier . &quot;
&quot; they both start taking , but both of them are not allowed to start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athletes , the case of Dan@@ ek@@ ova is a further serious blow to the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the world association IA@@ AF had forbidden the entire Russian team to an exception for systematic dop@@ ing , even the nation of Kenya produced numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the swimming @-@ racing , the former off@@ ences in China also caused sharp conflicts between the athletes . &quot;
the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang Har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la . &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium above 200 m Fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also the focal point of a discussion with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing che@@ aters , &quot; &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun had been positively tested in the Chinese champi@@ onships in 2014 , but only had to sit on a three @-@ month lock . &quot;
Dat@@ enk@@ lau : per@@ fi@@ de black@@ mail h@@ ack@@ ers their ran@@ som
programmers of black@@ mail malware are currently targeted at companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once , partly multiple victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion . &quot;
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som paid by the perpetr@@ ators in order to recover the challenged systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes to attack corporate networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to obtain ran@@ som is much higher than in private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a start@@ ling spe@@ edy evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most Mal@@ war@@ e@@ programs were still designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for himself .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to corporate attacks was frigh@@ tening rapidly over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works according to a simple pattern : once on a victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ ts the ran@@ som@@ ware and del@@ etes the origin@@ als sustain@@ ably .
&quot; afterwards , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; to get the end key code to the files , the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryp@@ to@@ graph Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; but where private users find the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases , without which production still stands still . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage falls when a ran@@ som@@ ware is added . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to break down business operations , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be ac@@ utely ac@@ utely ac@@ utely affected by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say the victims : do not pay , you only promote the problem , &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again . &quot;
&quot; for managers , it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators in the face of stand@@ still in operation . &quot;
&quot; the h@@ ack@@ ers , in turn , know this and try to build a good reputation . &quot;
&quot; in a recent study , the Safety Res@@ ear@@ chers of F @-@ Secure explored the use areas and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain their victims per chat , how they can pay by Bit@@ coin , set up freely accessible support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for free example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros , companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit amounts to withdraw their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively ris@@ ky gains from ran@@ som@@ ware ex@@ tor@@ tion , the h@@ ack@@ ers become more professional and share their work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the antivirus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware about within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers sell their malware in the form of a software construction kit to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the existing malware kits were created by the malware itself , advice and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and 10,000 dollars . &quot;
&quot; included is an adaptation tool so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail owners are looking for further h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the newly bought software among the victims .
we live in a service sector .
&quot; thus , one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set of a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per infected computer .
&quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of Ran@@ som@@ ware is now well @-@ known among many companies that better secure their data .
more than 50 percent of companies in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes Con@@ vey@@ ed survey have confidence in preventing ran@@ som@@ ware using file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if data encryption is not a sufficient threat to successful exhaus@@ tion , the perpetr@@ ators are threatening to publish sensitive data such as customer lists or pricing , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chief Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the potential for damage is much higher than before , depending on the type of data . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetr@@ ators could also face new targets on the internet of things in the future . &quot;
&quot; at the h@@ acker conference of Def@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the Internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of winter , the activation of such blocked heating could well be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become a topic in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; Honda wants to pack everything in the small HR @-@ V : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and also the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have a lot of space in the first row as well as in the rear , it does not work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and work pleasant , only the cockpit side is a little bit off . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is much more versatile than comparable vehicles .
&quot; there is not only a luggage compartment of 4@@ 53 l with elevated and 10@@ 26 l rear back@@ rests , but there are the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like kin@@ os@@ ets and thus offer storage space , which is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor to ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded well , but the loading height of 650 mm is slightly higher than that of the comparable Peugeot 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V power@@ fully thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; he should , however , set up his work somewhat more quietly . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine : a 1.5 litre petrol engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynam@@ ism and comfort . &quot;
but steering is likely to be more direct .
&quot; in the tested top variant &quot; Executive , &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security systems include the city emergency brake assistant ( working up to speed 32 ) , the collision warning system and the lane assistant . &quot;
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because it ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; when maneu@@ vering .
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent speed controller re@@ acts to the traffic sign recognition and th@@ rot@@ tles the speed if required .
&quot; but the full connectivity is only available for the top equipment : 7 @-@ inch touch screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two US@@ B@@ - and one HDMI jack are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore somewhat cum@@ ber@@ some .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top diesel are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive the gasoline engine from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot;
the motors comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
airline not liable : down@@ fall on passenger bridge
an airline is not liable for the down@@ fall of a passenger on the passenger bridge .
the Higher Regional Court of Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued that a liability is conceivable only with haz@@ ards that are typical of air traffic .
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee joint in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident could have happened everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline did not have to pay compensation to the man .
case of disease : when does the organizer get paid
&quot; after their trip , dise@@ ased vac@@ ation@@ ers will only get money back when the cause of the disease is beyond doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case if more than ten percent of the guests were reported to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negotiated case , a family was severely affected by diar@@ rho@@ ea and vom@@ iting on the second day of their door@@ step . &quot;
she spent almost the entire holiday in the room .
&quot; their disease brought back the vac@@ ation@@ ers back to a defective pla@@ inti@@ ff , which allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water . &quot;
the family thought that the trip had been insufficient - and compla@@ ined against the organizers .
&quot; in court , the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the treatment plant was in fact defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before the pla@@ inti@@ ff &apos;s departure .
until then he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he has therefore not viol@@ ated his duty of information , so the judgment . &quot;
no im@@ puri@@ ties were found in the samples of the water .
the illness of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belong to the general risk of life .
of 6@@ 91 guests only 38 were ill .
&quot; de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , would have worried many people about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be pru@@ dent and determined at the same time to react to terror .
sure is : our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hatred and division .
we won &apos;t allow this triumph to the terrorists .
&quot; if offen@@ ders have to leave the country faster , they increase the security and also strengthen the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; he also announced a further personnel strengthening of the security forces , namely &quot; in medium four @-@ scale magnitude over several years . &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; sympathy for terrorism must be punished again . &quot;
&quot; video surveillance is to be improved , the right to arms will be amended so that the purchase of weapons on the Internet is made more difficult . &quot;
the last much discussed sweat @-@ duty for doctors shall remain maintained according to de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to seek solutions to reduce the threat of citizens , he said with regard to mental ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter the radic@@ alization of refugees , the Minister considers a better social support . &quot;
teachers need to be better prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
&quot; to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning the use of concealed investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything that contributes to further increase security . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is important that the Minister of the Interior clearly spoke against Action . &quot;
&quot; this was a cow@@ ard@@ ly for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said to the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke Media Group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had rejected calls from the Union following a Bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of double nationality .
a general prohibition of full @-@ wear is problematic for constitutional reasons .
&quot; you can &apos;t for@@ bid everything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ ka . &quot;
you can talk about rules about street traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; green boss Simone Peter proposed to the Minister , he wanted to simulate with ever new anti @-@ terror p@@ act and maneu@@ ver@@ ability . &quot;
left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; fleet S@@ prü@@ che and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay do not bring people to safety in this country . &quot;
better traffic on the motorway
it is regularly st@@ owed on the b@@ ypass road - here is a picture of November .
but this should change : the law of law shall be extended .
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers , who are in traffic jams on the ambient road every night if they drive via the motorway in Zu@@ br@@ inger ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) in the area between the Hammer road and the De@@ er Wes@@ er Straße , road construction will be extended by 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then go right from the hammer road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic for@@ ks early on , thus improving the overall production sequence on the busy section of the Federal Highway 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea with the extended exit had the CD@@ U faction in the district , representing Münster @-@ West . &quot;
the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder is annoying drivers especially between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock .
&quot; on week@@ days , the return leg goes up to the bridge over the Alber@@ slo@@ her way and sometimes also beyond . &quot;
the reason for this is the needle @-@ eye on the B 51 shortly before the departure Wes@@ er Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only guided one lane via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be built before a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations showed that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity , in order to record the heavy load traffic two @-@ lane . &quot;
&quot; as long as this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the related factory daily traffic is maintained , the competent state operation cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , it is to be expected with years : the bridge has an official remaining duration until the year 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal system , the state operation deliberately chose the traffic @-@ less time during the school holidays , because with disabilities to be expected . &quot;
the traffic will be passed on on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
intercultural journey : culture offers for schools
&quot; the international class of the forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; The invisible house &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge theater are planning a music project .
N@@ ima &apos;s association enables young people with migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
the &quot; Class International &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Kinder@@ haus has visited an idea of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; Das Un@@ seen House &quot; of the Junge theater Münster .
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by N@@ ima &apos;s association , 19 students from eleven to 15 years spent the staging in the small house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most young people in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 among others from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster and speak little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic images and video animations , it was possible for them to follow the course of action nonetheless , according to the press release of the boy Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from spra@@ ys , and the Junge theater will work together in the upcoming season as part of a musical theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December young people with and without a flight and migration background between 14 and 20 years will have the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the areas of singing , dancing , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the field of theatre play and theatrical language education are in the planning stage .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association reck@@ ons with many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement of weather
the weather has taken the star @-@ schn@@ u@@ ff @-@ Gu@@ ck@@ ern in the southwest of Germany in the night a stroke through the bill - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was not suitable for clouds and rain to observe the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the chairman of the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , on Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we will see many star @-@ trun@@ ks in the sky . &quot;
&quot; the star @-@ shed is Per@@ sei@@ den , which is one of the fastest star @-@ trun@@ ks with 2@@ 16@@ ,000 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they appear to come from the con@@ stellation of Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleep disorders
&quot; in the evening , you roll around etern@@ ally , at night you lie awake for hours , in the morning you can no longer think of sleep long before the alarm bell rings . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; according to the Robert Koch Institute , approximately one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons underlying them , emphas@@ ises Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eks , board member of the German Society of Sle@@ eping and S@@ leep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what you understand , however , is the in@@ som@@ nia , that is , a distur@@ b@@ ance and sleep distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; seeing through sleep many people perceive as uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German pet association with practice in the Lower Saxony Var@@ el . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; organic , psychological or behavi@@ our@@ al factors can be found behind them , but also medicines . &quot;
&quot; often , sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder . &quot;
&quot; very early awakening is often common in depression , &quot; &quot; said We@@ eks . &quot;
and it can be that different factors require each other .
&quot; who , for example , has a disc failure , can lie badly , w@@ akes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to pon@@ der about everyday problems and worries , We@@ eks gives an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should you sleep with sleep disorders a doctor ?
&quot; who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected the day , should go to the doctor advises the process . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment may look quite different : you are beaten , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; to allevi@@ ate sleep disorders , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ oral changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; there is hardly any psycho@@ analy@@ st in Germany , emphas@@ ises Prof. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary research center at the Char@@ ité University Hospital in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; therefore , in case of sleeping problems , one should first turn to the family doctor , advises the process . &quot;
it can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for example , in case of snor@@ ing with air@@ drop@@ outs , in case of illness fatigue , in case of sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , Fi@@ etze explains . &quot;
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normal .
&quot; only please do not make a n@@ ap , &quot; &quot; says Fi@@ etze . &quot;
&quot; after sin@@ king , one goes into the bed for his normal time . &quot;
&quot; besides the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera is drawing on the ceiling to the sleeping end . &quot;
how can suffer@@ ers get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can sleep for a better sleep .
&quot; We@@ eks counts : regular sleep and sit @-@ up times , lying not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch television for sleeping , avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then one starts to reck@@ on immediately , and that is quite and not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German Schwi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has expressed himself on Facebook for dis@@ ap@@ pointing cutting of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he premi@@ ered gold for the first time in Doh@@ a &apos;s short @-@ track world champi@@ onships . at the same time , he set up his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V @-@ Ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler has placed himself in front of his ex @-@ te@@ amm@@ ers who are standing in the cri@@ tique . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic champion gets $ 20,000 bonus and a jungle king of 150@@ ,000 , nobody should wonder about missing medals , &quot; &quot; wrote the 26 @-@ year @-@ old on his Facebook page on Friday night . &quot;
&quot; the convey@@ ance system in swimming is bad , however , dop@@ ing controls are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a great deal and do not look so closely at dop@@ ing , or even operate it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that the controls should be set here , &quot; &quot; he continued . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be announced nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency Germany ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly the way you should keep it with countries .

airport : ban@@ de arrested by baggage theft
professional thi@@ eves at Düsseldorf airport
&quot; on Thursday , the police of Düsseldorf police managed to arrest two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had made several bags and baggage @-@ ste@@ els as a gang .
&quot; at 9 : 30 , civilian officials in the area of the Düsseldorf airport recognised a gang that was known to police officers from past theft . &quot;
&quot; since mid @-@ July this year , the two women and two men have committed several crimes and have been involved in a joint , labour @-@ friendly and particularly professional manner . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the &quot; &quot; Criminal Police &quot; &quot; 34 can prove to the thi@@ eves which had been specifically entered into Germany for the transfer of crimes to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , they had captured over 15,000 Euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , in between still a rest of cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in does not look like this , but the police are one of the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; when one goes along the road from east to west , one passes by play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a Bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
on the facade of a grey house someone has &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; spra@@ yed .
&quot; compared to a Li@@ dl , which is to be demol@@ ished soon , a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017 . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , articles about this &quot; trendy neighborhood , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in calls , is preferred by burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with the number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have le@@ ased contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , especially the Berlin indoor sen@@ ator Henkel had spoken several times for a hard procedure of police against the project , the area referred to as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June , the premises on the ground floor , the Cad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , had been evacu@@ ated with 300 police officers , with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers commissioned by the unknown home@@ owners commissioned the rooms . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin Administr@@ ative Court decided that the clearance was illegal , and one day later police and construction workers retired from sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the street works peac@@ efully : parents walk with children , people sit on the side@@ walk in front of the houses in the sun , others talk about late i . &quot;
&quot; in the immediate vicinity of the house projects , there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens . &quot;
&quot; lef@@ tist violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who lives in Kie@@ z since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who runs three children here , is mostly anno@@ yed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the residents of the building projects , they share the concern about increasing r@@ ents and gent@@ ri@@ fication . &quot;
it doesn &apos;t sound like a Kie@@ z who wants mostly police protection against v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left .
&quot; the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin interior ordin@@ ator and the police do between house @-@ occup@@ iers and their neighbors , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Friedrichsha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class neighborhood , which also today has a low average in comparison to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty . &quot;
&quot; in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer Strasse in close proximity to the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer had been evacu@@ ated under large police charges in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in Riga and are partly occupied by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the district has become a magnet for tourists and elec@@ tors from around the world over the last few years . &quot;
&quot; this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
many of the new@@ buildings in the R@@ ī@@ ga are attacked as symbols for this development : one can recognize them at dump@@ ed windows or freshly painted fac@@ ades that were thrown with color bags .
no other road was mentioned this year along with the words &quot; lef@@ tist violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason for not seeing all neighbours as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime : crimes like body injury , according to statistics , are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; most of the crimes make property damage , which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years , there can be no talk of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as far as violence is concerned , it is important : people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been that . &quot;
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Riga Zoo .
&quot; for the studied architect , her street is not a criminal focal point , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately pulled into the Riga Stra@@ it - and remained .
&quot; that is why it was so important to her that the residents got their way back : from the police , politics and the media , which in July all suddenly demanded the sovereignty of the city . &quot;
&quot; however , in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former building gaps that the old inhabitants are displac@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; these are ultimately con@@ domini@@ ums , which are not interesting for many - here people who are not so good are living here , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; violence and destruction I can absolutely not appro@@ ve . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but what should one do if someone never li@@ stens ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding for those who are anno@@ yed about colour bombs : the Hau@@ tes and the left @-@ wing scene belonged to the Kie@@ z .
&quot; who prefers , should be aware of this - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a pub district , can complain badly about noise there . &quot;
all persons presented with the first names have asked not to be called by their right name .
Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact partner for integration and organis@@ er .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Refu@@ gee Officer for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of administration around Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; it sees itself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee assistance , administration , authorities and who else is involved . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thank@@ ful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is there , the ei@@ ving Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau , which has above all a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less mo@@ cking than on the multitude of desired tasks - had pur@@ pos@@ efully - meant that the administration wanted to leave the place . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people , combined with many years of experience in the field of social work , just an experienced wool mil@@ ky sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not its central area , says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organization , work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for six weeks .
it has a 50 @-@ percent position limited to three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time players . &quot;
&quot; there are large and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
soon there are new containers in the washing line
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been acknowledged .
the municipalities are responsible for connecting the connection .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired living rooms .
&quot; the costs for the construction , rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the Coun@@ cill@@ or Office to the Commune and Job@@ centre .
problem : there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment .
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
&quot; de facto , the administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it does not work so far , one relies on private apartments , such as Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , common dwell@@ ings need to be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful . &quot;
so soon new containers will be placed in the washing line .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine &apos;s customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence , there are intern@@ ships , training centres , school courts , one @-@ euro jobs and employment services for refugees and migrants who need to be repaired or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help home masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that motivated and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
she hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers like sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are ra@@ r .
&quot; so , here too , administration and honorary officials jump here . &quot;
it is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; you need to explain to the refugees that it takes a long time to bridge them , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; if you develop the feeling , he can &apos;t help anyone in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be useless , he will never be able to integrate himself . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is , therefore , always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a &quot; mam@@ mot@@ h task . &quot;
&quot; a difficult question : did the two follow the latest incidents of fear of radic@@ alization , even in a small community like Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says clearly , &quot; &quot; what some nai@@ ve might call . &quot; &quot; a residual risk could and should not exclude it . &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to the refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins would bring them completely to call .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
&quot; thus , main and honorary officials must look out for activities in the region and in the region . &quot;
they are always in the background that a new push to refugees and migrants will soon come to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a cap ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , politics is afraid . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is unfair to place them on site . &quot;
&quot; we have not arrived in Ur@@ bach where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , that would be able to relax . &quot;
&quot; also , Reg@@ ine customer makes clear that the Ur@@ bach is already busy integrating the previous people in a reasonable way . &quot;
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but when people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ars looking for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew off several areas for about an hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men were forci@@ bly entered into an apartment in an apartment house in Lin@@ den@@ weg on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 am .
the villa@@ gers surprised the two and hit the un@@ fet@@ ched .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters tall , probably mas@@ ked , wearing both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies . &quot;
they fled the direction of the city .
&quot; at the same time , the police deployed several expe@@ ditions and a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag went without success .
&quot; perhaps the unknown , in fact , fell near the apartment or on their escape . &quot;
