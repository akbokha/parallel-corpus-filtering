<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">"at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa, Bernhard Langer with some colleagues sought a little diversion with a ride on the beach."</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden World Pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted at home in a fast gallop home."</seg>
<seg id="7">"a kilometer at this speed, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," "says Langer."</seg>
<seg id="9">And so the riding career ended again.</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer was all times - 101 tournament victories - again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let himself be led with his family about the installation of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even swell for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for a long time, the first time in Aachen and therefore also at the CHIO."</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the German sports aid handed over to the man from Anhausen, as part of a small gala, the Golden World Pyramid."</seg>
<seg id="15">There is no lack of awards for the sympathetic sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Bundesverdienstkreuz, Silbernes laurel leaf, champions-tour-player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already ordered him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th prizewinner of the sports pyramid is long.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, he met the first laureate Hans Günter Winkler on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting success but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he continued the prize money of 25,000 euros in the same way."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US Masterssieger was added to the" Hall of Fame of the German Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the Turner Eberhard Giant, the Fechter Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Rudder Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the pioneer Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official ceremony, the illustrious company emigrated to the Springstadion, where the Lavazza Prize was running."</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton and Trumps Economic Policy in Comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">"" "investing in infrastructure and preventing TTP trade agreement - they want both Clinton and Trump."</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are in the tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental question."</seg>
<seg id="4">"differences in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are based on a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">"that, on the role of the state."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to keep them small and warn of how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy to death and regulate death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself, on the other hand, would be quite different, says Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will greatly go back to regulations, and he is making himself strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private people and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Clinton, on the other hand, says: the state has to fulfill certain tasks, it has to open disadvantaged chances and needs money."</seg>
<seg id="11">"therefore, taxes would be increased for the rich, it says."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to the topic infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost immediately."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate announces the largest investment in new jobs since the Second World War.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programs in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are rejected by the state-critical Teaparty wing of the Republicans.</seg>
<seg id="16">So there could be no internal discussions on Trump.</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are more evident.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and drive up coal mining in the US.</seg>
<seg id="19">Oil production should also be possible in protected areas in so far as he wants to announce the Paris climate protection agreement.</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend and demand Renewable Energies with its investment program:" "a country will become the super power of clean energies and create millions of jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want us to be there."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only in the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpactional trade agreement, do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them want to isolate the US from international trade - but rather simply protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should also be paid better, say Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a famine.</seg>
<seg id="27">It wants to increase it to 15 dollars per hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to be rushed, then he says he must not be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is probably more likely to develop around the tax policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, there is Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and the citizens to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">"his critics uphold him, that the budget deficit would be even greater."</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton who wants to ask at least from the rich wants them to pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="1">Escape: "every winged woman has experience with sexual violence"</seg>
<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who flee on their own, almost from everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">In a large kitchen there are four women.</seg>
<seg id="6">Each one has a baby with a maximum of one year old.</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in her arms.</seg>
<seg id="8">He gazes curiously into the room with great eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the table top.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you speak with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the Managing Director of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance services in Bavaria, and deals with the issue of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the northern part of Munich in one of the few decentral accommodations for all-frozen women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs set up the institution together with Pro Familia and the Munich Fraud Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">"recently, it was officially opened."</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">There are no men - not as visitors.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has experiences on her escape experiences with sexual violence," Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically, because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them to Europe as a hopeful decision." "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, other reasons outweigh the flight:" "many people secretly steal from it, because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland, they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, murder, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">This drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"the fact that tugs for example require a sexual act for a bottle of water is not a rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"and the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, err, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"even here, single women in refugee shelters would often be regarded as inferior and abused in the worst case."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this means that around 90 percent of women who live in the accommodation in the Munich North are traumatized, they appreciate."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not created voluntarily."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are so used to say nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they don't dare to talk openly about the experience, because the shame is too big."</seg>
<seg id="36">"since they often don't know how to help, more accommodations only need for them, asks Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew about a similar project as in Munich in their jurisdiction, some answer with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Upper Palatinate and Oberfranken, for example, there is no such thing in accommodations of governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"also in Swabia alone, fled women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, spokesman of the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in the Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are limited floors or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations only for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality, in the European Parliament, also calls for women to be separated from men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the Committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women be accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or men and women are accommodated together, it can be - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"in particular, the washrooms should be separated and easily accessible to women, is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need of protection can be read from the crowd, which there is to the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since we have talked about it, we have a long waiting list," Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="49">You could easily make a second house.</seg>

<seg id="2">Representatives of the assistance doctors have called upon their union to approve new work campaigns in their disputes with regard to a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) required its entire Council to approve more work campaigns starting at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that the ministers agreed to deal with the concerns about the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, resident doctors and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of its members who voted for the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government" persistently quiet "would have stopped problems, which led to the fact that the treaty was rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "in view of this, the JDC Board agreed to completely reject the proposed new treaty and request official new negotiations for all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in response to the silence of the government, the JDC board today submitted a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running program of escalating work campaigns starting at the beginning of September."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the controversies led to the fact that resident doctors saw six times, the first overall failures in the history of the NHS."</seg>
<seg id="11">The head of the BMA resident physician Dr. Johann Malawana returned after the election to reject the agreed contractual conditions recommended by the BMA.</seg>
<seg id="12">"he shared BMA members during the sessions, which took place before the vote by 54,000 assistant doctors and medical students, with the fact that the contract should be advantageous and accepted."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "Alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and announce an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of St. Petersburg Palace, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was the handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin's smile seemed narrower and he hardly radiated heat, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">Recep Tayyip Erdogan on the other hand spoke of his "dear friend" Putin - according to a report all five times.</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but will even improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan had behaved like this would never happen."</seg>
<seg id="11">It seemed to me that his enthusiasm seemed to suggest the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin's radiant, sustainable cows showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in his introductory words: the shooting of a Russian fighter plane on the Syrian border of Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was kindled.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin divided and accused Ankara to fall back in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">Leaving was even greater since it was done by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building the veto again becomes difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">Public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media launched a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at once, it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the most serious were the accusations of senior officials that Erdogan's own family had benefited from illegal oil trade in the areas of Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has vehemently denied this.</seg>
<seg id="23">But in St.Petersburg the official message was that it was time to look forward.</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin received the apology from President Erdogan, which he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a ceasefire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the first instance, Erdogan needs all the friends he can get after he has been relieved of almost his ministry last month with a failed coup d" état. "</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken him.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - especially the prohibition of charter flights, which usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast each year."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when the flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal attack on the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television predicted cheap fruit and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Večsti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry to the West, as it looked at its reaction to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the continued grudge on the snail pace of EU accession negotiations and Putin - who is eager to benefit from the cool mood and reduce the relationship of Turkey to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in Ankara, the Russian head of state secured a claim that after the attempted coup d" état he requested support for the elected state organs. "</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, a matter of course that itself has a deep-seated fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this brilliant palace at the sea enabled Russia and Turkey to present an" alliance of outsiders "to Russia and Turkey: two countries that are violating the West and feeling ill treated, and now fading."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, despite the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow recently played the role as a peacemaker, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it could be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents met at the press conference that they had not even stripped the issue."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasize this."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in view of the potential for a perfect disaster, when NATO member Turkey showered the Russian fighter jet - it is certainly better that the two leaders speak at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="16">"I now say that we are not pursuing global goals, but local goals."</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will be completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious State Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the website of the Kremlin, it is called (in Russian) that he later became the chief executive and Chief of Staff of the Registrar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"over his appointment, he said to Putin:" thank you for your confidence. ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the government's most important task to support your work as head of state regarding bills and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked for leaving his post and Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Do the smiling faces convince?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov, for a long time, was one of the narrowest trusted Vladimir Putin's and works as he was for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin, which was broadcasted on television, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff will resign on their own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the ridicule for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">Is this the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official assertion - that a man, once praised as a potential president, suddenly wants to lead Russian environmental policy - came across great scepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, who are quoted on the Kremlin website, Ivanov said," "It's true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012, I could almost say - entrust this post for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV accepted the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">Previously he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence.</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as a former member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was President of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed to his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people he trusted in most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was assumed that Ivanov could become President of Russia after Putin's second term, as a third term Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, closely affiliated ally of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>

<seg id="2">The £1.35 billion project to be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">Engineers have connected the North deck of the Queensferry crossings to the Viadukt - meaning that the bridge is now connected with Fife.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "deck blower", "which are approaching completion by each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">The bridge section of Fife is now 600 metres long and weighs 30.000 tonnes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tonnes of concrete as well as 46 helical ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The £1.35 billion project will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown put a visit to the construction site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," This is a historic and symbolic moment when constructing the Queensferry crossings. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic measure in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, the completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky activity requiring extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"all in all, almost 79% of the bridge deck is in place and the last section of the deck gets a concrete shot for the deck in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted on the bridge at its place."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructor said:" the first lock represents a significant milestone in every bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this fantastic project, the closure is a trendsetting high-rise and civil engineering."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north turmodeck located in the extension, we had to close the existing gap on the north or land side."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was achieved by dragging the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and simultaneously very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive because the viaduct is 222 metres long, weighs about 6.000 tons and had to be pulled up at a incline of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"because the tolerances that the team works, the tolerances were tiny - on each side they were just a few millimeters."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds favorable apartments in Braunschweig?</seg>
<seg id="2">"in future, the SPD and the Green Party said," "Investors are expected to be much stronger in the future."</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Brunswick will lose nearly 1300 cheap apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">"at the next council meeting, the SPD proposes a" "housing concept living". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it is about the question: who should build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing so far.</seg>
<seg id="8">"s & D Group president Christoph Bratmann believes:" "we agree with the Greens: who wants to build on urban areas must in future have to exhibit 20 percent of all apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be built in stock."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the main point in the town hall is," said Bratmann: "how do you deal with investors who want to build on private land?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent in such areas, but to build as much as 20 per cent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing construction programme, which will cost millions and still needs to be financed, shall provide incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, says Bratmann:" "there is no agreement between the factions at the moment."</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU would like to make investors as few as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants even tougher conditions for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, as Bratmann, there is an intensification of the situation on the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the concept of action is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the construction management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is needed.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is unclear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"however, the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which were to be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you balance the loss of another 1,300 affordable housing, which will expire in the coming years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, the budgetary spokeswoman Nicole Palm should now be busily purchased from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be thought of getting apartments back into the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at one stroke, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">"for in the western city, the end of the year is running out."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be picked up there back into the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing companies."</seg>
<seg id="30">"because the number of social housing in the western city is increased dramatically, one removes itself from the goal of so-called mixing."</seg>
<seg id="31">There should no longer be a concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens expect that there will be movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"said Group president Holger Herlitchke:" "for a broad majority the CDU has to go to the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">This has focused on more building sites for single-family homes.</seg>
<seg id="35">But what does not mean that there is still a compromise to be found.</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to watch the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"teenagers and children can no longer go outside to play, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time staring on screens, has been lamented by many over the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and getting more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and finally on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">Therefore it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other.</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to the Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app based on the characters that were initially created for the video games in the 1990s (later a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs were created)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"like many pop culture phenomena, the interest in the publication of the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand declined slightly in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">Market launch in other countries was postponed by massive demand that overloaded the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokémon that are tracked with a GPS and once they have been found," photographed "(via a screenshot on the phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the jahn and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable increase in steps that the" average "person returns every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, followed by 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently reported that within two days after the game was launched, the number of subsequent people who exercise 30 minutes each day, jumped from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays Pokémon Go - it only sees the raw data for improving performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns to health that people want to" take 30 minutes time "to" come from the sofa "and" to be active every day, "because many public messages are boring for health and come from people who look elend."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, the importance of sport cannot be overrated."</seg>
<seg id="19">"who regularly drives sports, reduces his chances of developing cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that is too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the wonder at Pokémon Go is that it will bring people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - motion, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even make new friendships on the hunt.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also grumpy toys that have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could run against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What should I do?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough happened.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if Smartphone-Apps like Fitbit could track our activity earlier, they gave us no reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will fade with time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to Pokemons's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the asset in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, fitter and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="13">"Biles is the fourth heterosexual American, who wins a multi-campaign title and is the fifth, while she solidifies her call to be the best of her generation or even at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">She burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey in that moment came to an end.</seg>
<seg id="15">"this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael Phelps, who brought their sports to new heights:"</seg>
<seg id="16">"Biles has dominated the last three years, 15 world champions - including 10 gold medals - with so amazing exercises that include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion from 1984 Mary Lou Rescue from her said that she is" the best gymnast I've ever seen. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"she was expecting a final examination in Brazil, a competition that didn't go so much between Biles and the rest of the athletes, but rather between her and a load of oversized expectations."</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine under the women's olympionship in the Turnen and that of more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first of all, I have been at every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"and secondly: this team has three turrets, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, who inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew is and Madison Kocian, the Catholicon, rounds off, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and Hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female Turnerinnen was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple World Championships in Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they delivered unexpected but masterly gymass routins."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event for women."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but do not look like gymnastic classes throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="16">"Simone, Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it the Olympic team."</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" "Last Five" "because the next Olympic stadium will only have four gymnasts in the team. furthermore, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality is that Turns is an expensive sport and Turner is primarily involved in private sports clubs, which are maintained by parents who are responsible for training, orientation, travel, competition and hotel costs (for trainers and their gymnasts and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of these trainers are in prosperous suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the gymnasts receive their entire training and this is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, trainer of Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, both exercised their athletes since they started gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we need to be inspired by the communities of aun numberous young girls who are inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, providing a more affordable and accessible exercise training."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my TurnKey for 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable tourism in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban young people (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer youth high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and profit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determinateness for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for academic and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">"it is the inspiration of this team, which bring thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnastics and that's great."</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine representation of" Girl Power "by bringing the Olympic team golds and thank you, you motivated so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed contract with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 resident doctors, who voted for a vote, rejected him."</seg>
<seg id="3">"in July, Hunt plans to introduce the contract, and said that the NHS would be found in a" "Niemandsland" "and that any further delay would be detrimental to the employees and patients."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the first assistance doctors shall receive a new contract, which contains changes to night and weekend bites, in order to improve the maintenance at an astounding clock time."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Dr Ellen McCourt, the chairman of the BMA committee for assistance doctors said last night in a message:" assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract, in particular that it will heat up the current workforce crisis and admonish it to handle all doctors. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract, progress has to be made and time runs out."</seg>
<seg id="7">"efforts by the BMA to resolve disputes through discussions met with the government on reluctance to participate, and at times deafening silence."</seg>
<seg id="8">This was the case of a promise that Jeremy Hunt had made only last month that his door would always be open.</seg>

<seg id="13">"the BMA wants a better weekly wage for the 54,000 resident doctors who are subject to the contract."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Daniel Mortimer, Director General of the NHS staff, asked the assistance doctors to stop the strike."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Mortimer said:" "work combat measures do not achieve little harm, but already pollute overloaded teams and service providers and prepare the patients, caregivers and their families only sorrows, distress and interruption."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the last two months, we talked to the committee of the assistance doctors and responded positively to the concerns about guardianship and whistleblowings with the Ministry of Health and other ministries."</seg>
<seg id="17">"employers hoped that the continued positive engagement on other important topics - such as sending, flexibility in training, additional training for those who return from a professional time, schooling, mutual recognition of the curriculum, training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers, the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health regarding compliance with the agreements with the BMA in November, February and May."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness Blooming electoral fraud in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">The former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutsk Rahman was removed last year on the dismissal of a government report due to corruption from office</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a crushing government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the former member of the cabinet, Sir Eric Pickles, verbally attacks the police, election monitors and town halls to ignore the evidence of misuse due to" "hypersensitivity to ethno and religion". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister of Integration and Municipal Government, who is now an answer to corruption, said that the intimidation of votees from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off shut-off tapes outside of electoral cabins to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should have a certificate with them, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter only needs to call his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply non removable ink on the finger of a person when they release their votes to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">Whistleblowers should get more protection says Sir Eric.</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to community documents and decisions of non-official committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only for election fraud, but also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and financial betruction culture associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlets election scale in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court decided that the acting mayor Lutsk Rahman after a litany was to be relieved of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">The court found that Rahman had perverted the religious feelings of his Muslim community "in cynical way" and that he would have silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia.</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it is the religmatic duty of Muslims to choose him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 voices were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which one person chooses someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said that there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he expressed alarmingly to the fraudulent letter of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to elect a candidate of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including the leaders of clues to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"it is stated in his report:" "as proof that pressure is exerted on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities, especially women and young people, in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistani or Lebanese background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... State institutions would have knowingly ignored such a behavior due to "politically correct" hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric said 50 recommendations to clean up the system, including the ban that political activists edit mailshot documents in order to stop" "voting". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social purposes."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Do not use removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Carry out systematic reviews of the nationality of a person to ensure that they are optional.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limitation to applications for an automatic postal code.</seg>
<seg id="28">Ban that political activists edit full post-elections and envelopes of letters.</seg>
<seg id="29">The police force the authority to set up shut-off stations.</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of law that facilitates an indictment for intimidation in accordance with the Representation of the People Act 1983 (Legislative Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographing prohibited in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the polling stations (with the exception of Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">Intensification of the training to ensure that staff generally enforce that voters go on their own in the choise cabin alone.</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric falls over the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after Tower Hamlet's case no criminal complaint was placed.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the Constitutional Court has declared Lutsk Rahman and his deputy to be unsuitable because of a litany of corrupt and illegal practices," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="36">He was found guilty of a number of reasons - in accordance with the high requirements in the criminal proceedings.</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the effective "check checks" of the election registrations of the town halls.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of the parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the buyers did not know where to go, when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a primarrow to try out underpants."</seg>
<seg id="3">"to make the situation worse, she looked as she looked at it, pulled her out and put them back into the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they rumbled on and tried four pairs of signatures in a shop at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, Germany."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the primary store at Bouverie Place Shopping Centre in Folkestone, where the woman tried the underpants, before she put them back into the shelf"</seg>
<seg id="6">"a mother of two children, Jenny Davidson, who had been in business at the same time, said that after the mysterious woman had tried her underwear, she went on and left the business without buying anything."</seg>
<seg id="7">She said: "people could not believe what they saw.</seg>
<seg id="8">"standing in the middle of the sales area she took a pair of underpants from the outlay, pulled out her own tights and pants and tried them."</seg>
<seg id="9">"she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there, cheeky like Oskar."</seg>
<seg id="10">"everyone stared when they pulled out the underpants, which you obviously didn't like, as they put them back into the shelf."</seg>
<seg id="11">"she repeated the same thing with three more underpants, before she finally decided that she didn't like to dress again and went out."</seg>
<seg id="12">She didn't seem to disturb anyone watching - or thinking about the person who could possibly buy the underpants that she had tried.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Davidson, 33, who lives in Kent, said:" "how to think reluctantly that someone would take shelter with someone who had a different person and who were not washed."</seg>
<seg id="14">The incident happened on Tuesday afternoon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Mrs. Davidson added:" "as I received, the employees tried to pull the clothes out of the sale after they went - what's just as good."</seg>
<seg id="16">I would hate to go home with a new couple of underpants and find out that another woman had touched her and pulled out and she didn't get washed.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a speaker of Primark said:" "Primark is aware of the incident which took place on Tuesday August 9 at our branch in Folkstone."</seg>
<seg id="18">All products in question have been withdrawn from sale.</seg>

<seg id="2">"the world outside is a dangerous place, but this video by Dailymail.com could make it a bit safer for you."</seg>
<seg id="3">"we spoke to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you are approaching from the front or behind, this video will show you how to turn the skewer for your robber."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you are approached from behind, you should turn around as first, so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the cast line, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">"then hit him with his knee in the bar and twist, while the attacker curls before pain, the weapon out of his hands. hit him with the run into the face and move backwards while doing the weapon on him."</seg>
<seg id="8">"with attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the cast line, grab the weapon and twist it so that the attacker can't shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time shift the weight to the weapon and beat the Attacker on the chest, then twist the weapon out of its grip, before moving backwards and set the weapon on it."</seg>
<seg id="10">Sounds difficult?</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shuts his tongue to the dirtiest places in Europe for a travel guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and dignified case of a serious test - putting off some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk shook his course on a euro note, a handrail at Piccadilly Circus, a rinse button on a train toilet and a public phone in Russia to prove the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before removing each object, he used a luminometer to show himself and us what he is going to do."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results to light."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought to remove the rinse button of a draw shower that has already been used by thousands of others may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke to doctors and medical professionals about the promotion of intestinal bacteria and his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing left what he licked, more than a bad taste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">"Wright became known to test the resistance of his intestines, traveling through the world and eating odd things as well as wonderful things."</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public funds to railway stations to sinks of toilets, the task of the immune system definitely put under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film he said:" as a child I was relatively unconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and sludge water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was justified in any case."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">Its sample line showed a luminometer number of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the Luminometer number of freshly washed hands is less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian restroom that he refused to lick, after their Luminometer number was over 4000 units, while fresh washed hands have less than 60 units."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of milk products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "indicating the number of bacteria in different places, such as the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the film he says:" "that comes close to the worst thing I have gerocked in a toilet."</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing more mutated than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't dock here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in collaboration with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains both lactic acid bacteria and vitamin C and D to support the promotion of intestinal bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended with saying "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in gut health is becoming a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a greater context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we could provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I instructed him to lick, just like the disgusting Russian toilet that is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to get Ian to lick her and others where this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I am glad that we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio in 2015, 84 percent of all respondents reported lactic acid bacteria in particular with the well-being of stomach and intestines and 58 percent said they use at least occasional products containing lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asozial family left their social apartment after a delogierung with a loss of £50,000, because it had terrorized their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, the property owner shocked the property in an irreparable condition."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls showed plainly holes, wooden planks were torn, rubbish was scattered on the floor and graffiti was lubricated to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been resettled and it is believed that it is now living in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for the house management at Cornwall Housing, said that she feared that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for the people here and I think people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider since this estate is thought to be considered not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and their reputation is also known.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had joined, street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive screaming, quarrels and fluxes included."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skelby, 47, whose name was on the lease, got an arrangement for anti-social behaviour in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found"</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate, in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden floorboards were torn up"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly invoked the police</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing gifted her and her partner this week forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogization was cheered by lightened neighbors who said that their life was made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," They didn't care about anyone. "</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years beside them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we say the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We stood up because it was so quiet here - we are not used!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be nice."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager from Cornwall Housing, said that the family had agreed to cooperate with the local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house, to which the police was called at regular intervals, for 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="26">On the overgrown side of the community house trash and old toys were thrown down</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" it is a shame that the lessee agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and that of their family, as delogization is always the final step that Cornwall Housing is taking into consideration. "</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions needed to be horrible for their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work that my team, the police of Devon and Cornwall, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbors and the message communicates that anti-social behaviour is not tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress covered in one of the bedrooms of the house after delogizing on the ground</seg>
<seg id="33">Housekeeping workers will now have to sweep away garbage mountains that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police launched a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as balances, paraphernalia and cash in the amount of £1.700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skelby received a fine of money after being guilty of owning a drug of class B in commercial custody.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">"after having been homeless, it is assumed that Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many walls of the house were graffiti with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will deloge tenants who do not stick to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">Angela Crow was told by the police of Devon and Cornwall that the Delogierung is a clear warning to the other tenants who do not abide by the house rules.</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think that they can behave without self-reproaches, as well as those who have been harmed by such behavior," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="42">The police of Devon and Cornwall will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behavior that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="2">"Harry Reid, leader of the Democrats in the Senate, is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, will nominate the judge Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="3">The Republicans in the Senate have blocked Garlands's confirmation since his nomination by Barack Obama in March.</seg>
<seg id="4">The majority leader in Senate Mitch McConnell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the deceased judge in the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia.</seg>
<seg id="5">"on Thursday, Reid said during a telephone conference that he expected Clinton to choose Garland with a certain degree of certainty."</seg>
<seg id="6">A spokeswoman of Reid later said that he had not talked to Clinton whether she would nominate Garland and he speculated.</seg>
<seg id="7">He praised Garland and said Clinton's team would not worry about restlessness with a new candidate.</seg>
<seg id="8">Garland is the Supreme Court for the U.S. Court of Appeal for the District of Columbia.</seg>

<seg id="2">"whoever doesn't fit and praises Erdogan, sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen-nearby Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the short term, the Kurd municipality of Germany computes with tens of thousands of refugees fleeing from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, it could even be" some hundred thousand, "believes the chairman of the association Ali Toprak."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to the harsh protest of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan after the coup attempt, the Kurd community Germany expects a mass flight to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium-term with several hundred thousand policemen from Turkey in Germany, when the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," says the President of the Union Ali Toprak of the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had already overgrown Kurdish strongholds with impunity several months ago, 500,000 Kurds within Turkey were fleeing."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after putsch, there were still secular and oppositional ethnic Turks."</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they are further suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state that takes up refugees, produces refugees in their own country," said Toprak. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the chief of the association complained about the targeted resettlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"with this, Erdogan hopes to increase the exit pressure to the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have been eradicated or displaced in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a CDU member. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The chairman of the association called for the Federal Government to be "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany, too, a" witch hunt "against Erdogan critics takes place."</seg>
<seg id="16">I don't feel safe in Germany for the first time in recent months.</seg>
<seg id="17">The German branch of the Gülen movement also fears the flight of many Turks abroad.</seg>
<seg id="18">"more Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionists."</seg>
<seg id="19">The branding as a Gülen-follower destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who doesn't fit and praises Erdogan is sitting on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and Säkulars," said Ercan Karakoyun, Chairman of the Gülen-nearby Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as the newspaper reported on the numbers of the Federal Ministry of Interior, the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum seekers recognized by political persecution in Germany before the coup."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals won't get anything from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the Landtag.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in 2021, the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for stupid as yet it is not about: summer holidays, heat and day-day competition - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced by the election fighters, are on vacation."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers who are in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee are not the locals, so they are not allowed to choose the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="8">"there are practical problems: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, spread flyers and count votes in the end are only laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as of September 4, 2016, the election and last holiday day, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern has to pass the election campaign just barely by the people over themselves."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, must be afraid of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now clearly behind the CDU in surveys."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly newcomer AfD cuts off and what remains at the end of the coalition.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous electoral campaign, one sees from his big posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels across the country, distributes roses and chatters a little with the people, just as his legendary singer Harald Ringstorff had already done."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, Seelering has got cold feet and gives Chancellor Merkel the blame on the blossoming of the AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their refugee policy, their" "We create that" "accelerates the rise of the right-wing populists, which is now likely to cost him the beautiful ministry."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its Spitzenkandidaten, the Minister of the Interior Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when you make the right place for the wrong time at the right place."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has twice invited Chancellor Angela Merkel to large-scale explorations; Merkel's parliamentary group is located in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," said Vincent Kokert, Secretary General of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"but it's a pity, no one from other corners of Germany, to listen to Angela Merkel once."</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the north-east CDU largely waives the usual election campaigns at market places and in front of shopping centres with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"that, says Kokert, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union has also noted that in the country, it is crumbling the ground that it must be very strict to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: there is hardly any present in the sides of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU election fighter Kokert on his comrades is also self-exposing:" "you must go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden Weddings, every birthday party must be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because there is much on the game, Sellering has called his SPD to a particularly committed campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in surveys, the Socialists and Democrats lagged behind partners CDU (25) and just before the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election of 2011, the SPD had still won with 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Greens, a small party with seven percent in the polls, are likely to make the leap into the Landtag."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of summer poverty and largely relocate their campaign to the internet.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," is the president of the country Claudia Müller. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"otherwise, green election fighters embark on search for native vocal chests among the holidaymakers."</seg>
<seg id="35">"Silke Gajek, the top-candidate, curvy straight with a houseboat through the Mecklenburg lakes and finds it even beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="36">"your impression:" "electoral holidays in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern is not a punishment." ""</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 refurbishment: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which start at 5.30 in the morning and only end at about 8pm, there is all praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they did everything pretty zacky," says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station. "</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a Superteam.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is also no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site was scheduled to be relocated to the south at the end of the week, by the end of October."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the design of those responsible for the construction work is also commended, for example when it comes to the establishment of housing trips."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has been migrated to the south and the blockage of the Aspergstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the site is relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now drive from Ofterdingen out of the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">The departure from the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable complaints," says the Deputy Chief Executive Officer Florian King, responsible for the management of the refurbishment. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachelstraße, Steinlachstraße, Hafnerstraße and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise because many Schleichwege were seeking and more familiar with their Navi than the signposting."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to a franchise of some trucks in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">"since the speed limits were not complied with, the community encouraged the measuring vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," says King, who made himself a spot on the spot. "</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have already been fired.</seg>
<seg id="18">The fastest was on the way with 77 hourly kilometres in the Tempo-30-Zone.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, it has become quieter."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the business people at the B 27 it is only a small consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Businessmen don't like to look into the maps.</seg>
<seg id="22">"but the fact that the B 27 refurbishment has led to sales breakdowns, everyone you ask will let you look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and some less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the" end customer "are produced for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"even at the dealership in Maier Thomas Sulz speaks of a" "most slight drop", "but also admits that, of course," "the running exploration is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the bars along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J. Albert Göhner, owner of the Steakhouse, formerly crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential threatening.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants have hit it" hard. ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"the customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil."</seg>
<seg id="31">We must be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in terms of sales revenues, he goes to" far more than 50 percent. ""</seg>
<seg id="33">The road marking had its operation "thrown back for two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He had to leave half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have reacted differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, President Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request from Göhner if there could be a financial compensation, otherwise the restaurant would benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27. now, they must also bear the disadvantages that arise from the renovation."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where such a generous deal has been handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in all suits, Göhner is sure that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, family business has been here since 1715, and refers to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regulars now look less frequently due to the complicated traffic guidance, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you can't drive, it is also somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="42">"however, Göhner has no doubts about that his family-clientele is coming back to the end of the renovation work."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and avian flu, Göhner thinks the impact of the B 27 construction works on his clientele for the biggest crisis that has experienced its host in its long-term history."</seg>
<seg id="44">"six months of construction work, this is already brutal."</seg>

<seg id="12">But these are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"a lot is already known, announced, announced, that a new security authority should take care of the jaws of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">Nor is the fact that Germany has to implement several EU regulations on passenger data and arms law.</seg>
<seg id="15">"" "the call for more video surveillance and personnel for the security authorities is not surprising."</seg>

<seg id="17">"these will be difficult points for the SPD," "admits the CDU man."</seg>
<seg id="18">"he still believes this to be reasonable and does not claim anything, which is not a chance for the coalition partner anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">A few new ideas will be presented de Maizière as well.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partially in themselves: he is planning quick practices for deportations and more possibilities for the incarceration of people from deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees that are targeted specifically in the country should check their smartphones in advance and disclose social media accounts for a safety review.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the case of tolerations for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some even worse than until now - about such crimes that commit crimes or deliberately throw away their papers in order to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are political and legal.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some of them are still unplayable and are open to questions.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and at some point - in the unequal treatment of patients, for example, the question arises: what does this have to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the subjects of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be said that the assassins of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, in view of the high number of refugees, many people were worried about security."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that deeply occupied the people could not be clenched, even in election times."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has shifted enormously into the focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only the attacks in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Wuerzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are elections."</seg>
<seg id="35">"for this reason, the Union and the SPD are therefore increasingly in position on the subject of internal security."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, there was a high level between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was only a horrendous argument about the equipment of the Federal Police, then about a security-policy-collection of some Unions Interior Minister, in which the departments also call for a burka ban and a return from the dual citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also tedious for conciliatory tones.</seg>
<seg id="39">He doesn't stop from a withdrawal from the double-pass.</seg>
<seg id="40">We have ended the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To reopen it is not sensible.</seg>

<seg id="43">"whether its own package is constitutional at all corners and whether it is" "reasonable" "for the coalition partner, must first show itself."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who buys records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely middle-aged men love records.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you make a comment to see it under the pseudonym non-allotomy male middle age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the reemergence of records is not to be attributed to a boom in Millennials, which would like to welcome the news of physical objects, but to midlife nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresighted at the age of 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely group of buyers."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a hordes by hobbysers - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers have retained their feelings rather for themselves (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending themselves time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog is a news report on television, the camera would follow me while I run in the middle of a busy road in Soho, bear a modest gray suit and graze wild before I stand, keep my hands and let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">So let's take a look at it.</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Soho is slowly losing its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings where once independent sellers were located - there is still a handful of fantastic plate specialist stores."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to switch the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to different men in such shops and try to assess their age and minds through observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Stuart from Glasgow, 55, to whom I am from Sister Ray (Number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) to Reckless Records (Number of data: eight men of middle age, a woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the few hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, do I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have approximately 3,000 or 4,000 records."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these gramophone records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by email, I did not follow him at home), dress the walls of his room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his disposable income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford, when she appeared and again buy items he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late sixties, early 70's, that appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I thought was a bit too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy plates are more introverted and like to spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink too much. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people who are influenced by the media pump, people who have heard about the comeback and are trying to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have conducted, people usually have gotten out of their collection so as to get rid of their collection in 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their plates to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their plates again," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom to followers of the plate revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">It takes only a few seconds in a business like Phonica to realize that record stores offer a calming community of like-minded people.</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers hit the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw to the stability of familiar vinyl covers, from objects that evoke happy memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think sometimes it can be the colt of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," "says Wez."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is like a collector and I think it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It's a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like her social workers!" "a worker flows from a stack."</seg>
<seg id="35">A survey by ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of people who bought a record last month have not yet listened to them.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, while 7% of those who buy a record don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very concerned, while browsing through a pile of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of data: three middle aged men), has noticed a" trophy aspect "of the Revivals."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here just recently and said:" I don't have record players, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead soundboard so I can put them into the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productive, less music-class."</seg>
<seg id="42">"we have people who say," "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older people who only slowly get into it."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has devoted almost a whole floor to the records, has a blower audience when I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around the 70, tourists who make photos, teenage and middle-aged teenagers."</seg>
<seg id="46">"even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts latest synthesize and sex-packed pop instead of experimental jazz groans out of the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among customers."</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but naïve psychic trauma is hard to determine if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, runs around the store for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">It rather makes a window-bumble as a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, so collecting plates is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in a different way, but the beauty of plates is..." it drives off with a loving sigh. "</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of record enthusiasts: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I'm giving the impression to mutate the jeans pants, I watch a group of young teenage girls who group for a moment around Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter decide to buy a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of records of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one sees them - perhaps because they are purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that any attraction for these items would mean more money for the industry and some customers could send to the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, which has more time and money than others, is also the one that is most suitable for luxury items such as plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research showed that the results of YouGov vote, they leave, at least in record shops in Soho, the large number of female collectors, who exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they do not spend their Thursday morning with security with the strolling through record stores of Berwick Street and the leaves through sheets, while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old wrong moderator who raises nothing of middle-aged males over the shoulders."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court rejected a proposal by the authorities in Calais, dozens of temporary businesses and restaurants in the jungle of Calais, in which thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a court hearing this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorized to sell 72 temporary businesses in which individuals within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to Energydrinks, sell, offer hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Prefecture of Calais argued that these places were to be demolished, because they would represent a parallel economy, out of which no taxes would be paid, and that would be a risk of fire and security."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups shared the court that shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported association and other groups would not provide enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also suggested that the provisional businesses and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary businesses, but admitted that the concerns of the prefecture of Calais were" absolutely understandable. ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that food stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than just feeding people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer peaceful meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the rainfall was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is commonly used and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of vulnerable, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">"more than 170,000 people signed the petition to preserve the kids' café."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian, it was said that" closure "would be a catastrophe for these children, of which the youngest eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Friday, the two relief organisations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated that the number of people who live in the jungle of the jungle has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - after a steep increase in newcomers during the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Britain's impressive performance at 7-er Rugby came to an abrupt halt in the final hurdle in the form of Fijis, when they were defeated in Rio de Janeiro with a result of 43-7 at the Deodoro Stadium."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Fiji granted a master class in handling, side steppes, back, line run and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal of any colour."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the defeat was missed by the not too bad consolation prize of the silver medal - Britain's fourth on that day - and they could be quite proud of their efforts in this tournament, in which they beat New Zealand, Argentina and South Africa."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the clear defeat of the Boks, 7-5 in the semifinals on the same day could fall back on them in the final."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but regardless of this, Fiji would have defeated a 15-man team in this form."</seg>
<seg id="7">"it could be a consolation for GB - but it will probably not - that at least a Brite will have a gold medal around his neck tomorrow: Fijis head coach Ben Ryan, the former head of England from Wimbledon."</seg>
<seg id="8">GB had a difficult path behind it.</seg>
<seg id="9">Eight years ago she lost every game at the Adelaide Sevens.</seg>
<seg id="10">Here they lost only one.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this flap will hurt, but progress is amazing."</seg>
<seg id="12">Fiji began wonderful and caused the attacks of GBs to bounce out of fun.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it felt for Captain Tom Mitchell and Co., as if one would run in driving buses. the World Series winners went 5-0 upwards, when Osea Kolinisau froze in the corner."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with just four minutes of playing time, Jerry Tuwai added another attack from the right corner that he turned around."</seg>
<seg id="15">12-0 and GB hardly touched the ball.</seg>
<seg id="16">"a protracted Tackle of Mitchell stopped the mountain of guy Leone Nakarawa a third goal, but it only stopped Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in the seventh minute, the jasa Veremalua took a touch down in the right corner and it was 0-17 for GB."</seg>
<seg id="18">Nakarawa added a new song since the restart and there was still over a minute playing time... in the first half.</seg>
<seg id="19">Vatemo Ravouvou presumes through other weak tacklings of the GB team and stormed up to the line to make a gate.</seg>
<seg id="20">The conversion brought a 29-0 to the break.</seg>
<seg id="21">"it is as if Fiji had been born to play the 7, while GB is still being forgotten."</seg>
<seg id="22">This is how it is.</seg>
<seg id="23">"GB led basic changes to the half-time and closed the fijian gap... for all four minutes, which was good for the ratios of the first half-time until Joshua passed Tuisova after a brilliant Interplay of Fiji."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Dan Norton started an attempt for GB, made a touch down in the left corner for a 36-7, but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Pacific, whose fans sang, swung flags and danced on the tribune."</seg>
<seg id="25">It was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fijis.</seg>
<seg id="26">Mata Viliame put the icing on the cake with another attempt in the last few seconds.</seg>

<seg id="3">"from the first stroke to the last, 220 hard hieve who enter history, Helen Glover and Heather Stanning took an additional meaning in their golden moment at the Estacio da Lagoa."</seg>
<seg id="4">"even if they were only the two who sat at the helm, there were three voices in the boat. the echo of the trainer Robin Williams, was all present when they rowed to the second Olympiagold in Zweibrücken without a control woman, the first women in the history of British sports who put on such a scale."</seg>
<seg id="5">"her dominance was absolutely, after all her 39.ter untroubled use, which is also unparalleled."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant female athletes, who glide across the surface with the elegance of swans, which is not reflected in the type of triumphal march."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind every gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers to contribute to the incremental progress that make the difference, and no one knows if he would survive this day at all when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he risked."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not, it spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty bad situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It does not change the outlook.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could start treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum, if under such circumstances it is the right term."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better again soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was hospitalized and ran around at the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said some steps would be enough."</seg>
<seg id="18">This is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the rowing in itself is already a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of victory their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a busy morning talking with it more than usual, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, which was a Captain in the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said" "I was an emotional wreck this week. this is perhaps something extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it only repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin, we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world."</seg>

<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have lost no race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a hard rhythm with which their opponents could not keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when teams from New Zealand and Denmark started to catch up, panning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were very caught at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not out to make something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"today we didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race what we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about its future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover must appear next week on a wedding, her own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>

<seg id="37">I didn't want to say that it was my last race.</seg>

<seg id="1">Steel - A light look for German steel industry</seg>
<seg id="2">The crisis-packed and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in millions of millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">"financial burdens, which the industry threatened from green electricity subsidies, are from the table."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains in the release of the Renewable Energy Transition in the existing plants for the so-called self-current production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"at first, the European Commission had planned to ask the steel manufacturers to use the gas from blast furnace to generate electricity for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry threatened additional costs of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">Gabriel said the WAZ: there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission after talks with Commissioner Margrethe Vestager.</seg>
<seg id="9">"only when the generators are replaced in the steel works, an EEG levy of 20 percent is applicable."</seg>
<seg id="10">But also this is not raised in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">The IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission for self-electricity production.</seg>
<seg id="12">"as a result, the status quo of the previous regulation will be largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful efforts of Gabriel for the steel industry are of particular importance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our campaign 'Steel is Future', this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"others must follow." ""</seg>
<seg id="16">"" "climate and employment targets must also be considered in the reform of emissions trading targets," "said IG Metall-CEO Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt."</seg>
<seg id="17">"since the financial crisis in 2008, the steel industry has suffered under overcapacity and considerable price pressure."</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation continued to aggravate as the world's largest producer in China cast iron on the global market due to the weakening domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers shed price dumping Chinese steel corporations.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has become somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel effects, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened up."</seg>
<seg id="22">What is unclear is how sustainable the price-up is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp remained cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, prices would have stagnated."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry reacts to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"finally, ThyssenKrupp did not want to close the closure of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the end of 2015, about 8,000 people were employed in the German steel industry."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, the German steel producers remain cautious despite rising prices and increasing orders."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent less crude steel than in the previous year's month, as Steel Division reported on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the set amount returned to the second month in a row."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since the beginning of the year, production has been around two percent below the previous year's figure."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing is good for seniors"</seg>
<seg id="2">"singing Ursel Kipp has accompanied her whole life: as a young girl she was in school choir, in the Lehramt study she took the subject of music, and today the 78-year-old sings in an elderly choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"singing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and overall alive, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and her mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"because singing is a great hobby for seniors, Erhard Hackler says of the German Senior League."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share the joy of music with like-minded people, describes Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="8">Through regular meetings seniors can socialize and cultivate social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">"because often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience has also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to speak and organize, to be able to rely on the others and to learn from each other, a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be tiring in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">"for doing so, seniors train a deep and controlled breathing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"who regularly calls on his lungs, is not so fast in everyday life from the puste."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to getting the sound of the voice at the age, singing is an optimal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in older people, singing has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the Federal Labour Association of senior citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations the common singing had a much higher value, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and in leisure time, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observes that singing or listening to songs in older people awakens many memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">"with lyrics and especially melodies, even people with dementia suffer from long past events."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, a particular performance is required to the head, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time focusing on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapting to the other singers, this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"especially older people, who live alone, practice not only to concentrate on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition that is experienced by singing in the choir, Hackler says."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great compliment.</seg>
<seg id="24">Self-esteem is also growing through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"showing yourself: if I practise for something long, I will improve and grow beyond myself - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"who wants to try a new hobby should not hesitate, even if he thinks he has little talent, Lenz advises."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - at 50 singing people, who can hear when a sound goes beside it?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"if you are looking for the right offer, seniors have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone sings from the circle of acquaintances in a seniors' choir, one can easily connect."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can contact the church or church leader directly.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found on the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you don't have access to the internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet search."</seg>
<seg id="35">"who wants to sing, should necessarily join a chorus, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does well and has something liberating - that is true for any age.</seg>

<seg id="2">Biologists have investigated in Hanover what effect the sleep of cat babies has on adult animals.</seg>
<seg id="3">"to their surprise, the mistrust also didn't let the males get cold - however they always behaved the same in contrast to the females."</seg>
<seg id="4">Female cats can recognize the degree of naturalness of cat babies at the mistrust of the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="5">"they respond ten percent faster to bisons of kittens who are in great distress, as scientists from the Veterinary Medical School and the Hannover Medical School (MHH) found out."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Kater also responds to the calls of kittens, but always the same."</seg>
<seg id="7">"apparently, the acoustic differences between mistrust of less and strongly aroused young animals are either not perceptible or not of significance for the males," "said the biologist Wiebke Konerding of the MHH."</seg>
<seg id="8">She is the author of the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous study, the research team had already found out that the duration and pitch of the kittens are different with the urgency of their dependency."</seg>
<seg id="10">Altogether nine adult males and eight female kittens were observed from the animal husbandry of the MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">They were pre-played for a pack of small children who were taken out of the throw box for three minutes and separated from mother and siblings.</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with screams of stronger excited kittens, which were raised in addition."</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers consider their results to be meaningful despite the small sample.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who had no offspring, reacted to the screams," Konerding said. "</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned up faster to the speaker when this calls of the very excited kittens played.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be innate or develop with sexual maturity.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a surprise was that the males have reacted at all," "said the biologist."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the past, scientists have already studied the reactions of women and men to baby sounds."</seg>

<seg id="4">They planned their home journey at the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="5">"whether from the other explosions on the holiday island Phuket as well as in the southern cities Surat Thani, Phang Nga, Trang and Chumphon, also Austrian citizens are affected, is still unclear."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities, such as Schnöll."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Hua Hin, located about 200 kilometres south of the capital Bangkok, were first exploded on Thursday evening in a quarter of two bombs."</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to the police, a Thai police were killed and about 20 people were injured, including the Austrian, three Germans, three Dutch and three Italians."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on Friday morning two explosives went up, and a further human being killed by the authorities."</seg>
<seg id="10">"also from Phuket, a bomb explosion was reported in the morning."</seg>
<seg id="11">"during the detonation close to the popular seaside resort of Patong, a taxi driver was injured after police information."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in Surat Thani on the south-east coast of the country, a further bomb exploded, killing an urban employee."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the authorities, the explosive device had gone into the air in a flower bed in front of the precinct of the coastal police."</seg>
<seg id="14">"after all, detonations in Phang Nga and Trang on the south-west coast and in Chumphon at the south-eastern coast called for several wounded."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from a connection with the explosions in Hua Hin, it was said."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the bombings bear the same signature," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that this is a co-ordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to speak of possible motives, but it is probably the deeds of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the attacks, Thai media also wanted to see a pattern that is typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not related to the Islamist uprising movement or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a spokesman in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"rather, one assumes that the bombs were laid by opponents of the ruling military junta."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities would have kept secret references to upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">It is still unclear which group is behind the attacks.</seg>
<seg id="25">"police instructed their officials throughout the country to enhance security for important government buildings as well as airports, train stations, tourist attractions, restaurants and entertainment districts."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in Thailand, there are always smaller bomb attacks, but mostly they do not judge themselves against tourists."</seg>
<seg id="27">Hua Hin is a palace which was used for years by Thailands king Bhumibol Adulyadej.</seg>
<seg id="28">"following the recent bomb explosions, the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs recommends that the Thai security authorities fail to follow the instructions of Thai security authorities."</seg>
<seg id="29">"high security risk (security level 3) applies to the provinces of Narathiwat, Yala, Pattani and Songhkla as well as Preah Vihear and its environs."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after confrontations between security forces and Muslim populations, there is no need for travelling to these provinces."</seg>
<seg id="31">Increased safety risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday took place a few days after a controversial referendum on a Constitution issued by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This admits great influence to the military during the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said the bombs were an attempt to instigate chaos, while the country in the direction of stability, an improvement in economic conditions and tourism."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the military junta, which had seized power in 2014 after a period of bloody unrest, has benefitted itself to have brought the kingdom back to stability and order."</seg>

<seg id="7">"it turns against" "multikulti-delusion", "" "uncontrolled mass immigration" "and the" "loss of one's own identity by alienation." ""</seg>
<seg id="8">"constitutional objectors in nine federal states - Bremen, Bavaria, Hessen, Berlin, Baden-Württemberg, NRW, Lower Saxony, Saxony and Thuringia - observe the" identities. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that his authority was closely coordinated with the state offices in the decision.</seg>
<seg id="10">"groups like the 'Identity Movement' try to pick up their target group where it stands," "said the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in general, extremists try to address them with a youthful language, often with poppy music."</seg>
<seg id="12">These are Islamists as well as right-wing extremists.</seg>
<seg id="13">This is no publicity for one's own thing.</seg>
<seg id="14">Propaganda should appeal to people emotionally.</seg>
<seg id="15">Young people are particularly vulnerable.</seg>
<seg id="16">This is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="17">"last but not least, there have been reports of contacts from the" "Identity" "to AfD politicians from several German states."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Maate said, he did not have any knowledge."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for the constitutional protection, potential contacts of this kind are only relevant at some point."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it depends on whether the respective party - in this case, the AfD - by certain individuals who are extremist, changes their direction and becomes so extremist."</seg>
<seg id="21">The decisive factor is whether such persons have a controlling influence on the party.</seg>
<seg id="22">This is not recognizable.</seg>
<seg id="23">"in view of the significant increase in legal criminates and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shelters, Maattendate said he would not speak of new rightist terrorism in this regard."</seg>
<seg id="24">But in recent years we have found that there can be law-terrorism structures.</seg>
<seg id="25">There was the group 'Old School Society' or the Freital group.</seg>
<seg id="26">"it may well be that other rightist groups or small groups form themselves, who plan attacks against asylum seekers, against refugee shelters or attacks from other right-wing extremist motives."</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, a nationwide or Europe-wide management of legal terrorism is not recognizable."</seg>
<seg id="28">The previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks.</seg>
<seg id="29">Worried about that many attacks came to the account of people who did not appear before in the right scene.</seg>
<seg id="30">That is the worrying.</seg>
<seg id="31">"many of the crimes suspect in attacks on asylum are not known before as criminals, politically motivated offenders or supporters of the right scene."</seg>
<seg id="32">"so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing at all with right-wing extremists, who might have been politically indifferent or elected for example CDU, SPD or left, who, however, have radicalised themselves by right-wing extremist sentiments."</seg>

<seg id="2">The Olympic Games or World Records will not always determine the headlines of the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the courageous performance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics Center, the easily overweight swimmers from Ethiopia are so slow that it was temporarily out of sight in the TV pictures."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was selected.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the social networks, Habte became a viral internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and reserved the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but it was rather his not just sporty figure, which attracted the attention of international media."</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympic Games?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming club.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming known in underrepresented countries.</seg>
<seg id="12">"as most athletes run in Ethiopia, Habte just wanted to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">The first nicknames quickly made the lap.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media called it as "roubles of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"based on a" prosperity ball, "the English tabloid" The Sun "with" Dad Bod "was funny about him."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he struck only with a minute and almost five seconds over the 100 meters freestyle, played no role."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" were also drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the Olympic Games 2000 in Sydney, Eric Moussambani took care of media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">The appearance of the buoyancy chamber from Equatorial Guinea was unforgettable when he had to stand alone in a run of over 100 metres of free style.</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically Moussambani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The 22-year-old learned to swim only eight months before the Olympic Games and had never had such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">"the fees per cubic metre of wastewater amount to 2.10 euros as of 1 October 2016 for the area of the sewage plant Neudorf / Reuth / Welleg 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros. for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 Euro (up to now 2.26 euros) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (up to now 2.18 Euro)."</seg>
<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the sewage charges will increase later than once again if appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after excessive calculation, the wastewater price in Azendorf will then be 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the budget by the Land Council of Kulmbach was ascertained that subcoverings would run for these wastewater facilities."</seg>
<seg id="5">"due to legal foundations, the market of Kasendorf was obliged to operate the facilities in a cost-effective manner."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of 1 October 2016, citizens and trade and industrial companies from Welleg, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to intervene more deeply in the wallet."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Chairman of the Board of Directors, Herbert Schmidt presented to the committee, a re-calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercoverings from the previous calculation period may also be compensated."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the serious fee increases were based on Schmidt, making it possible for all three wastewater facilities to operate relatively small facilities with a very low sewerage, between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"due to the low distribution basis, for example, expenses for necessary repairs would have a serious impact on several thousand euros."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the sewage system in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, in the past period of calculation in all three systems, not least due to their age renovation and repair expenses have fallen into a considerable extent."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf was almost 30 years old, the plants for Welleg, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that in the sewage plant Azendorf the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced due to a damage.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after nearly 20 years of operation, the first sewage sludge had to be disposed of, the sewage sludge was disposed of and an additional ventilation facility to be installed in order to comply with the water regulations in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">Schmidt: "these extraordinary expenses came with the continued support and maintenance costs that have to be taken into account in the new calculation period.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were still clearly below the current level during the previous calculation in 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">Stone houses made it clear that in the case of low sewerage in the three facilities the expenses for operation and maintenance are "fully reflected."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in doing so, Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs remained spared in the past 20 years."</seg>

<seg id="10">"news and outrage have been widely distributed on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat shared that it deactivated the feature."</seg>

<seg id="1">"military leadership falsifies ISIS intelligence information, establishes Committee of Congress"</seg>
<seg id="2">"the military personnel of the United States Central Command have changed intelligence information to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, as the actual conditions on the ground would have allowed, an investigation committee of the congress reported in a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the preliminary report, created by a Task Force of the Republican members of the army committees, intelligence services and military budget comitters, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Intelligence analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"central Command, short Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida, which controls American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence information, which were typically taken off by high-ranking Centcom commanders, posted a positive image of the American efforts against terrorism as the actual conditions on site had allowed and were consistently positive as analysis of other intelligence services," a newspaper article cited the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer when bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," stated Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The management errors in the Centcom range to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report shows detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of American efforts in training the Iraqi armed forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama gave instructions to change the reports, it shows how analysts faced the pressure from their superiors to draw an optimistic view of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before Congress were clearly more positive than it did to the facts," said the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, a CentCom member publicly announced that a military reconquest of Mossuls could begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." "said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement."</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the Central Command points changed the intelligence reports to play down the danger of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force to life after it was assigned that analysts were worried about manipulation of reports on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">The report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed findings while the investigations will continue.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, there are further investigations carried out by the Centcom reports by the Ministry of Defence of the Ministry of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">"on Thursday, democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings, which coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years 2014 and 2015, Centcom created an excessively restricted process for the creation of intelligence assessments on ISIL and the Iraqi security services," announced the highest-ranking democrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives, B. Schiff, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, so Mr. Schiff," delayed the release of intelligence reports, "compensated the morals among analysts and" gave too little space for dissenting opinion. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats stated that there was no evidence of a White House intervention in the Centcom analyst with regard to a "certain political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the investigation of the Congress were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon's general inspector who received complaints from Centcom Analyst."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman for the Pentagon, stated in a statement that the Ministry of Defense would not comment on any reports of the Congress, while the investigation of the general inspector was still ongoing."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also stated that" "experts sometimes have divergent opinions on the interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the Ministry of Defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations carried out repercussions on the issue of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is meanwhile made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defence).</seg>
<seg id="27">"the accusations of last year have raised the question of what President Obama can rely on the Central Command for honest assessments of military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism concerning the secret information about the Islamic State recalled the divisions of more than ten years ago, when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, thought about how the former government under George W. Bush saw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against current reporting on the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team headed by Mr. Hooker stated that contrary to the statements made by the government, air strikes against the refineries held by the Islamic State would have no significant impact on the financial situation of the terrorist group, since these provisional refineries would have put in operation to sell oil on the black market."</seg>

<seg id="1">"the US gains fourth match in the field-hockey of women, a showdown with Great Britain stands before"</seg>
<seg id="2">"one day after having shot three gates during a 6-1 victory over Japan, Katie Bam also made the first two gates for the American field hockey team of women in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3-0."</seg>
<seg id="3">"five goals in two games should actually represent a memorable performance, but Bam (27) said she could not remember that ever done."</seg>
<seg id="4">"I have no idea." she said.</seg>
<seg id="5">I don't belong to the people who keep their doors in memory.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, she knows: the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Briton in the first place, who remain undefeated after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final round of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarterfinals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first part will be a little bit longer from the strong Dutch woman who will guide the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game starts on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising vortex through their success story, four years after they landed at the last London Games at the last of 12 places."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania and had the first time with three years a Hockey Macket in his hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became the national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">She missed the Olympics in 2008 because she could not qualify for the cadre.</seg>
<seg id="14">"then came the year 2012, in which for her and her team everything went wrong."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, became trainer of the National Team and thus began to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," said Bam. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the work place in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to pull the rudder around completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a back-handle from the local area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India was gone into the game without victory in the tournament, but the team showed up surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she completed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the middle and plunged the ball into the gate around the Americans to get a 2-0 lead."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of the whole tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">It has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the Rage of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, however late it is also, it is the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are constantly and inescapable, a rapid season between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">It is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning stick that is handed over by the wristband to the swimmers to the triathlete.</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour in the waiting queue in the coffee shop without hearing about Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time at the Olympic Games and a womens swarm with dimples, could well have been among those familiar names sent to Prime Time by sponsors and well-being TV ads, if he were a swimmers, gymnasts or even fencers."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines tournament."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate any event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the center, partly in the shadow are the sports which are not universally recognized: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breast-swimming and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should modest enough arguments for my particular darling, let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline has been an olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it became so sparse for the last 16 years that many who I had questioned weren't aware that there is an Olympic athlete at all."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to compete, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampolines and had had an athlete until 2012, who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share prices for the men and the Chinese and Canadians for sharing women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on the trampoline has a certain exterior charme, partly because it sounds suitable for the unenlightened ear for a clownal school as the one for the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">It has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never ending cheapy - but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving that combines two sports that essentially unites it.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" trampoline "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means so much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"emerging victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and have to land a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land on their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to official Olympic programme, they are rated according to performance, degree of difficulty and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"thirty-two athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women, will compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"in their quest for gold medal-fans must go further, faster, up and over, sometimes to the finish, sometimes up and back, upwards and downwards at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they are not only hunting the finish line or the starting wall, but also another highlight in the television broadcast: the world or the Olympiary."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal oriented striving is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it's enough to stir even a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it's also what I feel as tiring when watching these games.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a breathing break.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightlessly like an astronaut, goes upwards, then downwards, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"also here there is a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves in the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition at the Olympic Games can only be.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the qualification and final rounds of the women will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the end-hours as part of an afternoon block on both days starting at 2pm.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the middle of the Olympia-Mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is probably overlooked in the general tumult."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by angling and the objectivity of male athletes, according to The Wall Street Journal, Mr Dooley expects his new fan community."</seg>

<seg id="1">"a generation protests" in Ethiopia, Long an ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">"demonstrators, demanding political changes in Ethiopia, met the government's violent resistance."</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say that tens of protesters were killed during clashes with the police at gunmen.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just going to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of Africa's most stable countries, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months, protests shook the country against the government and expanded into more and more territories."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was ruthless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that police officers shot and killed dozens of unarmed demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="11">"circulating videos about the protests, which are probably from the last or beginning of this year, show how security people strike young people with sticks while they were forced to make a hand stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The head of the UN Human Rights Authority is now calling for an in-depth investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it was always difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa of the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">Ethiopia is the most populated country in Africa after Nigeria and its stability is estimated by the West.</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terror across the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if ever, get so much Western aid."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a considerable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the roads are usually quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"even if Ethiopia was anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have continuously led the repression by the government - the opposition in the country was restricted, although dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent into exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and these don't have any other options except to protest, it breaks out," said Seyoum Teshome, a lecturer in central Ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">The entire youth protests.</seg>
<seg id="24">One generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding power of the ruling coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a far-reaching vote last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 percent of parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time tensions along the border to Eritrea rise; a struggle for this shaky, controversial line challenged hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">Analysts fear that separatists such as the Oromo-Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of the Ogaden have been forced to use turmoil and arm themselves again in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness gradually explode under the surface.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first seems harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media since cheaper smartphones have become more and more popular and the Internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government blocks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially for protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they are."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians stated that they were thus gathered to protest.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amresas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amresas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons the Amresas, who come from aedics predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy while they exploited the Oromos, many of whom are Muslims and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this too is changing.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are going to coordinate under a screen," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The biggest protests took place in areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amresas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is dominated by members of the ethnic group of Tigray, which account for about 6 per cent of the population and are dominant in the military, secret services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for the unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, had been on Ethiopian Prime Minister until his death for 17 years until his death in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was seen as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the present regime lacks this basic skill," said Mr Abdi, a conflict analyst. "</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailanariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take the position of Mr. Meles."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tiger region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the trust of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands of elections were protesting, apparently false by the government and subsequently stolen by the government."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the ensuing raids, many protesters were killed, even if there were less than in the last months and this time of rest went by relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"development experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal grievance of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it assumes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month protesters in Gondar, an amharlian town, attacked by Tigray, and the hatred of the Tigray is becoming more and more common in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflights over the neighboring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, he does not want his ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr Abdi, "is a very thin tightrope walk."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his claim Obama has founded ISIS "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"on Friday Donald J. Trump tried to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign by attacking his multiple repeated assertion, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the" founders "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not seriously meant."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification sheds new questions on the communication skills of Republican presidential candidate if he is able to communicate clearly and comprehensively with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his comrades who try to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position of explaining statements which he could not have meant."</seg>
<seg id="5">"having made the announcement at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump insisted on Thursday's claim and insisted on interviews that he really did not intend to suggest that the President and Mrs. Clinton had created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump told him that he was sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the tweet was the opposite to the previous day, on which Mr. Trump had said in a series of interviews, he meant the accusation completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when the conservative radio commentator Hugh Hewitt wanted to help Mr. Trump to weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate wanted nothing to know about it."</seg>
<seg id="9">The last storm of criticism will crash upon Mr. Trump as he tried to steer the focus of his campaign on the economic situation due to falling demand.</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton talked about the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">"on Friday, Mr. Trump tried to return to this subject again."</seg>
<seg id="12">"commenting on Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's proposals would lead to higher taxes and that he found their speech bored."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians were to hack Mrs. Clinton's emails, but he later declared" "Of course, I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to recruit as needed.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are absorbed by his fans, how they arrive and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction expires." "said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates."</seg>
<seg id="17">"however, I think he is clever enough to hold his statements vage enough so that they can be interpreted in a variety of ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential election, Mr. Trump has adopted an even better tone, since its survey values have gone further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey of NBC / Wall Street Journal / Marist, which was published on Friday, showed a leading edge in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump has generally tried not to apologize for his provocative statements, he often accuses his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humour."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he is intensifying the focus of attention in the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trumps most prominent intercessors, had a great effort to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview of Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I think what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr Giuliani said to Mr. Giuliani about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements, whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama IS an almost unknown, small organization, he called them hulls, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans are trying to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as Secretary of State, allowed ISIS to spread out to get aggressive under control of the situation in the Middle East."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the election events held in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of lying around on each of his words and preoccupied against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the poor, miserable" television experts who try to understand him and said, "You can't!." "</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the democrats mocked Mr. Trump's apology as only another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," said Jane Ziegelman. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," "It was also a message to the Americans how to eat them."</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COEs Last book" Chop Suez "was the Chinese kitchen in the USA, while Ziegelman told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from the food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," An ongoing meal, "which will appear on Tuesday in Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity, when they met with a reporter at the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, snappy snack in the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the stock market crash in 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture ate."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered Hackfry, this found the pair suitable for a discussion about the food in the era of Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Ziegelman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there were peanut bread, liver cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and a little cheap that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts that they serve them as a dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have been laid in the stomach as lead," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression, the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-you-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"teams of women cooked for male rims and it was served fresh baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to starving Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "traces the roads with which the country was going to be no longer the land of land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when the food for the Americans became a central, tense theme," Coe begged why he and his wife wanted to write about it. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was just as tense: mysterious food such as breads and casseroles became a staple food, the casserole itself as a" wonderful way of reproducing food residues, "as chefs could hide unappetizing ingredients under a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the center of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"strange mixtures have been tried, since a low-calorie and nutritious satisfaction has priority over taste or even healthy kitchen common sense."</seg>
<seg id="27">"during her research for the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish from this period, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>
<seg id="28">"it was not a popular addition to lunch," says Coe. "</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-haie usually comes to the surface only in winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to go back to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats with over 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - to this day.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland has only 150 years of offspring.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Greenland shark floats along the ground of the North Atlantic, in an hour it is just 1,220 metres far."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it arrives, the five meter long animal accelerates to a satin 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterised by slowness, seems to be a recipe for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the scientific journal Science at least from a Greenland shark who could be 392 years old.</seg>
<seg id="11">"insanity," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max Planck Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"although the evolutionary biologist predicted long ago, Greenland sharks would become stony."</seg>
<seg id="13">Only the evidence was missing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland sharks are difficult to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the Grönlandhaie's lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="17">"her slow-turpentine measure, as she offered six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">They may chase dormant animals or patrol at the bottom of the ice cream and seek cadaver looking from higher water layers down.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland sharks which fishermen between 2010 and 2013 hollowed out from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depth of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 cm long, while the largest 502 centimetre measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analyzed the lens core of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is created already before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained in it are later no longer renewed."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had notably much carbon-14 in the lens core.</seg>
<seg id="25">"their birth should therefore be after the early 1960s, when nuclear weapons try to tow greater amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third-smallest animal with 220 centimeters in length, the lens nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small excess of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons attempt, so it is likely to have celebrated its 50th birthday during its investigation in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland-arks, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 volumes in its lentil nucleus, which arises through cosmic rays in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the Carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimetres long Greenland shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark with 502 centimeters might be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">Now the researchers were able to assign an age to the length.</seg>
<seg id="31">"because one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined with 156 years, Greenland-haie with the multiplication obviously allow at least one and a half centuries of time."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be a world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">"that such methusals live above all in icy waters, is no coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Grönlandwal, whose speck on the neck put a 120-year-old harpoon top, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the living animals often runs on spares."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slower.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very big."</seg>
<seg id="38">The volume grows much faster than its surface by which the animal loses heat.</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of a gram of mouse is therefore much larger than with a gram of elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal is therefore more dangerous and should concentrate on having as many offspring as possible as early as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"on the other hand, a very large animal should invest its resources into a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">The ministers from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the road on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>

<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, and Greol, and Haigerloch, and holy rooms, went their way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, Reverend Storost sent pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the crosses and shared the pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb we drove by train to the starting point of Villingen, where also a Münster-old loved woman is standing and so the pilgrimage route from Münster started."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the individual day tours were framed in the morning and evening by a short impulse with various prayers, songs and written texts."</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner raced last night in the Velorom men's sprint in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor role, which his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy had made. the jubilee proudly made the legend when he stormed home to win a victory from the favorites New Zealand."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">"they repeated the trick after they held only a modest sixth place in London, despite the withdrawal of Hoys in March."</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retirement created a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">"Skinner was the man in whom they remained, when they saw potential in the Scots, which has now unfolded."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hindes, Kenny - four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner set an Olympic circuit in the qualification rounds, but in the standars the New Zealanders won in the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"Hindes lag behind his lap, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, in which Hinder rode in a higher gear to slow him down and allow Kenny and especially Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked from his position as BBC expert and dropped Skinner, Kenny and Hindes when they got on the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">The 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said: "it is a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make me a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We set up an olympic board in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the triumph in 2012 at the side of Kenny and Hoys, Hindes admitted that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He withdrew this statement later and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such problem."</seg>
<seg id="23">Hinder said: "it feels like the whole UK flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have come together as a team over the past three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did so badly with so many worldtitles that it was incredible to win again at the Olympiad.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which won seven out of 10 titles both in Beijing and in London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the past five months, we expect successful five days in the cycle of Velodrom."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it is possible to win Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny - who was exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who also was born on March 23 (apparently holy date for British sports; on that day Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - a yield of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">Kenny takes part next in the Sprint that will start today and will go for three days.</seg>
<seg id="32">"the 28-year-old from Bolton said," I just enjoy this for the moment. "</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"Hinder said:" "if he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-four kilometre race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the World Record, which won gold in London 2012, was at 3: 51.659."</seg>
<seg id="41">The first and final round (22.42) will take place on the second day of the competition where Wiggins will focus on security.</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday he had argued with delegates before the qualification, when he called him functionaries to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in the corresponding women competition, which will be continued and finished tomorrow, Laura Trott, Joanna Rowel Shandler, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The GB team relies on its strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and to pick a band of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly exceptional representation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"dramas took place in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April was in the midst of sexism and mutiny reproaches and the retirement of magnitudes such as Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if you look at the first evening of the competition in the Velodrom, it looks quite as if the legendary reputation GBs, which has reached its peak at the perfect moment, will be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the sundry of Portland due to the lifting of the energy loss questionable</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium molten from Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the system operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby abolishes all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria at the beginning of this year, no further subsidies to the operation of the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years is running out in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the plant of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">Not less than 2000 jobs -direct as well as indirect - could be at risk of closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects, as the enamel is consumed around 10 percent of the total electricity generation of Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa closed the Point Henry melt, which led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant last year."</seg>
<seg id="9">The melt of Alcoa in Portland is losing money and risks a closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation concerning the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last due to the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melting workshop with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three further owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture between Alcoa and Alumina, the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp holding smaller shares."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity through the melting process," said the company. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were called" "hedging transactions", "which should come into force from November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a period of 12 months, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"for this reason, AGL assumes that the contracts will contribute to revenue in fiscal year 17," said the electricity supplier. "</seg>
<seg id="17">All potential impacts on the income on AGL from the GJ 18 are currently limited by forecasts of strong futures prices for wholesale electricity prices.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL informed that the value of the contracts had already been written in his annual subscription in the amount of $187 million in "anticipation of a cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said that the decision to book the contracts, the" Ability of Alcoas... to operate the melt, or to ensure the power supply to the melt "is not impaired."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the US company said that 2010 has concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang, who should have come into force from November this year, even if it is still an explanation as to why it resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the branch before the possible closure of the Portland melt in Victoria and the Tomago plant near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts and a total of around 900 megawatts of electricity per year."</seg>
<seg id="23">"if both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a considerable reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and it wouldn't be good for us as a generator," "he said."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and the fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian-Jenner clan Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the American Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estee Lauder and ran at the Fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced the news on her Instagram account on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"the cover of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply keeping Up with the Kardashians similar?), a critical reality video that shows the entire Kardashian-Jenner family (with the exception of the problem cases Rob and Caitlyn), as they forget the cover of their sister and that ends with a classic twist: they all planned a surprise party."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the stereotyped action of nearly every birthday episode of a children's programme (Seacrest brought the sentence," "You thought we had forgotten you?", "with the honesty of a cartoon squad at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls somehow participate in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September issue of the Vogue, a new era of kardashians has certainly begun."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her, as far as the Vogue cover was concerned (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September edition is the most sold issue of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that resembles more an illustrated book than a fashion magazine, the issue attracts a large number of advertisers (According Fashionista were 615 pp advertisement pages of the 832 pages of the tome."</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover-stars is expected so eagerly that in the last two years pictures of the magazine leakage before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women who were already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years, there were clearly more celebrities that modeled as" Models representing celebrities "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar winner and Dior brand ambassador Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honour."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the small chance that Mrs. Jenner, who is described by the magazine as the" breakthrough model "of her generation - falls below the previous category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities are not related to famous persons or reality stars or young people of today who know how to shoot a good snapshot video (even if everything applies to Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the release of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners's success doesn't like everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with its reality TV history, Jenners's position in the fashion world was always somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in June, the former Victoria's Secret model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized her and called her" the mistletos of the moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings were once again high when the news came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue Cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying around on the misfortune seems to drop by the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">She makes advertising for your primer of Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">She and her sisters sell pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>
<seg id="29">She sells her made pictures of Cindy Crawford's daughter to the magazine WTV.</seg>

<seg id="2">"e-mail and internet in slow motion: 20 years ago, the Nokia Communicator came onto the market."</seg>
<seg id="3">The successors now dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it wasn't good either."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was pretty bulky."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory at the beginning was eight megabytes, which would now suffice for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now supplied with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the Nokia 9000 Communicator was launched exactly 20 years ago, on 15 August 1996, in stores - and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, fans can still buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">The Finnish mobile phone manufacturer announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hannover as an "office in the West pocket format."</seg>
<seg id="13">"indeed, the new mobile phone was able to send and receive a lot for those standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax the communicator was to be contacted."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even the access to web pages was possible by using HTML browsers, albeit quelly slow."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">There was a small antenna and the mobile phone could be folded similar to a laptop.</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black-and-white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 euros."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">Since then everything is different.</seg>
<seg id="22">Smart phones are a success story if not for Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Finns mobile phone division experienced an unprecedented disaster, was eventually sold and handled to Microsoft."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today the market is dominated by suppliers that all came much later than Nokia.</seg>
<seg id="25">"always and everywhere online, this is today for a lot of people everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in 2015, there were almost two billion smartphone users worldwide."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Heathrow will bring renewal and prosperity not only in our local communities and throughout London, but throughout the country."</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London, when we had a big effort to ensure that all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympics brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And that will be achieved by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies near Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="6">"for our local communities alone, we will create 10,000 new jobs alone, create 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment."</seg>
<seg id="7">"as they were ahead of us in London 2012, there will be those who will think that the challenge of expansion Heathrow is too great."</seg>
<seg id="8">I was told that England will never be ready for the Games and that we will be blaming ourselves on the world stage.</seg>
<seg id="9">The doubters were wrong in 2012 and they will be wrong even at Heathrow.</seg>
<seg id="10">"there are always obstacles to overcome, but Heathrow answers every question asked."</seg>
<seg id="11">"like the Olympic Games, Heathrow is for many and not for individuals an infrastructure project."</seg>
<seg id="12">"expansion is a way to create up to 180,000 new jobs, £211 billion in spirited growth, and to leave a legacy of skills and employment both around the airport and in the whole of the UK."</seg>
<seg id="13">"we have a great team at Heathrow, which has implemented a £11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget, from the T5 - which was built five years in succession to the world's best airport terminal, up to T2, which was built in the midst of the two most frequented catwalks in the world."</seg>
<seg id="14">"now they are ready to provide a third run, which is supported by £16 billion in private investment."</seg>
<seg id="15">London's 2012 games were a great success for GB and I am confident that Heathrow's expansion will also be one.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to one of the software manufacturers, attempts to circumvent ad blockage are the same for companies who earn money with online advertising."</seg>
<seg id="3">"on Thursday, only two days after Facebook announced that there were blocking signs on its desktop side, Adblock Plus released a blog post in which it announced that users could update their filters in the program to block advertising on the social network again."</seg>
<seg id="4">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that his desktop side would change the coding related to its advertisements in order to make it difficult to detect the indication that is part of the page advertising."</seg>
<seg id="5">But Adblock announced that it has found a new way to bypass the new codes.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in a blog post, the spokesman of Adblock Ben Williams wrote that" "this kind of hin-and-forth struggle between the time-giving open source community and the converters has been underway since the invention of display lockers", "and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fact that the world's largest social media company has entered the fight is a strong indication of how worrying indicator blowers have become the industry.</seg>
<seg id="8">"according to a study published last year by Pagefair and Adobe, some 200 million people use display lockers worldwide, almost four times as much in 2013."</seg>
<seg id="9">"with 1.03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices, mobile advertising makes 84 percent of advertising revenue Facebooks."</seg>

<seg id="11">"advertisement on desktop PCs is a sufficient amount of revenue, so Facebook appears worthwhile investment of such a step."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on Tuesday, Facebook announced that it would update its" "ad preference pool" "in order to have more control over the advertised advertising."</seg>

<seg id="3">The police call witnesses after a woman in the early morning hours on Thursday transferred to a presumed suicide of several vehicles on a highway.</seg>
<seg id="4">The incident occurred on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vaud shortly after midnight.</seg>
<seg id="5">"a woman lay in the dark" in an act of despair "on the street and were hit by several cars, the police said in Vaud."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it is obvious that a Swiss woman at the age of 49, including a lorry, wanted to kill himself."</seg>
<seg id="7">She died on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="8">"several drivers have already been heard, but some have not yet been identified, the police said these as well as every witness of the incident prompt to report."</seg>
<seg id="9">"an investigation procedure was opened, which is a" logical "step in such a situation, Gilles Hofstetter informed the Le Tribune de Geneve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="11">Was a collision avoidable?</seg>
<seg id="12">"that is something the prosecutor has to decide," Hofstetter said. "</seg>
<seg id="13">Two similar cases in the last five years show that drivers will not be held accountable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"in each of the two cases where a person ran in the dark on the highway, it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian runs in the middle of the night on the highway as it was in the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="15">"last year, a policewoman was acquitted of the negligent killing after crossing a man who killed a man on the A1 in August 2014 near Payerne."</seg>
<seg id="16">"the 22-year-old victim had drunk and became unconscious on the street, took judgment."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably habitable."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms similar to those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere, could have had similar conditions."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of the Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation indicates that Venus could have had a thin, erily-like atmosphere and still turned on slowly."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably had more dry areas than the Earth, but once had enough water and geographical variability to accommodate life and protected from quicker evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">Early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus exposed its day-side of the sun for almost two months," declared GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain which creates a thick layer of clouds, which acts like an umbrella to shield the surface from a large part of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than those of the Earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model produced a history of Venus that resembles the evolution previously assumed by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although she was originally habitable, Venus -- over the course of several billions years --was exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their steam was fired from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogen, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide remained with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which we know today."</seg>

<seg id="3">"the new data help astronomers understand why stars are rotating in star-loops to different rates, as well as in what connection the rotational periods stand with the planetary origin."</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other star loops, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.

<seg id="5">The star-pile of the Pleiades lies 445 light-years distant from the earth.</seg>
<seg id="6">"many stars in this star-run, which originated approximately 125 million years ago, now reach adulthood."</seg>
<seg id="7">They are now turning to the fastest.</seg>
<seg id="8">"at peak rotation rates, these ripening stars repel large amounts of star winds."</seg>

<seg id="14">"in the" Ballet "of the Pleiades we see that slow rotors tend to be massive, whereas faster rotors tend to be very bright stars," said Rebull. "</seg>

<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail malware are currently targeted at companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey by malware defense specialists Malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have been at least once, partly multiple victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, almost 20 percent of companies were already aiming for ransomware extortion."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom paid by the perpetrators in order to recover the challenged systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes to attack corporate networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to obtain ransom is much higher than in private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a startling speedy evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes chief Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most Malwareprograms were still designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for himself.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to corporate attacks was frightening rapidly over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works according to a simple pattern: once on a victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as for archives of pictures and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypts the ransomware and deletes the originals sustainably.</seg>
<seg id="14">"afterwards, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"to get the end key code to the files, the victims must transfer money - mostly in the form of cryptograph Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but where private users find the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned with sensitive customer data or project databases, without which production still stands still."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage falls when a ransomware is added."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of affected German companies reported sales losses due to ransomware, 13 percent even had to break down business operations, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks whose patients may be acutely acutely acutely affected by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say the victims: do not pay, you only promote the problem," explains Kleczynski. "</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of companies pay their data again."</seg>
<seg id="22">"for managers, it is difficult to reject the demand of the perpetrators in the face of standstill in operation."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the hackers, in turn, know this and try to build a good reputation."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the Safety Researchers of F-Secure explored the use areas and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators are actually trying to build a kind of customer service to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain their victims per chat, how they can pay by Bitcoin, set up freely accessible support websites or decrypt for free example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private persons are redeemed for payments of a few hundred euros, companies must partly negotiate hard and pay five-digit amounts to withdraw their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively risky gains from ransomware extortion, the hackers become more professional and share their work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the antivirus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware about within a week. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, you roll around eternally, at night you lie awake for hours, in the morning you can no longer think of sleep long before the alarm bell rings."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to the Robert Koch Institute, approximately one quarter of adults sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep often or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleep problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons underlying them, emphasises Hans-Günter Weeks, board member of the German Society of Sleeping and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what you understand, however, is the insomnia, that is, a disturbance and sleep disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"seeing through sleep many people perceive as unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German pet association with practice in the Lower Saxony Varel."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"organic, psychological or behavioural factors can be found behind them, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">"often, sleep disorder is an expression of another disorder."</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is often common in depression," "said Weeks."</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors require each other.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a disc failure, can lie badly, wakes up every two to three hours and possibly starts to ponder about everyday problems and worries, Weeks gives an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should you sleep with sleep disorders a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"who does not sleep well over a period of one month in at least three nights a week and is affected the day, should go to the doctor advises the process."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment may look quite different: you are beaten, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"to alleviate sleep disorders, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioral changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medication - classic sleeping pills only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"there is hardly any psychoanalyst in Germany, emphasises Prof. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary research center at the Charité University Hospital in Berlin."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, in case of sleeping problems, one should first turn to the family doctor, advises the process."</seg>
<seg id="24">It can clarify with studies whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for example, in case of snoring with airdropouts, in case of illness fatigue, in case of sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a sleep disturbance, Fietze explains."</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normal.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only please do not make a nap," "says Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after sinking, one goes into the bed for his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"besides the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a feeler at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera is drawing on the ceiling to the sleeping end."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can sufferers get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws on which one can sleep for a better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Weeks counts: regular sleep and sit-up times, lying not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch television for sleeping, avoid alcohol and do not look at the watch at night - then one starts to reckon immediately, and that is quite and not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="4">"compared to a Lidl, which is to be demolished soon, a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here until 2017."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in recent weeks, articles about this" trendy neighborhood, "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain calls, is preferred by burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with the number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have leased contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, especially the Berlin indoor senator Henkel had spoken several times for a hard procedure of police against the project, the area referred to as a" no-go zone "for policemen and the 94 as the starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on 22 June, the premises on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, had been evacuated with 300 police officers, with 30 to 40 officials and three team cars on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with the number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers commissioned by the unknown homeowners commissioned the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin Administrative Court decided that the clearance was illegal, and one day later police and construction workers retired from sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the street works peacefully: parents walk with children, people sit on the sidewalk in front of the houses in the sun, others talk about late i."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the immediate vicinity of the house projects, there is a primary school and kindergartens."</seg>
<seg id="13">"leftist violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who lives in Kiez since 1999, and Jana *, who runs three children here, is mostly annoyed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the residents of the building projects, they share the concern about increasing rents and gentrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">It doesn't sound like a Kiez who wants mostly police protection against vandaliatory left.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trench, which the Berlin interior ordinator and the police do between house-occupiers and their neighbors, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class neighborhood, which also today has a low average in comparison to the rest of the city and has a high risk of poverty."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer Strasse in close proximity to the Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer had been evacuated under large police charges in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in Riga and are partly occupied by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, the district has become a magnet for tourists and electors from around the world over the last few years."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also reflected in the rents, which have increased by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">Many of the newbuildings in the Rīga are attacked as symbols for this development: one can recognize them at dumped windows or freshly painted facades that were thrown with color bags.</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year along with the words "leftist violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason for not seeing all neighbours as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime: crimes like body injury, according to statistics, are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most of the crimes make property damage, which tend to meet new buildings and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a rented house next to the disputed 94 for 17 years, there can be no talk of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as far as violence is concerned, it is important: people in the 94 are their neighbours who have not been that."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Riga Zoo.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architect, her street is not a criminal focal point, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the street and gets more from each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately pulled into the Riga Strait - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"that is why it was so important to her that the residents got their way back: from the police, politics and the media, which in July all suddenly demanded the sovereignty of the city."</seg>
<seg id="32">"however, in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer the road continues to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former building gaps that the old inhabitants are displacing."</seg>
<seg id="33">"these are ultimately condominiums, which are not interesting for many - here people who are not so good are living here," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "violence and destruction I can absolutely not approve." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should one do if someone never listens?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding for those who are annoyed about colour bombs: the Hautes and the left-wing scene belonged to the Kiez.</seg>

<seg id="7">"Regine customer from the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than thankful that Deuschle is there, the eiving Wollmilksau, which has above all a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less mocking than on the multitude of desired tasks - had purposefully - meant that the administration wanted to leave the place."</seg>
<seg id="9">"looking for an administrative specialist with a talent for languages and people, combined with many years of experience in the field of social work, just an experienced wool milky sau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not its central area, says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organization, work with local people and also behind the scenes as well as networking activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has a 50-percent position limited to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time players. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are large and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">Soon there are new containers in the washing line</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting refugees that have been acknowledged.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for connecting the connection.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or hired living rooms.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the costs for the construction, rent or renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the municipalities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the Councillor Office to the Commune and Jobcentre.</seg>
<seg id="22">Problem: there are free objects but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment.</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, the administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it does not work so far, one relies on private apartments, such as Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, common dwellings need to be intimidated as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">So soon new containers will be placed in the washing line.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine's customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence, there are internships, training centres, school courts, one-euro jobs and employment services for refugees and migrants who need to be repaired or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help home masters, do non-profit work - and that motivated and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">She hopes that the work for the community will lead to a positive external action.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy." ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need offers like sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rar.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, here too, administration and honorary officials jump here."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling that they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"you need to explain to the refugees that it takes a long time to bridge them, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"if you develop the feeling, he can't help anyone in Urbach, do not work and be useless, he will never be able to integrate himself."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"the work of Deuschle and the customer is, therefore, always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a "mammoth task."</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: did the two follow the latest incidents of fear of radicalization, even in a small community like Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," "Regine customer says clearly," "what some naive might call." "a residual risk could and should not exclude it."</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to the refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins would bring them completely to call.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," says Regine Customer. "</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">"thus, main and honorary officials must look out for activities in the region and in the region."</seg>
<seg id="56">They are always in the background that a new push to refugees and migrants will soon come to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a cap?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, politics is afraid."</seg>
<seg id="59">"in fact, it is unfair to place them on site."</seg>
<seg id="60">"we have not arrived in Urbach where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, that would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">"also, Regine customer makes clear that the Urbach is already busy integrating the previous people in a reasonable way."</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but when people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
