Obama receives Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not just friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing action in the Middle East .
&quot; at the meeting , however , it is also about the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
Washington is critici@@ zing the ongoing settlement building of Israel and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process .
the deal with Iran &apos;s nuclear programme promoted by Obama has deterior@@ ated further .
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu held a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans before the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront to Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not spoken with Obama , a meeting had declined to this with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor decides to have shot his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb spoke with a somewhat sha@@ ky voice of the police that he shot his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
lamb it was important to stress that his &quot; cute dog &quot; still lives and is probably excited and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the phone .
&quot; inside the house , the officials found the bodies of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note that was ch@@ ewed on a white block : &quot; I am so sorry I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb , who was in two online courses for Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already passed 300 miles to the school grounds , where according to the police , he shot and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University Poli@@ gn@@ ef Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said that university staff have heard the shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the disa@@ strous emergency call later .
until the end of the day there was another death : the Lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him .
&quot; a day after the shooting at the university , which forced students and lec@@ turers to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him helped draw a picture of a talented but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to their lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; wonderful people &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students attended courses from both . &quot;
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous , &quot; as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that he told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb had asked the Delta State University for an absence of health reasons and said that he had any health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
&quot; recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion , for which Lamb had worked so hard , would not represent a guarantee for an automatic way to an appointment as Assistant Professor . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
&quot; these are questions , which Lamb can no longer answer . &quot;
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police later found Lam@@ bs track when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before he could be arrested , Lamb killed himself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ bre pist@@ ol in the back@@ yard of a house about a mile south of his childhood home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said Washington County Cor@@ oner Meth@@ el Johnson . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why Lamb went to this house , but Johnson said that she believes that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; lamb began its work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12@@ ,000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he did his doctorate in spring in Pe@@ dago@@ gy .
&quot; one of the long @-@ standing friends Lam@@ bs described him as intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and Lamb was 20 , when they met by common friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in high school , and he was the cool older guy who tried several years to teach her the guitar . &quot;
at that time he was the wom@@ ens s@@ warm .
&quot; all the girls melt away when he was there , &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjacent to a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed on the ground , &quot; &quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
&quot; Lamb met Pr@@ enti@@ ss , when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both on a summer fair three years ago . &quot;
later they played together one or two gig .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said , his daughter writes and sings their own music . &quot;
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes an entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a poorly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said he had finished Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night at night 5 September , after Lamb had finished his guitar and oral harmon@@ ic@@ as@@ pi@@ el before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of cul@@ let .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialised in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Mit@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as and was president of his Brotherhood and the student committee .
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , staff , students and members of the community at a cand@@ l@@ eli@@ ght commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Schmid@@ ts Frau Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the &quot; &quot; M@@ ahn@@ wache &quot; , &quot; while the Univers@@ itä@@ tsch@@ or &quot; &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Ama@@ zing Grace &quot; &quot; sang . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to make our students return , &quot; &quot; La@@ For@@ ge said . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; associate Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ sters P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story was corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb made the emergency call , after he shot Schmidt , and that lamb described in his emergency call Pr@@ enti@@ ss even as his wife , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire fewer workers for Christmas
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be as many Christmas seasonal workers as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it planned to employ 40,000 people in stores and distribution centres throughout the country . in the Christmas season 2014 , 45@@ ,000 workers were recru@@ ited . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees increases from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are still months away , the Christmas business is getting closer , and companies are preparing to hire temporary workers to furn@@ ish shops with employees selling , sending and delivering products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox che@@ er on his &quot; date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theater waiting for the roy@@ als and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it will gradually become clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the film begins , and it comes to mind that I &apos;m a simulated g@@ lowing and a knife @-@ length away from being with the princess of Wales on a date . &quot;
&quot; back in Time , a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as with director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it &apos;s really true for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel movie ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN CEO says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of the almost five @-@ year @-@ long conflict , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN chief once again calls on all parties , including the divided UN Security Council , to unite and to support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; ban said a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - at the end of the meeting of the General Assembly to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and within the Syrian people and the regional powers make this situation in@@ soluble .
ban requested the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity to overcome the crisis in Syria which they have demonstrated in achieving a nuclear deal with Iran .
8 survey values that show that Donald Tru@@ mp is taken seriously .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have dismissed him as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Repub@@ lic@@ ans try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in p@@ olls down@@ wards , it has ( still ) not working . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last eleven national surveys revealed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously ask what it means for the chances of nomin@@ ating real estate mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts emphasize that at this time in 2011 Rick Per@@ r@@ ys leadership was handed over to the rising Her@@ man Cain , none of whom gained only a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he would have to fight in a general election .
but out@@ si@@ ders like J@@ eb Bush &apos;s Super PAC@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now see Tru@@ mps staying power and begin to let their dollars flow to overthrow him .
here are some current survey values that suggest that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l is not only a temporary phase :
the mps of arbit@@ rar@@ iness have turned 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his can@@ did@@ acy in mid @-@ June , a survey conducted by Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l positively . &quot;
by mid @-@ July it was 40 percent .
at the beginning of August there were 52 percent .
&quot; now , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
about three of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are held in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa concluded last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two thirds of GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; delighted &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp would be nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two out of 10 say they would be &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
&quot; only Ben Car@@ son creates about the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; vs. 40 percent who say the same about Tru@@ mp ) . &quot;
the next one in terms of enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand 47 percent of Republi@@ can voters say they would be &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; angry &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans do not see the tru@@ mp temper@@ ament as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is widely critic@@ ised for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive remarks , 52 percent of the Irish voters tend to believe that the real estate Mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , so ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is in the first pres@@ election state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the re@@ public@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless 44 percent think that he did not have the personality to effectively carry out his ministry , and almost six of 10 independent states say that his temper@@ ament pas@@ se does not fit into the White House , as ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they expose their scholars , republi@@ can elec@@ tors keep Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; when asked , who most likely wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , according to a survey of CN@@ N / OR@@ C from last week four out of ten , Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time four of the ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
full disclosure : GO@@ P @-@ voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball in the past .
at this time in the final cycle four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination compared to only 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney .
&quot; nevertheless , there is evidence that a variety of GO@@ P @-@ elec@@ tors Tru@@ mps campaign can be seen as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Repub@@ lic@@ ans were gathering around another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating almost everyone . &quot;
&quot; some experts suggest that the fragmented field probably contributes to tru@@ mp leadership , while the anti @-@ tru@@ mp support is distributed over more than a dozen other candidates . &quot;
&quot; but a survey by Mon@@ mouth @-@ University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp has re@@ aped the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has before C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina 13 points advantage , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , before Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush ninet@@ een points and finally before Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
&quot; a new pol@@ l by C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only slightly more than half of voters support Tru@@ mp , say they have set their votes firmly . &quot;
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can truly say change the mind . &quot;
46 percent said that they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nonetheless , tru@@ mp is the strongest competitor at the moment of other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their minds are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; since Donald Tru@@ mp , in his election campaign two months ago , called immigrants from Mexico &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point of the public discourse became apparent in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp will keep decisive His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation effort .
&quot; but according to the new ABC / Post enquiry from Monday , six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration issues . &quot;
&quot; so long as immigration remains in the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , Donald Tru@@ mp seems to do so . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile accounts for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially by their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Monday pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are also angry at Washington .
&quot; a survey by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans have been frustr@@ ated about the re@@ public@@ ans in the congress , with 54 per cent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive residential areas in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg you find the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the North Sea .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a roof @-@ roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 Euro . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which particular locations one square meter is the most expensive .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top dwelling places , however , the price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German dwell@@ ings - with square footage in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several tens of thousands of Euro ni@@ x - per square meter , well noted . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
&quot; by the way : here , as an exception , Munich is not at the top . &quot;
champi@@ ons League : Bayern dream start thanks to Müller and Göt@@ ze
double bull@@ sh@@ it in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller just has a run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller was pav@@ ing the way to a well deserved 3 : 0 at the Olympi@@ ac@@ os Pi@@ raeus - then it was running .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze created a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Milan &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
the team of Trainer P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won her kick @-@ off in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ac@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Doppel@@ pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hits ( 8@@ 9th ) with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth success in series should be the first step towards the final on May 28 , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to take the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot to Munich in the third attempt . &quot;
&quot; at his 28th place in the Champions League , Müller received good help from the Olympi@@ ac@@ os go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto , who made a f@@ lange of the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; we won &apos;t under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; Bayern @-@ captain Philipp L@@ ahm , in front of the match at the Kar@@ ais@@ k@@ ak@@ is stadium , promised hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans before the match - and the Munich kept his word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed performance without being too bright .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his latest six home games in the King &apos;s class , including well @-@ known clubs such as Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund was also proud ( 1 : 3 ) .
&quot; but Bavaria , defeated in seven European @-@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , did not want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but in their aggressive endea@@ vors , but often too resour@@ ceful . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were triggered too often by a shift to the left outside Douglas Costa , which was rarely penet@@ rated against the former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Müller had more luck from the right , when his flan@@ k came from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate . &quot;
&quot; in the 6@@ 7th minute , the World Champion gave the possible 2 : 0 . &quot;
the best occasions in half @-@ one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , as the Olympi@@ ac@@ os @-@ Stür@@ mer ide@@ ye Brown beat the head ball of Poland from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
then by direct debit the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto par@@ ted with his knee ( 35 . ) .
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians bred their usual dominant game , Pi@@ raeus was able to make con@@ i@@ fer@@ ous need@@ les . &quot;
but there was a decree on go@@ al@@ keeper Manuel Neu@@ er .
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot of ide@@ ye about the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; before New , Guardi@@ ola left a four @-@ dimensional chain with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , who did it well . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cabin , was sitting outside . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup Her@@ o gave the green light only after the final training , said sports board Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; those who want to make something different from it is already malign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardian decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an to Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th . ) . &quot;
&quot; gra@@ ze came late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter Müller added one . &quot;
before the game it was in the stadium of Kra@@ v@@ allen .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly mu@@ dd@@ led Bayern fans in their audience block apparently provoked the supporters of host Pi@@ raeus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and attacked the Munich fans with striking sticks . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ Fan was transported out of the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , not only har@@ ms the lungs but also teeth - this is what a Pots@@ dam@@ er long @-@ term study suggests . &quot;
good news : with ren@@ unciation reduces the risk quickly .
smokers have a much higher risk of losing their teeth at an early age .
&quot; this results from the long @-@ term study of an international research team , among them several members of the German Institute for Food Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth pre@@ mat@@ urely in order to increase the 2,@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 f@@ x . &quot;
&quot; the scientists observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; main causes of tooth loss are tooth decay and inflammation of the gin@@ gi@@ va , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for these perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis , smoking is a risk factor , emphas@@ ise the authors . &quot;
the connection between smoking and loss of teeth is therefore attributed to more frequent gum infections in smokers .
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who stopped smoking could reduce their risk in a short time , write the researchers in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but it could last for over ten years , until endanger@@ ing fall back on the level of non @-@ smokers , Er@@ du@@ ke Thomas Dietrich explained from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one has to convince people to be non @-@ smokers , head of study leader H@@ einer Boeing of DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking reduces the life time . &quot;
&quot; smoking is good for lung and blood vessels and , according to our findings , leads to good dental health up to a high age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , more than 20 percent of the population is affected by tooth@@ lessness in the age of 65 to 74 years , divided the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early tooth loss .
the new long @-@ term study under@@ lines the findings .
archae@@ ologists meet in Cologne Rhein@@ u@@ fer on rem@@ nants of late Anti@@ quity
archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne for the repeated time .
&quot; in the vicinity of the building site for the new Rhine Boulevard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum were excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians are searching for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; for all construction projects in the municipal district of Cologne , the museum is always considered as a technical department for archaeological excav@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the third stage of the Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found five . &quot;
&quot; from text documents , it was already known that in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century stood a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; besides the remains of the fortress and the church tower there was also a cemetery with around 350 graves , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman captured by train
&quot; after a young woman is caught at the station in the ho@@ stage l@@ enti@@ ls , the Federal Police asks the people for help . &quot;
&quot; early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40 p.m. , the woman from the direction of the station building crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a train from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; due to the acquisition of the train , it has suffered har@@ dest injuries from the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated in emergency by emergency and brought to a hospital by ambul@@ ance .
&quot; on the basis of the noc@@ turn@@ al crossing of the young woman , no knowledge is found to the central officials . &quot;

European Commission proposes new court in dispute over TTIP
&quot; to resolve the dispute over the TTIP free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration institutions for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its way of operation is much more traditional . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; said S &amp; D Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot;
the Swe@@ de wants to introduce the proposal as a European negoti@@ ator in the free trade talks with the US .
the German government announced support .
&quot; through TTIP , the world &apos;s largest free trade zone is to be produced with 800 million people . &quot;
the plans for the reform of the current arbit@@ ration proceedings envis@@ age con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US will jointly select independent judges for a new Federal Court of Investment .
&quot; they should come to equal share from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
for the first time there is also a second instance .
it would allow it to obj@@ ected against judgement .
&quot; so far , the parties involved agreed to each other on refer@@ ees , but there was no objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion over the past few months , it has become clear that citizens of the old IS@@ DS system did not trust in fair@@ ness and justice , &quot; said Malm@@ ström . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , according to his own data , she wants to work on an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; there , for example , disputes between Chinese companies and EU states could be clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; the Investor @-@ State Ar@@ bit@@ ration ( IS@@ DS ) , especially demanded by large corporations , is regarded as one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP . &quot;
&quot; the traditional courts of arbit@@ ration have been critic@@ ised by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , which allows companies to dispute the tax pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first comments , anti @-@ TTIP organizations like Camp@@ act described the proposals of the European Commission as inadequate . &quot;
&quot; above all , it was not critic@@ ised for the free trade agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) that had already been negotiated . &quot;
&quot; the German econom@@ ist , Matthias Mach@@ nig ( SPD ) , on the other hand described the plans as a major advance . &quot;
&quot; during the reform , the Commission considered essential points by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel , in spring with other EU trade ministers . &quot;
the old system of private arbit@@ ration is from the table .
the French government also welcomed the plans of Malm@@ ström .
the European business association business Europe warned against limiting the economic potential of the economy by too many new rules .
&quot; in this way , especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged . &quot;
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) agreement can be concluded , it remains unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been running since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not been discussed with the United States . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement was to be signed at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is regarded as un@@ sustainable .
delicate Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy working folk singer recorded the picturesque U.S. state Mich@@ igan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the entire audience , about 40 people , is almost caught by St@@ ev@@ ens &apos;s lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of various places he repeatedly records on the map , about his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ous and delicate arranged songs . &quot;
where they originated and what it looks like in his homeland .
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be wonderfully creative . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be harmon@@ i@@ ously very close to American folk in the late six@@ ties , but can always drift into great opul@@ ents at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our , &quot; Mich@@ igan , &quot; would be the first part of a we@@ ary series : each of the 50 states should be obe@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; however , already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven Sw@@ ans &quot; has already appeared and has a positive impact on expectations . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens is reduced here .
guitar and ban@@ jo are enough for him .
&quot; one year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; in 2005 , &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) appears in 2005 a comprehensive masterpiece . &quot;
bor@@ dering on ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
&lt; b &gt; There is no information available for this album yet !
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensively electronic displacement pieces . &quot;
&quot; this sixth scheduled studio album is still broad@@ ly orchest@@ rated , but worn by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all sorts of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; since the smaller clubs have desc@@ ended , the stage shows are here for the colourful spectacle of ne@@ on head@@ bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot;
currently Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band .
in the glo@@ om@@ ily held Hamburger More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although here nearly 2000 guests are now sitting in their chairs , the significantly more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians plays through the wide enriched album . &quot;
you hear from the audience : the lecture is &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; and you can basically throw away the &quot; record . &quot;
&quot; St@@ ev@@ ens only thank@@ ed himself for an en@@ core , plays a few older songs acousti@@ cally and finally bows down under tos@@ sing applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Ques@@ tions
&quot; since his election , Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s qui@@ ver is expected to be eag@@ erly awaited . &quot;
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n should give his debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s questions and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to meet the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after lunch , and his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs from nearby . &quot;
he called for &quot; less theatre and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip some sessions to leave her colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns leadership , as it comes after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and after his speech at the TU@@ C Annual Meeting on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour president to remain silent on Tuesday during the singing of the National An@@ them during a commemor@@ ative ceremony to commemor@@ ate the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain , has provoked a number of T@@ ory MPs and is at the heart of several titles of titles in the newspapers . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them , has attracted attention &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he was &quot; &quot; respect@@ ful of silence &quot; &quot; and he recognized the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the BBC Two news@@ night program , he advised the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; independent &quot; from his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; almost a dozen of shadow @-@ ministers refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s top team , and they called themselves on differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
the BBC &apos;s political correspon@@ dent says that political differences are also within Labour &quot; st@@ acking &quot; by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and limiting profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes put forward to remove the whole idea of a limitation overall .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ worker and pensions minister said that the party is &quot; &quot; very clear &quot; &quot; that it is only against government plans to reduce the limitation of £ 26@@ ,000 to £ 23@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader , David Cameron ever since he is a T@@ ory boss , across the Dis@@ patch Box in Parliament over the last decade . &quot;
&quot; the Labour leader , who promised a different politi@@ cian , says he has made &quot; crowd @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and gave him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the Ques@@ tion@@ n@@ aire of the Prime Minister is too confron@@ t@@ ative and that he will refrain from both &quot; &quot; striking &quot; &quot; and the quar@@ rel with resistance and instead focusing on serious problems such as poverty , inequality and the challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister , will represent him if he does not participate - for example , when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he has also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally speak the word , and that he spoke to John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; &quot; P@@ unch &quot; &quot; theatre , often linked to the Prime Minister &apos;s question . but a few years later , he admitted that he failed in doing so . &quot;
&quot; since it was first broadcast on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the Prime Minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the Supreme Court of a leader and his leadership in the House of Com@@ mons and his position among his members of Parliament , although critics have ar@@ gues that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and would require extensive reforms . &quot;

the Po@@ und rises through accelerated wage growth in the United Kingdom
&quot; the pound jumped to data , which showed an increase in the UK &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the SA@@ B@@ Miller &apos;s bid goal . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , the result without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
&quot; since 2009 , this percentage has been the fastest and earnings estim@@ ation at the time of an increase in interest rates . &quot;
&quot; the pound jumped by more than 1 % over the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % over the euro to € 1.@@ 37@@ 30 . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 index included an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a leap of 20 % after the acquisition offer of the rival AB In@@ Be@@ v was received .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and combine brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch . &quot;
Bur@@ berry shares were after encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods Rich@@ em@@ ont 0.@@ 9 % higher .
&quot; Rich@@ em@@ on@@ ts &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations , and showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - reported growth . &quot;
&quot; shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose by 5 % , after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion dollars through a share sale as part of his debt reduction strategy . &quot;
&quot; the shares of the packaging and paper company Mon@@ di were the largest los@@ ers in the index , with a 4.3 % decline after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s had made his assessment for the company R@@ ating on sale . &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports increased by 3.1 % , after the sports service company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the first half of the year . &quot;
the head of J@@ D Sports says that higher wages end@@ anger the expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers is &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labour costs of his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the cost could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and this could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;
J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber in the Capital : on the Bie@@ ber @-@ Expedition in Berlin
&quot; J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; 21 years young , a tra@@ iling with a top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line Fr@@ ise . &quot;
the type with the plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euros heavy .
rather even more .
&quot; currently , Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is currently in Berlin . &quot;
and the generation U@@ 17 turns through .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; however , since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of the Berlin luxury hotel at Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; Bie@@ ber @-@ Bau : here you live I@@ dol , whose posters hang on in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs the day exactly as much as her mother E@@ wa deserves in the half year . &quot;
if at all .
&quot; she says : &quot; &quot; actually , my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; I fill her a dream . &quot;
compulsory scho@@ oling ?
who is it ?
the fans do not .
also Bie@@ ber himself does not .
he has taken care of anyway .
&quot; for the advertisement in the advertisement of the Super@@ lap he assi@@ ged three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ ples company donated many , many dollars to the Bie@@ ber account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll that looks like him and goes over the counter , bending is collected too . &quot;
&quot; when J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee , one wonders at the window pane . &quot;
he is said to have exploited more than 100 million in such a way .
some say the hyp@@ e goes too far .
&quot; others stress that , after all , Bie@@ ber was just in the US and the UK with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; in place 1 . &quot;
&quot; Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , are not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to Pot@@ ato idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both - and in the Pot@@ ato d@@ ön@@ er , who developed the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ ach owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the saying &quot; potato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay potato and meat put together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
the idea brought him a poster on a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; which he acci@@ dentally saw on TV .
&quot; since then , there is a grill sk@@ ewer available in his store , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is multi@@ cul@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the Lebanese had the idea to register at the Patent Office in Munich . &quot;
it has recently been protected as a utility model according to the authority .
&quot; therefore , how much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , is therefore not wanted to betra@@ y Al@@ hay . &quot;
&quot; only so much : &quot; &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; &quot; he finds . &quot;
&quot; also with its customers , the culinary international understanding is well received . &quot;
Met@@ cash launches campaign to combat Al@@ di@@ - collapse
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA stores from an Al@@ di rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholes@@ aler Met@@ cash has launched a ground@@ breaking campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia in advance of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di has prepared the opening of two distribution centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing via social media , as well as events like Adel@@ ai@@ de @-@ Show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A dealers and suppliers jump on board with brands such as ice manufacturers S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , distributed in I@@ GA stores and shop@@ keepers who sell endor@@ sed tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will publish more details of its defence strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment carries out its annual investors strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is much in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia accounts for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s I@@ GA stores and generate higher profit margins as Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the Eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to about 14 percent in Eastern countries . &quot;
&quot; however , analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe Al@@ di will grab some five percent of the food market in these two states twelve months after opening its first markets and take away all existing players but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this forecast is based on the assumption that Al@@ di will open 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; loss in food and food business and in quantities on Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost basis could cost Met@@ cash around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the Eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA purch@@ as@@ ers are the most loyal . &quot;
&quot; Morgan Stan@@ ley believes Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s will increase by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 , by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and reduce the market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of the Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , reported in a business lunch in Melbourne that Met@@ cash probably will disappear within a decade . &quot;
Met@@ cash declined to respond to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments publicly .
but it is assumed that a member of the board of Met@@ cash has contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; IG@@ AS &apos;s market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent since 2010 , and income from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s food and food trade , which supplies about 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , has declined by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting operational debt reduction with simultaneous print on sales and margins . &quot;
&quot; however , the wholes@@ aler rep@@ ents and inv@@ ests more than $ 150 million to balance selling prices with Col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week and to improve their stores with fast @-@ growing fresh foods and provide a better choice of private label food . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in 2017 , Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s CEO Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging rehabilitation programmes at El@@ an are hoping that the wholes@@ aler will return to profit again in 2017 for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian Tennis Association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behavior .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Cy@@ gios , and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserved praise as a cri@@ tique of his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented duo , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; got into the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght by the not@@ orious confrontation of Kyr@@ burg with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka at the Montreal Masters . &quot;
&quot; soon afterwards Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison calling out , &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have hit Kyr@@ burg , and I should hit the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp ended a potential US Open victory of Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the individual behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I &apos;m quite en@@ vious about is the fact that , in my opinion , Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn into the argument , &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost due to a cra@@ mp in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket from fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he has beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open , even among the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves a lot of recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strictly . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never had a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I believe he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to not consider Kyr@@ g@@ gios in the important preliminary decision which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he ass@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra to return as a long @-@ term fixed part in the team . &quot;
&quot; first of all , we want the team to be completely focused on the contest and not all around the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ burg &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he climbs in the eyes of the public and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I consider it fair , and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary explains emergency stand , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees &quot;
Hungary explains the state of emergency and negotiated the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held everyone who tried to go illeg@@ ally in the country . all with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
&quot; chaos followed the border , when hundreds of migrants settled in a No Man &apos;s land , and Ser@@ b officials responded with indignation . &quot;
&quot; the people who fled from violence were stuck for an unknown time in a strip on the road between the two control points of the countries , and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; as a police helicopter ho@@ vering over them , the migrants &quot; opened the border ! &quot; and cried insul@@ ts against the Hungarian pro@@ stitution police . &quot;
some returned from protest food and water .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister said it is &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece are arriving . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days , &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ences on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached no common immigration policy one day after the 28 @-@ member bloc at a meeting in Brussels .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share the responsibility for 40,000 people who sought refuge in the un@@ corrupted Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that the EU states would eventually receive more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria requested a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the immigration crisis of the continent .
&quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a spe@@ edy action of Brussels or from its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency shelter , which was launched on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and accelerate asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country is planning to build a bar@@ bed wire along its border with Romania , to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country - after ending a fence at the Serbian border . &quot;
&quot; C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent , Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata , reported that even prison in@@ mates were deployed during the race , the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia . &quot;
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a significant bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and an entry point to the European Union for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East . &quot;
&quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that most of the coming economic refugees are seeking a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view that is strongly opposed to other EU countries , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws that entered into force at midnight in Hungary make the crossing of the limit or damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) high fence that the government built along the southern border with Serbia , to a crime . these laws also impose higher sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation caused by mass mig@@ rations , the Hungarian government declares the state of emergency , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ porters in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still appro@@ ve the military deployment of the military , which is expected next week , but Re@@ porter from Associ@@ ated Press have seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs on the border . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that authorities saw 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country . &quot;
&quot; they come over by damaging the fence , they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes under new laws . &quot;
authorities are in the process of re@@ pairing the fence .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian civil servants included two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , after a train carriage with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos surrounded the most important border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to manipul@@ ate the data of people and press a crowd to squee@@ ze there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 succeeded in getting there , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the most important motorway link between Serbia and Hungary and said that they would refuse food and water until they are allowed to travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
&quot; the former Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton has continued to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins against her on the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the democratic vot@@ er in the pre @-@ elections ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders ranked second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ Chairman Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced whether he is candidates for the presi@@ dency , receives support of 15 percent of the democratic vot@@ er of the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion determines what candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their choice than that of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS news survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups , while S@@ anders earned some gains . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has a great advantage in women and moder@@ ates , but these projections were reduced . &quot;
&quot; their support in the men has dropped significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s advantage with democratic voters less than 50 years has van@@ ished , and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton has a great advantage over the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton was ahead of S@@ anders with a double @-@ digit margin in the liber@@ als , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries say they would support Clinton if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support them with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support them because they are the candi@@ ate .
they would not support six percent .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are especially enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who do not currently support Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the democratic voters in the prim@@ aries say they endor@@ se Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their Spitzen@@ kan@@ di@@ daten Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters in an open question are asked why they want it to be the candidate , the most common answer is that it has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters have also mentioned their connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
permission to deal with the problems and the voting are also quoted .
&quot; as the Vice President throws a potential for the presidential office into the scales , 57 percent of the voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic elec@@ tors of the pres@@ election are asked , who would be their second choice for the party , is Bi@@ den at the top . &quot;
&quot; of Clinton &apos;s followers say more than half , Bi@@ den would be their second choice far ahead of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to fight for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s lead is in front of S@@ anders , from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of democratic voters see Clinton as nomin@@ ee with the best chances to win the election , but this number dropped from 78 per cent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that regards it as the &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; is increased . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , on the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic elec@@ tors call questions about voting . &quot;
&quot; similarly , as in the last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate has emerged as unacceptable to these voters . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important characteristics in elec@@ ting the prim@@ aries of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities as honest and trust@@ worthy and endowed with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
Bi@@ den best cuts the three candidates with hon@@ esty when clin@@ ton &apos;s strength is the lead .
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not have an opinion of him . &quot;
&quot; democratic voters in general also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in accordance with their views . &quot;
&quot; in all these measurements , about a quarter of the democratic voters have no view of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server during the term of office as foreign minister continues to be placed , most Democratic vot@@ ers of the prim@@ aries are happy with their explanation of the matter and say that it did not affect their opinions . &quot;
but it &apos;s another story in the American public overall .
&quot; half of Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their explanation , while only about a third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion on this was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the email controversy had no effect on Clinton &apos;s overall opinions , although 36 percent said that their opinion still deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six of 10 who say their views have become worse by Clinton . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is regarded as honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this is still a problem for them under registered voters : only 32 percent see it as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 % of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voters across the country also see Tru@@ mp as being honest and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; Clinton and Tru@@ mp , however , receive good grades at leadership . &quot;
&quot; from the six candidates tested , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut off hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority sees differently than honestly , but as with Car@@ son many don &apos;t think of him . &quot;
the error rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters on the pres@@ election is 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp in a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son finds himself close behind Donald Tru@@ mp at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times survey
&quot; in the meantime , half of the voters support the two candidates in the new survey , and others are dramatically losing footh@@ old &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can vot@@ er continues to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers throughout the country . support grew from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey carried out last month prior to Fox News debate , at 27 % in the pol@@ l on Tuesday . &quot;
but Car@@ son rose from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups and sur@@ passes Tru@@ mp under republi@@ can elec@@ tors with higher education .
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio Gover@@ nor John Ka@@ sich , is beaten with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who is the lowest , and of 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida @-@ Senator Marco Ru@@ bio , are in third place with 6 % . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was conducted in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , which was published last week , shows that Car@@ son rises in the p@@ olls - he ends with 19 % support among the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the recent survey of ABC News / Washington Post also showed Tru@@ mp clearly before Car@@ son .
&quot; with a view of a Car@@ son rising in the last week , Tru@@ mp has found some side si@@ eves for the former neuro@@ sur@@ geons , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question tru@@ mp beliefs . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign show at I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers in order to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the north or the Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure at a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go into the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North Sea and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) . &quot;
&quot; bath temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean Sea : in the East , it even reaches up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a practicing ritual of a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges were lod@@ ged against five persons . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si brothers attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an initiation ceremony in September 2013 , and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been bur@@ dened with a 30 @-@ pound back@@ pack laden with sand , and repeatedly attacked while trying to reach a target via a frozen field . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ Fr@@ at@@ ernity did not call the emergency number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and allegedly waited for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gle his symptoms and contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood to get advice , said police chief Chris Wagner at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide utensils and basically set the welfare of the Brotherhood over that of Michael Den@@ g , &quot; said police chief Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning to his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added to the head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs with dul@@ ler force . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the sh@@ kan@@ ers of the Brotherhood . at least one student died of the ch@@ ic@@ ans every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer who represents D@@ eng@@ s &apos;s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ countable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for murder of the third rank for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to be responsible for the persons involved , but if there is an organization that has sanc@@ tioned - officially or in@@ officially - this , we will also hold them ac@@ countable , &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the national br@@ otherhood has rev@@ oked their affili@@ ation to the local group . &quot;
this will happen if the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; an interest increase comes , and the house will be sha@@ ken , returns for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we don &apos;t know is how long it will take and how long it will last .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
a recession came within only 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , though not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the Central Bank have so strongly emphasized that investors should not focus on when it starts to increase interest rates , but rather to the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; at the end , however , market participants could find out that the whole excitement might be exagger@@ ated because of interest increase . &quot;
&quot; the first rise in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean , however , that there will be no effect . &quot;
here is a look at historical trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , the anticip@@ ation of interest increases can make things volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; once the up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that returns from 12 to 24 months after the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said German @-@ Bank analysts in a recent study on what happened after interest increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more precisely , the market is usually in upward trend in the past 35 years - about 14 percent - on the way to the increase in interest , rather flat in the 250 days thereafter ( average profit of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a current analysis published by Bob Dol@@ l , chief asset strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
the Deutsche Bank said that the effects on the shares ten@@ den@@ ci@@ ally occur later in the increase cycle and the return therefore begins to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote them . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that were not before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
it is extremely remarkable that the gross domestic product is near its lowest point at an interest increase in the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , the 118 z@@ est increases since 1950 only accounted for twice the nominal GDP below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and forecast for the third quarter , according to the Atlanta F@@ ed , only 1.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; interest rates in a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question as to whether it &apos;s different this time , &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants have made the whole year prepared for a pay rise in the F@@ ed , and all eyes were directed at the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading is only a probability of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all increase cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ sh@@ es were put in the shade very quickly after the start of recovery , &quot; said the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest that the F@@ ed has been waiting since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months so far . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates interest in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is faster than in shares when they change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change direction as soon as the first up@@ li@@ ft@@ ment / decrease occurs in the cycle .
&quot; at the end of the development cycle , the bond issues fall immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
the strate@@ gi@@ sts of Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b believe that the increase in interest rates will result in yields between longer and shorter loans closer together and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; high @-@ interest bonds often result in better earnings in such a climate , although &quot; we are still cau@@ tious to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come @-@ Analysis at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; it is interesting , says Jones , that the markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy . &quot; &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve has increased , lending margins have expanded and volati@@ lity increased - all the characteristics of the market when the F@@ ed has sharpen@@ ed its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in large and large enterprises , which handle the greater part of their business operations in the United States , will benefit if interest rates rise and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multination@@ als with high debt are getting worse , as an increasing dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; &quot; quality &quot; &quot; shares tend to react extremely positively for three months following an initial interest rate , &quot; &quot; said Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; companies with strong balance sheet earned an average of 5 percentage points after each of the interest rate increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity in their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt is a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates will lose most , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside the pure share games , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers could see profits through higher yields , even if experts of different opinion are how fast this will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of the Classic FM , says Members of Parliament Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the conservative member of the parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ caster for its &quot; &quot; du@@ mm@@ ation &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not to be distinguished from commercial ri@@ vals .
he also quoted the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins attacked the Voice of The Voice , saying that this was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns &quot; into Classic FM , maintains a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the transmitter to prove that he does something that the private sen@@ ders do not . &quot;
&quot; Conserv@@ ative member Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC bos@@ ses , that the public @-@ legal radio station &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer be distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; sil@@ ly &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he also aimed at the BBC Music Awards which started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , launched last year , seem to be just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you try to do something else - these are two spontaneously mentioned examples , where you can actually im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; said Mr B@@ ingham . &quot;
BBC Director General dismissed the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of his commercial ri@@ vals when it comes to live music and inform@@ ing the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 I &apos;m nowhere to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there &apos;s a commitment to live music and music that is truly uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and commission new works , I also really consider important , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Controller Alan Dav@@ ey argued that tough@@ er had to work hard to get involved in the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; however , Radio 3 was not the only element of BBC production , which during the hearing in the Committee for the selection of culture , media , and sport came under fire to tramp@@ le on the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins seized The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was purchased from the Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for a cost of £ 22 million . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as judges - was produced in special BBC mode .
&quot; he added , he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable , &quot; &quot; when the next time it star@@ ed in an entertainment series . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to post@@ p@@ one the order of further ranks of The Voice in the future or to spend money in fee payments for other entertainment formats . &quot;
Internet sales slow@@ ed down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this .
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there was seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
&quot; last month , there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000 . &quot;
online sales strengthened three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe Black Friday has slow@@ ed the issues in November
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost towns . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there is now signs that online sales stagn@@ ate , after new numbers only revealed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
the total expenditure for August presented the lowest increase in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new numbers only showed 7 percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you consider the growth rates for the previous years and go back up to 2000 , that has always been developing over time , &quot; &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales directory to the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers started making purchases with their mobile phone purchases . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now this comm@@ its itself , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing . &quot;
the Black Friday phenomenon imported from America is quoted as a reason for re @-@ sending sales .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will with@@ hold their purchases before this event , which takes place on the last Friday of November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealers websites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe Black Friday , in which the buyers fought for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found out that £ 5 spent a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; in some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of the purchases are now carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than one quarter of people buy clothing and shoes online rather than in the fashion chains in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca near the crane accident - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 deaths are carried by Muslims in the first fun@@ er@@ als in Mec@@ ca by the streets
Saudi Arabia ow@@ es the collapse of some of the vast Sau@@ dis Bin Laden Group to the burden
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane crashed &quot;
hundreds of Muslims gathered themselves when 29 of the victims were carried through the streets to bury those who were killed as a crane in Mec@@ ca &apos;s grand@@ mo@@ z@@ ee collap@@ sed .
&quot; mour@@ ning filled , dressed mostly in white , the track to pay off their respect when the first of the dead began their last trip to the Al @-@ Mo@@ renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral procession passed by the Holy Place , where only days before a building crane le@@ aded through the ceiling of the mosque and then on the beds . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ ses were released for burial , when the Saudi King donated a san@@ ction to the building company of Bin Laden &apos;s family bin Laden for the catastrophe that also left 3@@ 94 wounded . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ ses of 29 beds , who were killed as a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mosque of Mec@@ ca , were carried through the streets . &quot;
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , father of four children , who was on his first pilgrimage to support the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the start of the annual H@@ add@@ sch in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officers have already stated , that the p@@ add@@ ling to Mec@@ ca with thousands still coming to the city will continue . &quot;
&quot; today , King Sal@@ man said that the bin Laden group would not have stopped the arm of the crane when he was not used . &quot;
a Arabic version of the decree issued by the State Saudi Press Agency said that the bin Laden Group was in charge of the collapse .
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the management of the company abroad was prohibited . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man wanted to reveal what caused the overthrow of the crane , which fell into an inner courtyard of the large mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were gathered in front of the H@@ add@@ sch , which was later held this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden Group has not published any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for an opinion . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also t@@ elled the group because of not up @-@ to @-@ date security measures and because it did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
&quot; dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka &apos;s major mosque as part of the massive building project , which is managed by the bin Laden Group . &quot;
the bin Laden &apos;s family has been connected to the Saudi Arabia &apos;s family for decades and takes over larger construction projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came amid strong winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the kingdom for the pilgrimage , which is at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims . &quot;
officials said that 158 people were hospit@@ alized .
government officials ordered that one million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) to be paid to relatives of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other players will receive half of this amount .

&quot; if you are skil@@ ful to deal with a hammer or brush for painting walls , you seem to be a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; since British employ more and more arti@@ sans to do DIY jobs in their homes , the boss of the company is behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who owns the DIY chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled arti@@ sans from Eastern Europe , who offer services at low prices , has now over@@ taken . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher is planning to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix Shops , which are aimed at craftsmen and 60 sales points from B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wants to deal more women in B &amp; Q shops , because eight of ten buying decisions in the store are hit by women . &quot;
&quot; at the moment , the men were out@@ weighing the men . &quot;
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that have more female single households that do more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men working in our branches .
we have to shift this to a balance .
&quot; basically , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on buying articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , one of only five women listed at the top of a British in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 index , has also re@@ structured their top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company that has staff@@ ed just 50 percent of the team with women , including its management and Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important issue here . &quot;
it was not difficult to find good women for our supervisory board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a decline in half @-@ year profit and sales after the group failed to reduce the cost of closing the shut@@ ters .
&quot; because of the trends , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores . &quot;
function@@ aries of A@@ ich / D@@ ob because of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity to court
&quot; on Wednesday , two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball vice @-@ master A@@ ich / D@@ ob have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and de@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them had also been accused of abuse of office .
&quot; from this accus@@ ation , he was finally acqu@@ itted in May . &quot;
the current process was postpon@@ ed .
&quot; according to the prosec@@ utor Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary examination revealed that the defend@@ ants in 2006 and 2011 were free of funds from the association accounts which they were allowed to operate in their functions , for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; the damage is estimated at around 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted for financial off@@ ences .
&quot; this fact eliminated the chair@@ woman of the Sho@@ v@@ eller Senate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it shall be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the accus@@ ation of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the Defence argued that at no point in time the association had developed an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports function@@ aries would only have charged expenses and the sports club for which they had been operating from 1982 to 2011 and in which they had invested a lot of time and money , out of debt - the pas@@ siv@@ ity amounted to some 600@@ ,000 sh@@ ill@@ ings in 2001 ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at that time , we were confronted with the situation : do we carry on or stop the club ? &quot; &quot; said one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ basket of the audi@@ tor of the financial office . &quot;
he then decided to take over this task with his colleague and co @-@ defend@@ ant .
with all risks .
&quot; we have treas@@ ured money , put our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said at the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there must be no debt . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in case of appropriate financial success , the withdrawal of the allowance for expenses had been decided retro@@ actively by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one has paid off a portion of the allowance for years later , namely from the year 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; therefore , flat @-@ l@@ ump and not detail @-@ offs were also appearing , the former chairman explained the proceedings . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ us administr@@ ated the two defend@@ ants in common , said the second defend@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed to the association in detail , the judge asked . &quot;
&quot; the association has not been interested in detail for financial sponsorship , important is only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; as in 2011 against the one functional investigation due to official abuse , an amount of 120@@ .000 euros was transferred to the association &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were appropri@@ ations , the defend@@ ants declared . &quot;
&quot; this bank account ran to the name of the second defend@@ ant , and , according to the statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he finally said he believed that this was the best for the club .
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything about this money , the prosec@@ utor asked in the room . &quot;
&quot; the co @-@ defend@@ ant had been informed , the function@@ ary justified himself . &quot;
&quot; this transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; claim compensation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why compensation ? , wanted to know judge and prosec@@ utor . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant stated that he did not agree with this formulation , because the association has never produced any damage . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says : &quot; &quot; with that you are all from the tailor . &quot;
&quot; am I a legal representative ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never purchased a cent salary , he only charged mil@@ eage and diets . &quot;
&quot; he charged EUR 1,000 per month to diets , but the actual expenditure would have been much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not able to present accurate documents for the early years .
&quot; they were no longer kept up after an operational check , in which everything had been judged correctly , they explained . &quot;
Mil@@ o@@ dom@@ eter had also referred to the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all the adjustments were made in cash , so he had to travel to the Bank to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence from the international market , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the trial will continue on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard st@@ alls more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the staff cuts that have been ongoing for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ esis will cut off additional jobs in the company &apos;s split . &quot;
the pitch functions of the US @-@ Compu@@ terri@@ fic H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs in its corporate customer segment . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs in the amount of USD 2.@@ 7 billion ( 2.4 billion euros ) are to be saved , the company informed on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special load of around 2.7 billion dollars , which will start in the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the reduction of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the financial year 2013 / 14 , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates . &quot;
the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard earnings share remained 2.3 percent below the exchange rate .
&quot; the company , which grew up with printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , currently divi@@ des itself : this is how the computer and print business will be bund@@ led in a new society - separate from the most promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand for corporate customers after its services put the world &apos;s second @-@ largest PC manufacturer to the latest in the world .
&quot; in the third quarter of the financial year at the end of July , sales of PC and printers fell by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to almost 25.@@ 4 billion dollars .
the proceeds went back in 15 out of 16 quarters .
HP answers with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ missions on the change in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has only recently re@@ acted to the fact that customers increasingly buy smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and do more and more shops online .
&quot; Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans in total envis@@ age the reduction of roughly 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports the anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; a direct involvement of German soldiers in combat operations in Iraq would , however , mainly result in rejection : 54 percent responded by contrast , 35 percent agreed . &quot;
the fact that other states are flying air@@ strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
&quot; on the other hand , 24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; together with the Syrian leader Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , 51 percent of the respon@@ dents reject , 20 per cent would be . &quot;
29 per cent were not able to decide .
car : second press @-@ day at the 6@@ 6th IAA
&quot; the focus of the fair will be on connected , self @-@ driving cars and e @-@ mobility by 27 September . &quot;
&quot; after two days of press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Automobile Exhibition under the motto &quot; Mobility &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the general public can visit the IAA from Saturday .
&quot; like two years ago , the organisers of the V@@ DA car association reck@@ on with some 900 000 visitors . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violent erup@@ tion on Hungarian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police deployed several hundred displaced refugees at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke Tr@@ än@@ eng@@ as and the water@@ lights .
&quot; the Euron@@ ews report , D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k , has witnessed the out@@ burst of violence at the border control point . &quot;
he reported on the phone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen a water @-@ thro@@ wer was ready .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees began throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially stopped pe@@ pper@@ mint .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now moved back somewhat .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
children who had breath@@ ed the tear gas cried out .
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by the use of tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US central bank
&quot; the world ob@@ serves when the US bank@@ note comes together two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest is raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found out that a little more than half that the F@@ ed would do , now thinks that the F@@ ed will continue to pers@@ ist for a little longer and keep interest rates at the current level of 0 - 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it is seven years since the F@@ ed interest set on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we are approaching a situation where a large central bank may possibly leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ isation of interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bide , managing employee at the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the US economy is based on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less gru@@ es@@ ome outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to adjust to an increase , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 8 : 00 PM CE@@ T on Thursday
&quot; death shake at Delta State University , leaving ap@@ ology writing &quot;
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he later shot his colleague and killed - Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to tell him that he &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; at the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; he could undo it , &quot; &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that Lamb , Lec@@ turer for Ge@@ ography and Social Science Education at Delta State University , called the emergency number at 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said that he had shot on someone , and he was put to death . &quot;
lamb said to the staff of the emergency call centre that police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife last night &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; cute dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; nobody will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably will be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police asked the c@@ aller about his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
Lamb did not give any explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police came to the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , who said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
&quot; I loved A@@ my , and she is the only woman who loved me ever . &quot;
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb travelled 300 miles to Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen changed him . &quot;
&quot; University President William La@@ for@@ ge said he didn &apos;t know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs idea . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday that Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday , there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; triangle relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was described by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but stayed friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss would have a daughter who is 19 , and she is &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
&quot; Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss , who owned a dog named Light@@ ning , met with Lamb for about three years . &quot;
&quot; she wanted to help other people , &quot; &quot; Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said that Lamb had ph@@ oned relatives at a certain time on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He does not go to prison . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen pick him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
&quot; in spring 2015 , Lamb received a Ph@@ .@@ D. from the Delta State University , as his CV on the University &apos;s website . &quot;
stars who lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 he fought against leu@@ ka@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long @-@ term partner , Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also allegedly has to fight with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this safely calls for its tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
the Lufthansa plans a major restructuring of the Group .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the around 1,000 executives around the world will cost the workplace . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
Lufthansa is expanding its corporate structure and vali@@ dates the Euro@@ wings budget .
&quot; the aim of the real@@ ignment is a contribution to earnings of around 500 million euros per year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline informed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , there will be no more board in the future for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the low @-@ cost airline Euro@@ wings should be developed as intr@@ insi@@ cally as possible .
in the management team headed by chief Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in future .
&quot; with the real@@ ignment , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group plans to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; so far , the organization of the 120 000 employees has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines operate under the roof of the Passage Air@@ line Group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with pilots
&quot; in the collective bar@@ gaining agreement with the pilot agreement cockpit ( VC ) , negotiations shall be resum@@ ed on this Thursday after the court stopped . &quot;
that divided the union with .
the theme of the talks is to be the resting place control for pilots .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in a year with a projected record result , &quot; &quot; cockpit wool &quot; &quot; wants to achieve viable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between the union and the airline carried out several strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the background is the &quot; Wings &quot; as@@ par@@ ag@@ us concept . &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , Lufthansa is planning routes to the Group &apos;s own cheap airline Euro@@ wings . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w from Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ ture
Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg at the Champions League defeat of Manchester at the PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven .
&quot; while this brought the left external defender to cry and shut him off for at least six months of playing , Louis van Ga@@ al does not give the hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 @-@ year @-@ old sha@@ w had collap@@ sed into the PS@@ V area .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being taken to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s terrible - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then fantastic plays , and then it happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I am not a doctor but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then the six months , and he will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed happy to have escaped a Red Card and the Sus@@ pension of an El@@ f@@ eter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the refer@@ ee , did not punish the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator was wrong .
you can judge for yourself if I say that a mo@@ ck@@ yard and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack with both legs .
&quot; a tweet at Sha@@ ws account was : &quot; I thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken I am , my way to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w in defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has added an additional incentive to recover until the coming of June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to violate any opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van Ga@@ al Holland Team at the World Cup in 2014 .
&quot; he is very difficult , because it was not his intention to hurt his opponent , and if you hear it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball moving in another direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said , &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very ill with it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also taken to the hospital - after a play by Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron is better known as the Lor@@ ax ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents learn soon : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long before you know it almost by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child care systems to name his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Minister @-@ President ruled for The Lor@@ ax , which appeared in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , Mr Cameron writes in a message on the site of the company Super@@ Camp@@ s , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book I like to read my children , as it always seems to give a picture or message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all beautiful and good except that the following paragraph , in which Mr Cameron re@@ port@@ edly describes the story of the book , instead re @-@ releases an index of the 2012 movie version , adding new characters and details to extend the rather short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where all nature went and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; as if this wasn &apos;t yet enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax movie , which is presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and so begins : &quot; in the walled city of Th@@ need @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy named T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to being a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
&quot; most likely , such a relatively low PR task was deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who didn &apos;t read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row . &quot;
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s Ele@@ ction Office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp@@ s confirmed that the text of Mr Cameron &apos;s staff was delivered , but there were no further direct comments . &quot;
&quot; Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the exclusion from England &apos;s team , but it is still difficult &quot;
&quot; encounter@@ ing Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if you see the cad@@ res you chose England for the tour , a repeat of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my card . &quot;
I would not make an out@@ going win .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks side may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they will not bear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ bow@@ ler and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if he is an unknown quantity on test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
related news : Adam Ly@@ th is leaving the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire , difficult to analyse . &quot;
&quot; with its seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , there - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully kno@@ cks off more shopping for Yor@@ k@@ shire , another chance comes . &quot;
&quot; the British coach Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude even if he didn &apos;t get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a Test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th received seven chances - like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out@@ wards .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation that one can raise was that England first set up Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost chance is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he is a drummer , whom I set up high . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , which we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he finished 2@@ 36 against us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same odds as those before him , but this depends , of course , on the position of man in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to suggest mos@@ ques beside Cook , what an extra spin @-@ bow@@ ler would perform and four squ@@ e@@ aks would get , aw@@ ed , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ handed has already shown that he is a Cri@@ cket player . &quot;
&quot; mos@@ ques may not have done his job for his county Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is a number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop before he appeared as an op@@ ener in 2001 .
&quot; he made three hundred edges immediately , and did not look back . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari comes in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited way of dealing with him , he impressed me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a pun@@ t , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has made some clever additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test matches could be a masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experience as he has played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood arrives for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application into the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh air in the changing cub@@ icle , even if the messages are in line with what has been said before . &quot;

the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = Great Britain out of the EU ) could gain momentum when the economy starts a slu@@ gg@@ ish in 2017
&quot; David Cameron &apos;s un@@ challenged New Deal strategy to keep Britain in the EU is getting deeper with each day , even without the choice of brilliant Jerem@@ y &quot; Is it yes or no ? &quot; Cor@@ by@@ n to the leader of Labour or the TU@@ C , who fought hard for Europe on Tuesday . &quot;
foreigners also have their Cor@@ by@@ ns and Ni@@ gel Far@@ ages .
&quot; a European diplom@@ acy enthusi@@ ast recently said that some member states , as deeply ent@@ angled in various crises , such as the EU , are now and not always full of their own guilt , Britain itself created agenda with split concessions and disrup@@ tive amendments that they mostly don &apos;t want . &quot;
in Bri@@ gh@@ ton the TU@@ C decided at its annual meeting that it does not like it if they je@@ op@@ ardi@@ ze social protection .
we could also call it Dave and Georges Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ Agenda .
&quot; Prime Minister and Minister of Finance are climbing at summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , making a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always about me .
&quot; my European friend , who wishes to be looking outside Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; &quot; Let &apos;s not leave us alone with France , &quot; &quot; Berlin says - and let us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come up to the point where they don &apos;t care if we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; Germany &apos;s cau@@ tious Chancellor Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as in the over@@ run long endurance such as T@@ hat@@ cher ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande is looking for his re @-@ election or replacement in 2017 .
he is also a f@@ ading force .
&quot; Poland possibly soon has a nation@@ alist right government , Spain a left . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will tear a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie Brit@@ ons , whose energy should be better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they don &apos;t want because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st trends have . &quot;
&quot; that is why some such ministers may deliberately not plan helpful comments , entirely in SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s referendum campaign is in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process , my friend susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; and &quot; Britain has won nothing of value from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; Europeans know how predat@@ or@@ ically the Fle@@ et street can be at their cost , and which EU scep@@ tic is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one as they did during the 1975 referendum , inspired by Tony Ben@@ n , which supported our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the Er@@ z @-@ euro opport@@ uni@@ sts who made a name for himself as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ade ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; with all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this included the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone h@@ acking foreigners and the pseudo @-@ countries that most of our big newspapers have . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similar about them , but noticed that when you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , better ban@@ anas are distributed to distra@@ ct him instead of getting his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more Bla@@ i@@ ri@@ ans than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had the principle of the non @-@ approved EU constitution which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never even forgiven him .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly flap on my back on Monday in Westminster - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time to waste me - seems at risk to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch Strategy of the 1980s , a mistake then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r whose BBC @-@ settee he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position on Europe is - I express it friendly - in the development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; now , most people outside U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blu@@ e@@ berry @-@ tendency and the wild herds of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ism can say yes to everyone . &quot;
&quot; it is what Hil@@ ary &quot; &quot; Ein Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and on TV this week said , when the boy@@ sc@@ outs fought in him , not ad@@ mitting that Cor@@ by@@ ns nom@@ ination of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70@@ &apos;@@ er years when his old father tried to be il@@ loyal to his cabinet colleagues , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s fight was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to stay &quot; &quot; under all circumstances &quot; &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey - remember that he even touched me - news @-@ discipline is important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding ground of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it is right to give Cameron no free map for Europe , which allows him to keep lab@@ ours support in the referendum campaign for a matter of course , as Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins thinks for sure .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ ns fundamental ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ es Siege Economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a question of es@@ ot@@ eric debate among left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with its ambig@@ u@@ ities towards Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is firmly convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit , foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have suspi@@ cious voters - to make concessions to the British when all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ?
&quot; the US has already been pretty disappointed with the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a cost reduction of the T@@ ory government in power , which I reminded on the start on Monday of something that was called British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise Public Health England &apos;s report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ financed agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with connections to the tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et joined in by critici@@ zing Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; Basic Report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers have questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month resor@@ ted to the &quot; extraordinarily wind@@ y basis &quot; on which P@@ he founded his most important conclusion .
two more researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims &quot; build on stone or sand . &quot;
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool said : &quot; &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on evidence of effectiveness . &quot;
they said the public expected that the claim of P@@ he that &quot; the current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; based on a detailed review of evidence and modeling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single session of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) in order to bring their opinions on the damage of different ni@@ cot@@ ine @-@ containing products into a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ arized in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously been received by British American Tob@@ acco Media ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also signed the testim@@ onials of BA@@ T for public health in a sustainability report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared to receive funds from an e @-@ cigar@@ ettes manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to receive according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the board members are not supplied , but there are several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
&quot; at the meeting , the Tob@@ acco Control of P@@ he was also part of the meeting . &quot;
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; conf@@ ers signs &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; hard evidence for most products in most of the criteria , &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these connections or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that the claims of P@@ he that &quot; there has been no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes used to be a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; were premature .
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , director of health and well being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims had already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking . &quot;
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies in his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are minor compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; P@@ he has the clear duty to inform the public about what evidence proves and what is not , especially if there is so much public confusion about the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people die of a disease each year with regards to smoking , and smoking will cost the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; by pointing out current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the damage caused by smoking , we fulfill our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former CEO of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said the BBC should stop sending programs like East@@ ern@@ ader and The Voice . he said commercial ri@@ vals would give their right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the broadcasting charge should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters .
&quot; he critici@@ zed BBC for making public @-@ legal programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , in hard controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and broad@@ cast@@ ers like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC general director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said that for six years in his time with Channel 4 he tried to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programs are commissioned or broad@@ cast@@ ed , which would also clearly be shown by un@@ subsidi@@ zed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Upper House Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the broadcasting charge , which I do not consider medium or long @-@ term for a good idea , you should at least rely on programs that others do not make or commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to reach a wide range of support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it is of course non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax program is funded , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ ern@@ ader is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm . &quot;
I &apos;m trying to see how this should be public @-@ legal TV .
I don &apos;t think this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series , who headed Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for ratings &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe that this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on the most popular broad@@ casts of the BBC show what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart talk in Edinburgh in 2003 , that the BBC shows like East@@ er@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal niche programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks , and they can argue if they go on their seem@@ ing missions to justify 4 billion pounds broadcasting fees , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
&quot; Johnson said to the committee : &quot; &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions , who can get the best value here . &quot;
&quot; of course , you all think that for 150 £ a year you get a great value here , but for people who are a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if this is true , because they don &apos;t consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the Committee on Tuesday , demanded that the BBC should check its Rei@@ thi@@ an Mission , &quot; &quot; inform@@ ing , educ@@ ating , and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said , only little from BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said that it was 1 % of their TV production and 0,1 % on the radio - and it should take an example to the public television stations in Australia and Canada , for example , to &quot; inform , clear up and enter@@ tain . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful of television are shown , and with the commercial channels to make alliances in order to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have grown worms with genetically modified nervous systems which can be controlled by break@@ through@@ s of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction at the moment in which they reson@@ ate with sound impulses that have high frequencies for the human hearing to be heard .
&quot; the impulses work through switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that respond to ultras@@ onic waves . &quot;
more on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ ograms , which can be used in ultrasound to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , said the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , an invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people to treat symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; flat@@ worms do not usually react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani found that they did it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which penetrate into the worms . &quot;
the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures that are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels and found in the membranes of some of the worms .
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani modified the worms in such a way that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ ones carry TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels . &quot;
&quot; when ultras@@ oun@@ ds are applied to the altered creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms where they switch on the changed motor neur@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground@@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; contrary to light , which has to be sent down to the desired place in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can happen un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from the top of the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that gene therapy and a therapeutic virus may make it possible to temporarily vulnerable human neur@@ ons for the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved to a student residence still in the faith of Ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se smile of those whom I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , long @-@ leg@@ ged complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled into eight simple rules .
the entrance into student residence halls ranges from slightly annoying to absolutely terri@@ fying .
&quot; it &apos;s temp@@ ting to chat : people tell wh@@ ence you come from , whether and where you &apos;ve taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand with regards to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you &quot; &quot; honestly said Mar@@ m@@ ite neither love nor hate because in ear@@ nest , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I &apos;m in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you find out the people you like in contrast to those with whom you wouldn &apos;t speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burning and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people &apos;s rooms are often transformed into drinks reception , film night venues and municipal meeting points , but they are also places where people wear and pay their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : do not remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted are given a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student residence halls form a space @-@ to @-@ space stroll culture that is friendly and social and can lead to lifel@@ ong friend@@ ships . &quot;
this can be hell for someone who tries to recover .
&quot; nothing in cultivation allows you to say , &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy I have used for interaction with you . &quot;
try to feel whenever a fellow student is exhausted by soci@@ ability - and send him an SMS instead of attacking .
speaking of kno@@ cking : do it .
a guy in my student dormit@@ ories had the idea that a closed door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
friend@@ ships close by che@@ eks .
&quot; since you start the university at the height of back @-@ man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present themselves with a plate full of brow@@ ni@@ es is less wei@@ rd than welcome the 1950 @-@ s &quot; Welcome to the neighborhood , I made you a bit baked . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to make friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel oblig@@ ated to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; badly mixed lum@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat will cause people to get sleep@@ y when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residence halls .
&quot; of course , the c@@ law of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; the chances are good that they say to serve themselves , even if they are cooking inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying and you have my compassion - but try to deal more balanced as my room@@ mate , who added a deterg@@ ent to her milk to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in prison .
they should not make any noise that prevents people from sleep or from work .
&quot; it is not only about being a decent person , but that you belong to the tru@@ est sense of the saying to the people sitting in the glas@@ sh@@ ouse . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my hall@@ way asked her neighbors if it &apos;s a bit qui@@ eter to them , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more lu@@ ke@@ warm music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly left her neighbours to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three hour test . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse happened to move into the same student residence ?
&quot; on the other hand , it would not be deep embarrass@@ ing if you hold a room@@ mate for your future marriage partner , go to her , separate herself and see her every day and perhaps experience how she pul@@ ls together all together friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes his own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , at least try to convince your body a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has his keys in his un@@ locked room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and M@@ ob@@ bing is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good punch is funny , but it takes only moments when it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
place a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security by hiding - but never mind someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
&quot; shut down your door , and place your keys in a glass of water , which you will put into the freezer - but don &apos;t t@@ oss their possessions on the ceiling more than twice . &quot;
&quot; town@@ houses for Refu@@ ge@@ es , Only @-@ Educ@@ ators , S@@ ear@@ ners &quot;
the real estate entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner builds row houses for people who don &apos;t have much money in the Central Fran@@ con@@ ian Eck@@ ental holiday homes .
&quot; for example , for refugees - but also as a signal : &quot; not only refugees need a living space , but also the only educ@@ ating mother and the ear@@ ners . &quot;
&quot; I &apos;ll show you how to build cheap and good today , &quot; says the 44 @-@ year @-@ old in an interview . &quot;
thousands of refugees will be forced to enter the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner expects to know how fast affordable housing can be created : he builds houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
what solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for people remain a great part here .
&quot; in view of the influ@@ x of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ story town@@ house is the solution . &quot;
guil@@ d : a town@@ house needs the least space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different from the people living in blocks .
&quot; each of the six homes , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers each . &quot;
&quot; each apartment has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it can be that many refugees say it is again peace , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what are the costs ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house amounts to 18@@ 4 000 euros , without land . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
the construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complic@@ ate their plans ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : &quot; &quot; legally , I went through my project correctly . &quot;
especially complicated it always makes the im@@ pending Dam@@ o@@ kl@@ es@@ sch@@ wert special construction and the Stell@@ platz@@ l Ord@@ in@@ ance .
sp@@ ook@@ y .
&quot; it is still under@@ lined who creates three apartments in a row house , needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities is the place missing .
and refugees and asylum seekers do not have cars .
how did the residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : there were some who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers . &quot;
which is definitely not true .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true , however , we had a construction boom in Germany over the past five years , but we built luxury apartments that can hardly afford one more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , as well as ordinary people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the only educ@@ ating mother or the ear@@ ners . &quot;
I show you can still build cheap and good today .
that is what it is about .

iOS 9 : how to get the new iPhone OS when Apple update is released
&quot; the new operating system can be requested by going to the setup app , click &quot; &quot; General &quot; &quot; and then &quot; &quot; Software Update &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when it is ready , the phone gives you the option to download and then to install . &quot;
&quot; some have encountered problems after the installation , as they get an error message telling that the &quot; software update is missing . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to b@@ ypass the problem , users are advised to either wait until the ons@@ lau@@ ght goes back or attempt to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .
&quot; this may result in del@@ eting apps to create space - but Apple has made it more likely due to the sli@@ mming of the update . likewise , it will be easier to do this if you use a special tool to delete apps and then re @-@ install them as soon as the process is finished . &quot;
&quot; it is worth making sure that your mobile phone is charged while updating or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue , as the phone might turn down half way and this could lead to a demo@@ lition of the update . &quot;

&quot; the Schach@@ club &quot; Schach@@ freunde Bad Kis@@ singen , &quot; which was founded three months ago , has added another member to its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot;

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation which chairman Alfred Klein accepted .
&quot; thus , it is possible to include chess players who cannot afford the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search are also to be pushed forward .

district office is looking for direct contact
&quot; both Sal@@ u@@ dis and Anton@@ isti@@ ans@@ und Old People &apos;s Centre have put together under the man@@ hood of the social foundation , and opened a new stop at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz . &quot;
&quot; besides consulting , one can also take part in courses there . &quot;
the social foundation runs down from the mountain to the city centre .
more precisely to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
a new district office was recently opened there .
&quot; from now on , right next to the shopping market , senior citizens and credit rating agencies receive information on questions such as health care insurance or health care insurance benefits . &quot;
for years we have established ourselves with our ambul@@ atory care service that often care@@ gi@@ vers are left alone .
there are so many questions .
&quot; many services of the insur@@ ances are not rarely used because the complexity of the insur@@ ances is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ans@@ und Bürger@@ rat@@ ital as well as for the ambul@@ atory service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as storm prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy treatment can be used . &quot;
the offers from the senior center and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior center for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the opening of the new district offices in the city centre , both business leaders are particularly looking for demographic change . &quot;
because this is a good de@@ central infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
&quot; in addition , as mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined during the inauguration celebrations , the Qu@@ arti@@ stes office also dedic@@ ates itself to the balancing act in old age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able supplement . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the social foundation makes a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live as independently and well in their familiar environment . &quot;
&quot; the district office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tuesday and Thursday from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

&quot; witnesses visit the police for a incident in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on the way to Sal@@ mün@@ ster on foot from Bad So@@ den . &quot;
&quot; one out of the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , followed by the police his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at this point the group was at the level of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three people on the premises of the gas station .
one of these men now shou@@ ted to the young people and struck them with their fist .
the victim suffered a nas@@ al rup@@ ture and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .

Dr. Frank Müller takes on field breaks and inv@@ ests € 3@@ 10@@ 000
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) take over the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen .
&quot; the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also happy about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : Dr. Frank Müller will take over the practice by Dr. Frank Müller on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen is reti@@ ring , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still standing at half a point in the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller opened the practice on 12 October , until then he invested 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us Street 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight when the ri@@ ms encountered Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who are currently completing their training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and also wants to enter into practice this year . &quot;
&quot; we always had the mind that the mil@@ ler would fit into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was time , I simply ph@@ oned her . &quot;
the Müller couple liked the idea to operate their own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old Müller . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
&quot; as an advantage , he also sees his own boss . &quot;
and so we agreed that the mil@@ ler bought the house with the practice .
&quot; however , they continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up there , his medical studies in Hanover followed stations in several medical practices as well as in the hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently working as a senior physician in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed a senior resident in Di@@ ep@@ holz and is engaged in voluntary work in the German Democratic Forces of Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from September 19 , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; while Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ ce@@ ausen is a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( Intern@@ acional ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the Müll@@ ers , both intern@@ s , want to settle down as a house doctor . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l . &quot;
&quot; after the reconstruction , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and load @-@ bearing EK@@ Gs and need a talk room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; at a subsi@@ dy of 50,000 euros , the mil@@ ler will receive a subsi@@ dy programme ( 25@@ 000 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are that the practice is continued , &quot; emphas@@ ises Chief Apostle Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , about 2000 patients come into the practice of Fel@@ ce@@ ausen per quarter , in the northern German average practice there are about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another doctor &apos;s office .
a positive side effect of the practice by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ ce@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no follow@@ er had found himself , then she would have gone . &quot;
&quot; who visits Müll@@ ers consultation hours , inci@@ dentally also looks especially in familiar faces : takes over the seven medical specialists and the cleaning power from the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; their departure ends in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the medical profession has practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel Fel@@ lows recalls smiling . &quot;
&quot; a little melanch@@ oly , after a long time , already felt . &quot;
&quot; but we still live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will surely see many patients &quot; , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; her husband adds : &quot; &quot; we have a 6,000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far , I &apos;ve always pressed myself in front of gardening , now that could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and likes to travel . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; we are leaving the refugees by &quot;
&quot; now border controls are also ramp@@ ed up at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border are maintained in parallel .
&quot; as before , it is clear that everyone who wants to submit an asylum request can do so naturally . &quot;
the emphasis is on the care and safety of the people .
&quot; but it is clear that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; people need to know that we do not accept bor@@ der@@ less migration flows , even beyond the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia is considering &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia refuses
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia would also allow arriving refugees in the direction of Austria and Germany , and under certain circumstances set up corri@@ dors for refugees . &quot;
&quot; the Minister of Interior , Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar , did not see such a situation in Lai@@ bach either . &quot;
&quot; the idea of corri@@ dors &quot; absolutely unacceptable , &quot; Slovenia would rather intensi@@ fy the monitoring of the border , especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer boundary of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the Minister stressed , Slovenia wants to limit its borders to refugees but not bars . &quot;
&quot; each EU member must complete its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government said , the first refugees had already tried in the night @-@ hours on Tuesday to leave in eastern Croatia at the border crossing T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could pick them up in the nearby corn fields .
&quot; according to local media , police vehicles are constantly entering police vehicles with new refugees in the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik . &quot;
&quot; it is mainly about Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country accounts for about 4,000 refugees , said Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo on the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which until now had brought migrants to the Hungarian border , would diver@@ t towards Croatia , reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was to suggest people to take certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do so , &quot; it meant . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , a first bus with around 50 refugees in the Serbian border town of S@@ id arrived in the morning , in the course of the day more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the passengers were travelling all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was about 500 kilometres away from Serbia . &quot;
&quot; we heard that Hungary has admitted , so the police said that we should travel here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel further to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the postpon@@ ed postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could actually reach a somewhat further west road . &quot;
Croatia : &quot; comprehensive capabilities for border control &quot;
Croatia &apos;s interior minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had previously stressed that his country has prepared corresponding plans for the fall of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not call for details , but he pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; comprehensive capabilities for border control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
conduct strict controls to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have since passed a good report to the country as far as the standard of border controls is concerned . &quot;
&quot; on Serbian side , about 300 refugees are still stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade media reports , they had spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees wish to continue travelling to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian Interior Minister N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic still tried to so@@ ot@@ he Wednesday at a local note in Hor@@ gos : he held the debates on alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would not currently act for very high numbers of refugees .
&quot; one cannot yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or another country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already started distributing maps on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not safe : in parts of the border area there are still 20 years after the end of the Croatia War still not cleared min@@ e@@ fields . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clean@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;

&quot; according to the investig@@ ators , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched . &quot;

&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went through the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is also available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as for questions and discussions as the volunteer staff .
&quot; while some of the pass@@ ant @-@ by spontaneously acc@@ esses the circle and &quot; be@@ j@@ ected my life , &quot; &quot; can read , &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; or &quot; not suffer for a long time , &quot; others remain short , read , say pro@@ positions like &quot; &quot; so far I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;

&quot; however , it is understandable that not everyone wants to communicate publicly on the boards , but it is a very personal thing . &quot;

&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex result shu@@ ff@@ led , financial outlook for 2016 lowered &quot;
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery giant lowered his profit outlook for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for the holiday . &quot;
&quot; at this time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by 2.5 percent in the pre @-@ market trade 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. An@@ no@@ un@@ ces to earn a profit between 10,@@ 40 $ and 10,@@ 90 $ in the financial year that will end in May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected a survey of Fac@@ t@@ Set 10.@@ 84 $ according to a survey .
&quot; the lower view comes despite the price increases , which amount to an average of 4.@@ 9 percent and will be effective on 4 January and , despite higher elev@@ ations for body@@ board transport of heavy and large packages , which will be collected from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would be increased compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and growth in online retail . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that &quot; the Company gains &quot; solid income if you consider the weaker as expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; plans for holiday employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to employ 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter that ended on August 31 , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned $ 6@@ 92 million , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;

&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international priority shipping , which brought the sales in its unit Express shipment to the St@@ ag@@ ain@@ ing . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping has increased the results of F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , volume sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat because of higher costs for larger packages and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the Express unit recorded higher revenue due to higher prices , while the result declined due to higher labor costs in freight business . &quot;
&quot; in the pre @-@ market trade , about an hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares fell by 3.@@ 85 $ , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they concluded with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent below a record high on June 11 . &quot;
&quot; at their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve strate@@ gi@@ sts spend two days this week around a 27 @-@ foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it &apos;s time to lift the body for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; a mur@@ al of the United States is im@@ pending at one end of the ren@@ ounced , two @-@ storey seat hall . &quot;
the card is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues shall put the economic interests of the nation in front of all other things .
the central bank has a two @-@ fold mandate from Congress : maxim@@ ising U.S. employment and prices stable here .
&quot; but since the great recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict them . it will be announced on Thursday whether the U.S. economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented stimulus through the near @-@ term interest rate at the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the data in the economy show that it grows solid , recent tur@@ mo@@ il in the global financial markets could frigh@@ ten the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives to reinforce this volati@@ lity by raising interest for federal securities - and be it just a quarter percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation are primarily the most important thing they see , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , head econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not raise interest rate , the increased uncertainty around the global market is enough justification to continue to wait , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which ass@@ ures the financial market itself . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predicted a raise of interest this week . &quot;
&quot; financial markets , however , expect to wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that indicates only a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this points to a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the sentence , unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts l@@ essen the impact by promising that another increase is far away . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage rose by 21.@@ 28.@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9.@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , said John Lon@@ sky , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at that point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , she would have to go very far in her explanation to calm the financial markets so that she would not panic . &quot;
other experts argued that interest increase would calm the financial markets because it would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed would take action .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed appeared on a good way to increase the set by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow tigh@@ tening of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ ellen had said in spring and early summer that in spite of the complaints of liber@@ als , she expected more economic progress , an increase of the sentence . &quot;
&quot; although the creation of jobs slow@@ ed in August , improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level which the F@@ ed considers as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effect of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can deal with higher interest rates and needs it because of the tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world coinci@@ ded with the end of last month after China had de@@ valued its currency .
&quot; the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage value fell by more than 16 % in May , when investors feared that the Chinese economy slow@@ ed down global growth . &quot;
&quot; the market has somewhat recovered this month , whereas the Dow is now almost 10 % below the peak of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when the interest should be increased . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news on the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the past few weeks , they would attract re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former member of the US National Bank . &quot;
now he says that she will wait at least a month to get the impact better in the grip .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liner . &quot;
&quot; the health of the world economy is none of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed monetary authority has become the world .
the influence of the central bank has been enormous over the past few years .
&quot; the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; its monetary expansion , spark@@ ed confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives can expect that they not only monitor developments elsewhere , but also seek advice with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management of En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ er , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noticed this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of re@@ actions on financial market movements that are apparently not linked to the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; Lack@@ ier , Member of the Federal Open Market Committee , committed to raising interest , made decisions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia enabled the F@@ ed to reduce its growth rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite the limited impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; one year later , the F@@ ed representatives revers@@ ed these cuts . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ ed should place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as market re@@ unification in 2008 , said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee on the Bank of England &apos;s interest on interest . &quot;
&quot; the recent tur@@ mo@@ il doesn &apos;t come close to that level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly does not want to get into the situation where she is afraid of interest in interest , because the markets are rising up , &quot; &quot; said P@@ osen , President of the Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention the financial stability , and until that is changed , I do not believe it should be ahead of time . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;
&quot; yes , it is in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central contact point and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewelry and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car section if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes over an hour to stroll through the corri@@ dors . &quot;
&quot; if the whole grocery you are hungry , there is a meal at the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and inexpensive ) in this store is close to the coff@@ ers and has different collection options .
what is there : do you need something - something - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are inexpensive and a number of them is sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruits and more . &quot;
&quot; the meat counter is extensive , as is the fish bar - the staff behind the bar will clean and filter fish and even fry on request for you . &quot;
&quot; a good part of the store is part of the massive freezer section . here you can find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ gan@@ t , whole du@@ cks , fish , bo@@ vine blood and g@@ all , pork , regional saus@@ age , commercially prepared food and more . &quot;

the wide corri@@ dors are suitable for trol@@ leys and for@@ klift trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the outskirts of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown - a few blocks away from Philippe The Original .
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area along with other shops and restaurants .
&quot; even if the shop is well @-@ frequ@@ ented , it is not difficult to find a parking space . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Assistance for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees are arriving in Germany for these days .
&quot; to prepare a warm welcome , is not without the commitment of countless volunteers . &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
Petra and Klaus H@@ eine belong to them .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach her 74 lessons .
&quot; every Thursday , she is doing it in the asylum seek@@ er &apos;s home at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße . &quot;
&quot; it helps refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn German . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite another lesson than at a proper school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s pa@@ edi@@ atric company Rio Grande encourages nutrition for healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to inform women about how important good nutrition is during breast@@ feeding . it does this with the presentation of images of babies who su@@ ck on breasts , which are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that a higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification necessary for mothers . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at the Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet of pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from the development of tumours . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bernstein &apos;s sports hall
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the € 2.3 million sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof can be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ longed @-@ long turn@@ table bau on the Bern@@ rie@@ der sports grounds are progres@@ sing step by step : in the latest joint session , the completed construction application was unanim@@ ously agreed without large discussions . &quot;
&quot; prior to this , the board had decided , among other things , an application for a legislative &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; from the valid construction plan . &quot;
&quot; with the &quot; exception , &quot; permission was given for a special form regarding the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ compatible first and roof over@@ hang &quot; &quot; should be erected . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; this gives us a wonderfully large south roof , &quot; explained mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; in the case of &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; , &quot; it was again about the tilt of the roof , which for energetic reasons - differently than in the construction plan - should be below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; this is why a &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was necessary because the development plan for the a@@ fores@@ aid has no &quot; &quot; exceptions &quot; &quot; - whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council generally relies more restric@@ tively on liber@@ ating orders . &quot;
&quot; this is not a recurring project : &quot; we do not create a preced@@ ent , &quot; says St@@ eigen@@ berger . &quot;
the gymn@@ asi@@ um building at the Sports Centre is a joint project between the municipality and the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the same time , some 2.3 million euros have been calculated . &quot;
subsidies are expected from school and l@@ atitude sports funding .
&quot; in the next stage of the proceedings , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre @-@ large hall will be submitted to the Land@@ rats@@ amt . &quot;
Klinik P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg is expected to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) will be the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; the surprising plans of the hospital &apos;s hospital , the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , confirmed this . &quot;
&quot; however , the Supervisory Board decided to make a decision on this , and the next Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg would be employed . &quot;
the vast majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing internal station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees who cannot go to Sch@@ ong@@ au should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , says J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
employees are informed about the plans .
&quot; Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has been a medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer Klinik since the beginning of the year , has now changed to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play , who agreed to take the lead from 1 October and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means &quot; upgrading &quot; and a distribution of the offer in the field of internal medicine , &quot; said J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) is specialized in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases on the inside .
&quot; for the next two years , fisher@@ man with his team is said to be with his team if the Supervisory Board appro@@ ves both of them , until next year the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ schaft , which has 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after almost 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the District Apostle had planned this for 2018 , when the currently ongoing renovation at the Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital was completed . &quot;
&quot; mayor J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met ru@@ mo@@ urs about what the house , which is owned by the federal government , should be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; I conclude that . &quot; as it goes on with the property , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß asser@@ ted not to say there are several considerations . &quot;
&quot; currently , there is a short @-@ term care for Car@@ itas and a day@@ esp@@ a @-@ psychiat@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come back , &quot; &quot; said Fischer about the quasi @-@ reloc@@ ation to the Le@@ ch , which was received by the staff &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , where Fischer has been working as chief physician for more than 30 years , did not give it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; the hospital P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure in recent decades , departments have been closed , for example surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand@@ balls of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar lions are called for the Berg@@ ischer HC tonight ( 8.@@ 15 p.m. ) .
&quot; although the leader of the Bundes@@ liga in Wuppertal is the clear favourite , there is no reason for arrogan@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; during the last season , the ba@@ thers at Bh@@ c occupied a painful defeat and made a good decision there . &quot;
hunting accident with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers have been seriously injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during super@@ sti@@ tion on a maize field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district of Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in use as the police reported . &quot;
&quot; after a shot , a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered severe injuries and were brought to hospitals . &quot;
&quot; how exactly it could come to the accident , was unclear at first . &quot;
the crimin@@ al@@ poli@@ z@@ ei is determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victim of violent crimes
&quot; a crime suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of the 16 @-@ year @-@ old , missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , missing since Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old admitted that the young people were killed and their corp@@ se was thrown into a channel in rock breaks . &quot;
&quot; a 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate , who has been missing for Saturday , has fallen victim to violent crimes . &quot;
&quot; the young woman &apos;s body was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , as public prosec@@ utor and police said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old is also considered to be active on the Tuesday evening , according to the statement , and the investigation led to the discovery site of the corp@@ se . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old had been missing on Sunday morning after she hadn &apos;t come home after a visit of an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen on the eve of a visit to Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in the search for the young woman , investig@@ ators first met the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in the case of surveys in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces , there was a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen , where the corp@@ se was found . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the authorities reported to the authorities that the 16 @-@ year @-@ old killed and laid the dead bodies in the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old should be presented to the fun@@ nel on Wednesday , the investig@@ ators put a stop to him . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the further investigations are supposed to bring about the close circumstances of action . &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing pressures
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for a paid lead .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
the social housing construction is facing a challenge .
the distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people are pushing for a market that is already over@@ loaded in many big cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the Association of &quot; &quot; Social housing construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for comparison , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany this year . &quot;
&quot; this means that 140@@ ,000 apartments are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many then come across the housing market and lined up in the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers in the last year lived for rent . &quot;
&quot; the negative development of the housing market , however , is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes considerable om@@ issions in the housing policy of recent years .
&quot; Germany is shooting a housing deficit , which grows from year to year . &quot;
&quot; currently there were around 77@@ ,000 residential units in the metrop@@ olitan areas , Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many working people therefore stayed in large cities in tw@@ inkl@@ ing of a flat in WG rooms .
&quot; young adults remained un@@ willingly in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; &quot; because of the l@@ utes on the housing market . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in the big cities , the number of square metres per cap@@ ita has declined again for the first time in recent years . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve this problem , the alliance &quot; Social housing construction &quot; proposes a re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should stimulate social housing . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the tax exemp@@ tion tax could be dispens@@ ed with and the basic tax for subsi@@ dis@@ ed flats is suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax amor@@ tization opportunities are necessary according to the alliance . &quot;
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters by the State Bank Kf@@ W is already well received by cities and municipalities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available 300 million euros have already been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with € 18@@ 4 million . &quot;
&quot; now , the project could even be increased . &quot;
refugees have free validity : Croatia and Slovenia judge Cor@@ ri@@ dor
&quot; there is practically no coming to Hungary anymore , as more and more refugees choose the way over Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces the passage through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous nonetheless .
Croatia wants to communicate with the neighbouring country of Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the Slov@@ ene interior minister , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; &quot; said the Croatian Minister of Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia lies between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the deportation of the Serbian Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to reach Western Europe . &quot;
&quot; 500 people have come across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the RT@@ L Croatian television station . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the eve of the day .
&quot; new laws , which entered into force the same day , practically render superf@@ lu@@ ous asylum procedures in Hungary superf@@ lu@@ ous . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic said : &quot; &quot; they can travel through and we prepare for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and want to achieve something . &quot;
&quot; however , there are people who did not want to live in Croatia . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police picked up the first refugees at the border of Serbia to the EU neighbouring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , most of the media reports from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id both by bus and with taxis .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk across the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not reach border f@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the border strip has other dangers : there are still sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s . &quot;
mine clear@@ ers are to rapidly create a safe passage .
&quot; however , after the closure of the border , hardly more refugees come to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the police counted 3@@ 66 attacked people . &quot;
shortly before closing on Monday it had been 9@@ 380 .
the new Hungarian laws set the overcoming and damage of the border zone as a criminal off@@ ence .
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed in the south @-@ Hungary border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted thre@@ aten sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted in the &quot; &quot; transit zones &quot; &quot; established at the border on Tuesday , almost all of them - 93 - at the most important crossing of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants are 13 families with small children , as well as two elderly people . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , there were still 40 refugees standing there . &quot;
&quot; practically , however , no one has a view to get asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; in Hungarian opinion , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers are to be deported there .
&quot; just a few hundred refugees gathered in front of the &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke workers started to clean up .
they collected garbage that tens of thousands of people left on the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
lock gri@@ l@@ les were disman@@ tled and one of the records in the bor@@ der@@ line was rebuilt .
nobody wanted to express the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closure of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; about 20,000 migrants were still in the country after government declarations . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , around 1400 people are waiting for the continuation of the journey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by German authorities . &quot;
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy with ti@@ dying after the bridge festival on Sunday when there were suddenly ten people with travel companions at the entrance of the tent , &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein &apos;s mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; tourists , they wanted by train to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; because Germany had surprisingly closed the rail traffic with Austria on Sunday , but due to the influ@@ x of refugees , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein , &quot; &quot; said Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the borders together with two other hel@@ pers and their cars across the border into the near Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; before that , we first su@@ cked the un@@ expect@@ edly guests , with a snack and a drink . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring them by car to Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N interview . &quot;
they were very thank@@ ful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euros for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; that made us very happy , &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE into a regional train in the direction of Passa@@ u . after the short notice , the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still beyond the border . &quot;
&quot; the regional train , however , was placed before the border into W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing is generally high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the bridge @-@ fest connected with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ ably , on the day before a two brid@@ le sports - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bavaria from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
&quot; Viktor Or@@ b@@ án , now sending more tens of thousands to us , is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy : &quot;
&quot; instead of helping in the camp of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke immediately in the establishment of structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has publicly and publicly advanced the attitude of the Hungarian government to the world of National Socialism . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; the refugees will also have to find that the &quot; yellow land , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but another refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a great challenge , given the ongoing influ@@ x of refugees and the approaching winter , in order to establish decent conditions for fire @-@ seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be an even greater one - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 winter@@ proof quarters &quot;
&quot; with the provision of refugees , Konrad has fully dealt with . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to set up neighbour@@ hoods for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen .
&quot; we have no more homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported on his first success . &quot;
&quot; the accommodation of the 20,000 refugees , who came to Austria on Monday , was without great confusion , said Konrad , and praised the organizational &quot; masterpiece . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of the Interior , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in total Konrad comp@@ utes with a demand of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the year of the year . &quot;
&quot; in order to meet the number , 35@@ ,000 accommodations will have to be found in the next few weeks - 20,000 are expected to provide the federal government . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but there is no bot@@ tom@@ less pit , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already held talks with the state cent@@ uri@@ ons .
&quot; they would have assured him to create quarters for the coming refugees , too . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria things are going well , &quot; Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er said . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ ator supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow it will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and will be clari@@ fied as to how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations into the ORF &quot; &quot; Hel@@ fen &quot; &quot; campaign as well . &quot;
&quot; on the platform , private persons can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; very high . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it could not be that squ@@ at@@ ters must observe a certain height of the towel holder or the size of the th@@ igh . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; emergency standards &quot; would have to apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of Interior , that he was more successful at accommodation , Konrad explains with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further into the face of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asion is his most important weapon .
&quot; Konrad and Mai@@ er do not inc@@ ur any costs for the Republic , as they declared themselves . &quot;
they want to increase their number of employees to three to four .
your own neighborhood search has not been successful so far .
Konrad wanted to place a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better distribution
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for the accommodation of refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the parties are currently under control without these measures , says mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of an emergency , however , other sites should be checked for their suitability . &quot;
criticism has been critici@@ zed by the head of the city on the distribution of refugees within the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; limits are not sealed &quot;
&quot; during a lengthy phone call with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , Gover@@ nor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) corro@@ bor@@ ated the further action in the refugee issue on Monday . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders are not sealed off .
the continuation of refugees in the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding border controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , special trains with refugees to Germany will no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; the guards , however , would be brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once called for greater solidarity in the issue of refugees . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , that now also Austria takes control of its borders , there is a logical consequence for P@@ ühr@@ inger &quot; from the German course of action . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general renovation of the &quot; Neue Wer@@ ft &quot; in the Lin@@ zer industrial line is officially closed .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group S &amp; T is dra@@ fted , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be le@@ ased to young , innovative companies from the Technology Division . &quot;
&quot; in IT the smart heads are our raw material - and we must try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T boss Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he can imagine investing in the start @-@ up companies of the New Wor@@ ker and later also to acquire them .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T in the site , 3.3 million euros from the Tech@@ Center , which belongs to one third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is watched by the Linz AG for 60 years on S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square meters of residual space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ hab@@ erin opened second store in the Arctic
the focus is on Fur@@ la hand@@ bags in the new shop .
&quot; actually , Jutta Br@@ eit wanted to get a dog . &quot;
&quot; this project had to post@@ p@@ one the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , it has now grown in the form of a further business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop opposite the shop in which it sells among other things bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from various manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets from 75 Euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; before , several weeks had been rebuilt . &quot;
&quot; but I thought for a long time , if I want to open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the decision was that the Fur@@ la producers who are at home in Bologna from the idea of their own location where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Greater Linz that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who even had Italian roots . &quot;
her fashion interest has been brought to the cra@@ dle by her mother .
&quot; most of all , if something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices . &quot;
&quot; why some woman , when looking at a hand@@ bag in a tran@@ ce , can &apos;t answer the question with the latest security . &quot;
maybe it &apos;s because a nice bag is upgraded every outfit .
the Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the P@@ fäl@@ zer ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place whose inhabitants are called An@@ ders .
this property also unites some with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; whether it mani@@ f@@ ests itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , re@@ porters or reveals knowledge gaps in international crisis politics - the candidate for the US presidential office power@@ fully boo@@ sts the election campaign . &quot;
and cuts off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire come from . &quot;
the New Yorker with the conci@@ li@@ ation@@ ist is a term to many in Win@@ zer@@ dorf on the wine road .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabit@@ ant @-@ place is related to it via -@@ ump@@ y corners .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pfalz : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in election campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do villa@@ gers think of being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find that exciting somehow , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stad@@ ter way , &quot; &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter has filmed an entertaining documentary about the town and its famous children , among whom besides Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz is counted . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , also speaks in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he did not bring it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also the opinion that Tru@@ mp is already a bit of a big mau@@ l , &quot; Wen@@ del says . &quot;
&quot; random loud the nick@@ name that K@@ all@@ stadt has in the circle , &quot; &quot; The Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - to High German : the An@@ ders , she says . &quot;
&quot; thus , Tru@@ mp is coming from the village of the An@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 , when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the United States . &quot;
the corner@@ stone of the real estate group was the first real estate sales in New York .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homeland in the long term , failed at the Bavarian State , to which the Pal@@ at@@ inate was at that time . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp , because he was once without permission , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , declared the start of the film . &quot;
Tru@@ mp was the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes striking statements of the descendants .
he had spoken repeatedly about Mexican immigrants in the USA and demanded the construction of a border wall to deter illegal immigrants .
&quot; as the pol@@ y , it is not so symp@@ athetic , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant relative Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The O@@ ma was a born tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the wine gro@@ wer is more likely to dis@@ soci@@ ate the American , &quot; he is always so upset . &quot;
does he think that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he never cared about K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the pension econom@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm men@@ tions like some c@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the family Heinz donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally well anchored . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that from Donald , &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; they find it better if he doesn &apos;t make the choice , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that is good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the United States would have been like him , &quot; would he never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting themes than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ ra@@ chter Sarah Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
and : &quot; the grapes are ripe without the president Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els Film , for whom Tru@@ mp has been inter@@ viewed for a long time , have seen 12@@ ,000 cinem@@ ago@@ ers , also in the USA are awak@@ ened the interest . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian village Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first &quot; mountain climbing village . &quot;
&quot; from the hand of the vice @-@ president of the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 inhabitants village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den National Park received the award for soft tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the local Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
a &quot; mountain climbing village &quot; may have a maximum of 2500 inhabitants .
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
&quot; seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews , despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at Today Show &quot;
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son ha@@ sten to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report the loss of the leadership of the liber@@ als , but there are no major shifts in today &apos;s reviews . &quot;
the breakfast show of N@@ ine was broad@@ cast@@ ed by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull caused the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was included in London as part of a week @-@ long series of international TV shows , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this draw@@ back to the resistance seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators among the five capitals compared to today &apos;s 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , Today , a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; today , Today , Today , the gap to Sun@@ rise has closed . &quot;
&quot; in August , Today reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 in comparison to the 33@@ 0.000 of Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance was between 40,000 and 50,000 . &quot;
&quot; until now , Sun@@ rise stands at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators at 3@@ 14@@ ,000 in Today . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing happening every morning .
the winds of change involve these morning min@@ ers more than Parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former serial number of Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ter Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently weather@@ ed father , who decides to settle down with his two children on New Zealand &apos;s coast , reached a very impressive figure of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics were wondering if Thom@@ son could play a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ter Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
the result of yesterday evening responded with a clear &quot; yes . &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and hit the block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL family ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 to 17 : 30 ) of the new qui@@ z show , moder@@ ated by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored an average 44@@ 6.000 visitors . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a small victory over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening , the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia reached 5@@ 20,000 spectators and in the second half hour there was a total of 7@@ 20,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the drop in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that hot @-@ sea will eventually prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollars that failed to over@@ take the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires show .

the last three agree : Bachelor &apos;s Sam Wood is the perfect man - but whom will he choose ?
mystery unveiled ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have un@@ wit@@ t@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
the woman who finally landed at Sam Wood in The Bachelor was covered in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y .
none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether she is the one who has received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows on the day before out of three two , you may have acci@@ dentally given an indication of who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women were ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and thereby called his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? , &quot; could be their answers to the game corrupted who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
everyone named Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki both quickly - except himself - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship from the first day .
&quot; from the moment I entered the house and re@@ marked ( Sarah ) and S@@ ams energies , I sen@@ sed that they were pretty compatible and I thought it throughout the show , &quot; said Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; &quot; added Mark@@ os@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; I have seen them together , and they have the right chemistry . &quot;
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes she and Sam Wood are well suited as pairs .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house made it clear last week that Wood is &quot; the One . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and the family , I realized that this is obviously not just a game - I &apos;m now un@@ condition@@ ally tuned to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say it , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor will be broadcast on ten on Wednesday , 7 : 30 pm . &quot;

Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest in its reloc@@ ation to the USA - and there were many other teams looking for en@@ quiries after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose San Francisco 49@@ ers and trainer Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ or as it did the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ ver@@ ts at his first pun@@ t return on Tuesday at 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a confi@@ ded to his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity for a pun@@ t return and also in the current game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies against the rest of the team , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a confirmed Hay@@ ne publicly in his press conference after the match .
&quot; the 49@@ ers Spor@@ tre@@ porter Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his scrat@@ ched catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
&quot; it was certainly not the start , the Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian followers had hoped for his N@@ FL spin . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 , that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career , &quot;
&quot; that was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
&quot; Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his Orig@@ in debut in 2007 , when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land . &quot;
&quot; overall , it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;

the Free voters demand the setting of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria because of the high number of refugees .
&quot; head of party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned at the beginning of the F@@ W in Groß@@ stadt before a severe crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there are not enough new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to keep the schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will receive awards in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Land@@ tag faction of the Free voters conven@@ ed until Friday in the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
&quot; actually , all other main topics were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free voters &apos; meeting .
&quot; of course , the issue will over@@ lay the exam , &quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , as existed during the Yugoslavia @-@ wars in the n@@ ine@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; this is not the case , we must address the causes , &quot; &quot; said the Free voters . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to post@@ p@@ one the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for administrative courts who are responsible for asylum claims : &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ W boss critici@@ zed that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; &quot; we would need uniform standards of federal states nationwide . &quot;
&quot; Bayern p@@ ushes , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more powerful . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but the state policy in big wall@@ stadt should not fall under the table .
a long @-@ standing torch remains on the agenda : the educational policy .
&quot; for the new school year , Minister of Culture Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; &quot; Mittel@@ stufe plus &quot; , &quot; in which an extension of the high school secondary school was tested from three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger is not far enough .
&quot; the topic G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W boss . &quot;
we call for freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums who want to do so .
&quot; free travel at G@@ 9 , wherever it is desired . &quot;
festive Wall Street helps D@@ ax on jumps
&quot; following an over @-@ wide routes , the German stock market closed with winn@@ ings within a wide @-@ ranging and nervous trade . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon was a clear pr@@ elu@@ de to the US stock exchanges for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10 18@@ 8,@@ 13 points upwards . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X average value gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 55@@ 2.@@ 88 points .

&quot; Euro Sto@@ xx 50 as the Euro zone &apos;s lead index declined by 1,@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid profits also booked commercial venues in London and Paris .
&quot; in the United States , the Dow Jones Index posted around 1 percent in the plus . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; many Bör@@ si@@ ans expect the markets to be replaced until after the interest in the US and for the large decline in the fut@@ ures on this Friday . &quot;
the discussion about the burdens arising from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the shares of RW@@ E to a record low and also left deep traces on E@@ on .
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies may be missing 30 billion euros in provisions . &quot;
the Federal Government denied the numbers mentioned in the press .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered something , but ultimately always lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
&quot; at the D@@ ax peak , Infin@@ eon shares increased by another 3.@@ 22 percent . &quot;
&quot; according to a tra@@ der , a positive report from the US investor magazine &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; according to this , investors gave little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot;
the investments in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the car market should be paid out .
&quot; car values were in demand : even in August , even in the traditionally weak summer month of August more cars were sold than in the year @-@ earlier period , as the industry association AC@@ EA took part in the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the official documents of Daimler and BMW coaches increased by 1,@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively . &quot;
Volkswagen assets increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
&quot; in the German pension market , the return on stock exchange listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent . &quot;
&quot; the pension index Re@@ x rose by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9,@@ 55 points . &quot;
&quot; the Con@@ federation @-@ Future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4,@@ 11 points . &quot;

&quot; by mid@@ day , the European Central Bank had set the reference course to $ 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) . &quot;
the dollar therefore cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) .

&quot; the violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ an expan@@ se district , some 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , leader district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire@@ bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot into the air before resor@@ ting to rubber bul@@ lets .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the used rubber bul@@ lets , known to be able to kill , but are traditionally used as a less le@@ thal alternative , evi@@ dently produced such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last week of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ ae@@ ans say that new provinces being formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution would l@@ essen their political influence . &quot;
there were also protests in the Western Nepal by the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that want their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been in violent confron@@ tations since the 10th . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which has been centrally ruled for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the law@@ makers ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; this week the leg@@ is@@ lators voted on certain cl@@ auses in the draft constitution in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction area planned in the city
the property at the Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square metre area .
&quot; a mixture of trade , commerce and living is planned - but there are no concrete offers . &quot;
Em@@ den - The town of Em@@ den wants to market an area of approximately 4000 square meters in direct vicinity to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
the preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mixture of trade , commerce and living . &quot;
&quot; if you wait for appropriate offers , it is called the city . &quot;
which investor would come into question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts were concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city Em@@ den had bought a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner Great street already a few months ago and the building on it can be torn off . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday settlement on the Small Sea at Em@@ den take shape .
the investor was making public plans for the project for the first time .
many An@@ li@@ eger are further al@@ armed - they fear the sale of their leisure time
&quot; for months , behind closed doors was negotiated , gr@@ ati@@ fied , deb@@ ated and drawn . &quot;
now the plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea are close to Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ est , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System Building , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the Em@@ den Council &apos;s urban development committee . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the order of the day . &quot;
&quot; under pressure from the project critics and the F@@ DP parliamentary group , which accused the investor and the administration of sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end went on the offensive from the system @-@ construction management : &quot; &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; &quot; he said before the Council members and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
the ten to twelve million Euro projects have been under discussion for months .
&quot; violent reactions among sea@@ worthy owners , who had come to the meeting , caused the pictures and new details on the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , sea owner and board member at the advoc@@ acy of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; this is a giant cla@@ p that overlooks all other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like several other project critics , that traffic would increase by the intended scope of the system : &quot; there must be entire bus inv@@ itations to pay for it , &quot; says Schulz &quot;
&quot; what exactly is happening on the well @-@ a @-@ hect@@ are area of the former restaurant , is still open . &quot;
there is still no operator .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ end . &quot;
&quot; because this was still lacking , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

the Frankfurt Zoo is looking forward to offspring at its gor@@ illas .
the 26 @-@ year @-@ old Di@@ an has brought tw@@ ins to the world yesterday .
twin @-@ bir@@ ths are rare with gor@@ illas .
the last one in a German zoo is nearly 50 years back and was also in Frankfurt in 1967 .
&quot; the sex of the new@@ born gor@@ illa @-@ tw@@ ins still does not stand firm , since mother Di@@ an has so far kept her close to the body . &quot;

Google launches double donation campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
Google Inc ( Goo@@ gl . O ) announced a dou@@ bling @-@ donation campaign to aid tens of millions of humanitarian organizations that will help thousands of refugees fle@@ eing the European nations as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries .
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach when announ@@ cing the donations appeal on its blog .
&quot; instead of making the announcement of a manager , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee , who had fled with her family from Kab@@ ul when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our journey included many dark train and bus journeys , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but since the refugee and migrant crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four charitable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global raised donations will be doubled up to a value of 5.5 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com / as@@ say to $ 11 million .
&quot; Europe is facing its worst refugee crisis since the Second World War , largely due to the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many flee from the war torn apart by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery can be helpful for slightly overweight diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for obes@@ e people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it is still too early to tell if easily obes@@ e people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial on the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss operations or obesity surgery , use various methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity sur@@ geri@@ es have proven effective in the treatment of type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been carried out in humans who are obes@@ e obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a certain amount of weight in terms of size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Tai@@ wan@@ ese Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c cancer - to medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
&quot; the average BM@@ I of those who underwent this surgery decreased from 31 to 24@@ ,5 to the end of the fifth year in this study . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I stayed with those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments roughly equal to 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % of the diabetes condition was completely eliminated and 28 % in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medi@@ cally @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved in only one percent and in some cases only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol were generally better in the &quot; surgical &quot; group , &quot; the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored the blood glucose level of hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c , which reflects the blood glucose levels over time . &quot;
&quot; hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept below 7 percent , the researchers write . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , the leading researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared average results with the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group lost more weight compared to the hom@@ ec@@ tomy group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reaching higher returns in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs. 5.1 % ) and hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and recorded a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are indications from a study of heavier people in Sweden that surgery leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was in obes@@ e people who underwent O@@ bes@@ ity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried more conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no advantage for survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for people with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
&quot; Black@@ stone added that people and their physicians should start taking weight seriously , as soon as the patient lies with his BM@@ I between 27 and 30 . &quot;
&quot; I think we wait too long , until we bring people to take this seriously , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think that once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have soli@@ di@@ fied their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really hard . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a subject that is increasingly attracting attention in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular at school times and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly , meets the flock of her youth after years , and she falls in love with her . &quot;
so also in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der .
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel should be interesting especially for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the full @-@ time author grew up in Lang@@ weiler and is pleased that she could put a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; &quot; &quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe &quot; &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News &quot;
&quot; Europe cannot accommodate all refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution of the refugee crisis in the Middle East is lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
&quot; the Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the United Kingdom in his speech on the occasion of the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford , which focuses on ethics studies . &quot;
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible for everyone to come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama praised Germany and Austria &apos;s efforts to cope with the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime you need to think about long @-@ term solutions such as real peace and real development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing is reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of violence .
&quot; the use of violence has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama also addressed the issue of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s actions after the terrorist attack of 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US drew a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my con@@ dol@@ ences in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem is non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he put on force , and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of in@@ gest@@ ant dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant by children over the last 4 years
&quot; poison control centers in the United States report an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under 12 years of age , which swal@@ lows strong alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , says the Georgia Po@@ ison Centre . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Centre , the cases of revenue of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under 12 years of age , reported to poison control centres reported from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16.@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are getting more and more common to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them enter the emergency room , &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said some children visi@@ bly drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation in the social media .
videos on YouTube show how young dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants drink only for a cheap experience .
young people allegedly have mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with alcohol @-@ containing mou@@ th@@ wash in order to obtain a harder drink .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; Lop@@ ez said . &quot;
many of the more attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those who are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there are dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with straw@@ berry , grape and orange scent that are very appealing to children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
only a few sp@@ lashes can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation especially with small children .
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison report centre at the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the station Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let slip whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant in reach of children , and if children are coming to it then it is a quick way to consume a lot of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl who recently took four sp@@ lashes of straw@@ berry fragran@@ ces in the school , was brought into an emergency room for treatment . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold , which is legally regarded as dr@@ unken in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , a medical emergency doctor who treated her in the G@@ ear@@ ett Medical Center outside of Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah told her words and was not able to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors monitored her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of cereb@@ ral trauma , as the girl had fallen through alcohol and had met her head , Rit@@ ch@@ ey said . &quot;
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ tori@@ a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use non @-@ alcoholic products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store wall dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the child &apos;s reach .
&quot; beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants that contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities employees suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution rather than eth@@ yl alcohol , which was recorded as an active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth grade in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti@@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; said a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ished her out of her room .
&quot; the police regarded the ei@@ ving plan as &quot; &quot; squ@@ ir@@ rel &quot; &quot; and referred to disciplinary measures to the school authority . &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged
&quot; during a rear @-@ end collision between Nor@@ dr@@ ing and Her@@ mes , a 33 @-@ year @-@ old car driver was slightly injured in a rear @-@ end collision . &quot;
a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove to the roundabout in the direction of roundabout industrial area and realised too late that two vehicles that were ahead of the roundabout had stopped at the roundabout .
&quot; as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this vehicle to a nearby Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; there was a damage of about 10,000 euros in the vehicles involved in the accident , dividing the police . &quot;
the Audi of the 33 @-@ year @-@ old was no longer ready and had to be tow@@ ed .

Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was immediately rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . this insi@@ sted that he and his team mates are not under increased control as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch ranking leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football dri@@ es Dut@@ ch@@ man - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers @-@ mid@@ fiel@@ der and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans have lost interest in Celtic , there is no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; de Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no highlights of the Celtic Games and why ? &quot;
it &apos;s because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk about the return of the R@@ angers .
they talk about Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that &apos;s what they are interested in .
&quot; there is a lot of tension in the Old @-@ Firm Games , and there are not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic must fight , but the Norwegian boss sw@@ ells to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; after the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the following withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat was followed by 10 @-@ man from Aber@@ deen , who are now clearly at the top of the table with five points . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said : &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what &apos;s happening . &quot;
we feel that exactly this way - but we have to go on .
&quot; we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously with January transfers

&quot; the ex @-@ boss of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; &quot; the January @-@ Transfer Window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
&quot; the players who come in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate themselves , which you have seen with our own group this season . &quot;
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage will be done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said , &quot; There is no team that has won everything , in cups or le@@ agues , who won &apos;t win games this way . &quot;
unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged while in the United Kingdom it grows overall .
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged from May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above that of the U@@ K@@ s of 5.5 percent , as the figures of the Bureau for National Statistics ( ON@@ S ) showed . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12.@@ 000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure exceeding the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has made the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;
dr@@ unken irrit@@ ated the course
&quot; since the security personnel could not paci@@ fy the situation , the staff called the police . &quot;
only with the use of pepper spray could the officials take the stur@@ geon in custody .

a 28 @-@ year @-@ old had 2.@@ 15 Pro@@ mil@@ le and remained in the custody .
why I am witn@@ essing an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; when it happens , and I hope it will not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary , when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation was made for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked I agreed . &quot;
&quot; as the day drew closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
I agreed because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty .
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see exec@@ utions in the United States , and since more applications are available as seats , a more mac@@ ab@@ re lot@@ tery will take place in order to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media places from 12 to five .
&quot; who is selected , will observe it emotion@@ less . &quot;
I can &apos;t do that .
&quot; I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps closest friend , with whom I developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hours visit . &quot;
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I won &apos;t be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remember all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you &apos;ll get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that &quot; &quot; it could have been better phr@@ ased , &quot; &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong , what I do . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and wrote .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; if he dies , he thinks that the public relations work will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ y@@ ware , a re@@ porter of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I have made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go down here again .
I cannot say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the assass@@ ination of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of action .
but I believe that there is a strong likel@@ ihood that it is not guilty of murder .
I believe that there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe his execution is wrong .
and from this perspective I will see him dying .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters that you can turn to .
what you get from me is what it means to see a man dying an unnecessary death .
&quot; man after a damp police ch@@ ase , persu@@ aded to come out of the Cann@@ ing River &quot;
the Cann@@ ing V@@ ale polic@@ eman remained dry when he over@@ talked the man of the Cann@@ ing River .
&quot; a attempt by a man of Per@@ th to drop the police was un@@ successful when he was in shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , only a few meters away from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
the police of Cann@@ ing V@@ ale was called on Tuesday to a house peaceful break in Beck@@ en@@ ham .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape from them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in the water and said &apos; I &apos;m not coming out , come and get me &apos; , &quot; &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he addressed a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman negoti@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said Senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
master football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins provides an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , cous@@ ins set his car in the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim across the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ in @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy states that ste@@ wards from Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to end the race immediately .
&quot; he aimed at ste@@ wards and Racing Victoria &apos;s integrity department , claiming that they had a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media , that he has always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions when it came to the positive cob@@ alt @-@ dress rehear@@ sal at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he had held back 18 months for the es@@ pi@@ onage alle@@ gations and didn &apos;t want it to &quot; look like too high hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it , and I have sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are frustr@@ ated that everything comes out once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it went on .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I want to walk about the raised head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking I don &apos;t do it , then I should not be a coach anymore . &quot;
I have to think about what I do with my license .
previously M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb go up in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity section had tried to spy on his stable .
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago , Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart were sitting in a room with a man - whom I will name when asked - and offered him an occupation in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I &apos;m doing within my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy to Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they obviously believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if this is the case , they should surely touch their n@@ oses because they failed in trying to capture me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former Chairman of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , President of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at the time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the conclusion that it is personal ?
does the R@@ V@@ L behave in a cow@@ ard@@ ly way and perhaps makes people outside of coaches responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe the people out there that I am .
&quot; maybe they have to accept my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say is about it now . &quot;
&quot; but I have arrived at the point where I don &apos;t care , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and push them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the training levels of the trainer have been built up with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt inquiry in Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching said he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known by his preparation for the slaugh@@ tered master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race @-@ day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse &apos;s debate , which was against the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; one of my colleagues mistakenly applied mud on the leg . &quot;
it could have been like last night .
&quot; it could have been the whole day yesterday , which was so . &quot;
but it was also like that on the day of the race .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the package on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules know nothing about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here you have gone too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man arrested after driver cur@@ ses
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and followed driver cur@@ ses in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
the cycl@@ ist was delivered with a helicopter to the Royal Melbourne Hospital with serious injuries after he was hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway .
the police said the driver continued driving without stopping to help the injured rider .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 @-@ year @-@ old man from N@@ ath@@ alia joined the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
it is expected to be indic@@ ted for flight cur@@ ses and under @-@ dismissed aid and other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year old man from Cob@@ ram , stays in hospital . he is in a stable state . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy defe@@ ats ri@@ vals because of claims for ring fights
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy has critic@@ ised the Tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; Agenda @-@ Set@@ ting &quot; by two Premier League favor@@ ites of N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ sters Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees allowed the Storm players &quot; &quot; ring fights &quot; &quot; with his team during the high storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne B@@ enn@@ ett made a barely concealed comment on the Storm team after winning the Final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; sample example &quot; of the Ru@@ g@@ by League and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in rings .
Bell@@ amy defended his team &apos;s t@@ ack@@ ery and said that they were only focused on their &quot; contact &quot; at tac@@ kling .
Bell@@ amy added that the cri@@ tique of two leading trainers in his team was confident that they were worried they were worried about being hit by the Storm team .
&quot; this time and again , I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson spoke about ring fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; Bell@@ amy said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; I can guarantee that we have changed nothing in our defensive system or techniques throughout the year . but over the past six weeks , we have made our contact with tac@@ kles a real focus , and this has provided us the turn@@ around for us . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . &quot;
it is funny how this occurs again and again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ ett &apos;s idea of &quot; thrilling soccer &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting soccer .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday evening with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said he would take care of a divorce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and that we watch as exciting , especially his young players at their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you would like to play if you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants everyone to play his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like them . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it came to big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm against R@@ oo@@ sters reached a higher result than the playing Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the playing of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more trials in our game , but is that an exciting game ? &quot;
or are breaks making and no points something exciting ?
&quot; for me , it is the game boards . &quot;
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we will meet them in one phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team released this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday night in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; serving with 200,000 $ deposit after drug delivery &quot;
&quot; a man who may be threatened with a lifel@@ ong punishment because of his attempt to enter the possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine , smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land , was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men detained last month after the federal police found 100 kg of drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and in August in Co@@ om@@ era . &quot;
Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he met his co @-@ defend@@ ants at the marina in the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house where the police found 40 kil@@ os of the drug in a Toyota Echo .
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for trying to possess a commercial volume of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer argued about Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c that there was no proof that he tried to possess the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless cause . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the escape danger at Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the Court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had a deposit of 200,000 dollars as security jointly offered to achieve his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it statements of the two persons it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security deposit , under conditions that he gives off his Australian and his Serbian passport , reports to the police every day and keeps himself at an initial lock from 18 : 00 @-@ 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : driver &apos;s cab is torn apart
&quot; during a rear @-@ end collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three lor@@ ries involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late , trying in vain to do@@ dge at the last moment to the left , as the police said . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab torn apart completely .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours by 2 o &apos;clock .
&quot; there was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es to send images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 year old girl to demand pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg recorded the girl &apos;s phone when she was asleep and logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of in@@ decent pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl later woke up and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping couch .
&quot; she saw it through , found the conf@@ using messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother . &quot;
&quot; the police took care of it and saw the five pictures , then analyzed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; concerning &quot; &quot; web research , which used terms for searching for in@@ decent images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it , because it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the internet , &quot; and he then pre@@ tended to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor , E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on , said to the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; he said it would be addic@@ tive to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that searching on the computer was done by him , but said it happened because he wanted to claim to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es . &quot;
he was asked for his talks with the unknown person who sent him the pictures and which he asked to send more photos .
he said he did to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
&quot; MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone , she called her mother and was trem@@ bling and crying . &quot;
she also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the defend@@ ants with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded guilty to the indictment alleged to have included in@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year and not to appear before the court for a hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defense attorney Gregor S@@ im asked that Ho@@ gg does not appear in the Register of Sex@@ ual Cri@@ min@@ als , as one could argue that &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; can be found in his crime . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael postpon@@ ed judgement until October to receive background reports on social work .
&quot; in this case , Ho@@ gg was granted a security deposit , but was kept in custody for hear@@ ings to other pending cases . &quot;
he was taken up before the date of judgment into the list of sexual offen@@ ders .
smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers switch to small border cross@@ ings to Germany
more and more refugees are taken up away from the main control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many floo@@ d@@ houses caused people to increase in smaller border cross@@ ings due to fear of discovery and arrest
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the river Inn river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn since Tuesday . &quot;
they were on foot through bridges and up@@ keep to the German side .
&quot; there , they are received by the Federal Police and forwarded to the registration . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , a number of refugees arrived at Munich central station in comparison to the start of the week . &quot;
&quot; at 8@@ am alone , some 700 people had arrived in the state capital , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re @-@ establishment of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , the city reached 17@@ 59 refugees on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the southwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storms in the southwest from Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area across Western Europe , hot sea air currently flows into the country , distributed by the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the vigor@@ ous low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; &quot; Henry &quot; , &quot; which has been dra@@ gged from the Bermuda Islands over the Atlantic in the past few days . &quot;
violent storms and thunder@@ storms are expected mainly in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , even in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the Lake Constance District , DW@@ D can be expected from 60 to 90 kilometers per hour . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the sun can be seen longer . &quot;
the mass makes it : every two years the car manufacturers show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , it is mainly moving to the compact cars that are currently selling very well . &quot;
&quot; at present , cars from the compact class are particularly popular : around 28.@@ 1 percent of new registr@@ ations accounted for this segment in August alone , according to the Kraft@@ fahrt ( KBA ) division . &quot;
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept cars and new luxury cars , many new compact models are introduced this year . &quot;
&quot; one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German car industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available at dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel presents an entry below the largest competitor VW Golf , which starts at 17 650 euros . &quot;
the current Astra will cost from € 16 9@@ 90 .
the Astra is equipped with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offers more diesel and gasoline engines ranging from 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for which three @-@ cylinder petrol engines can also be used for the first time . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra only exists as a five @-@ door Astra . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the station wagon , which is also visible at the IAA . &quot;
and what will be added to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault sends the fourth generation of its Astra competitor Mé@@ gan@@ e into the race .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e is exclusively seen as a five @-@ door model in a conventional and a stressed sporty GT version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade , he arrives at the beginning of next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
&quot; with the new model , the Nissan depos@@ itor wants to find its position in the rapidly growing segment . &quot;
&quot; with its curved lines , the compact infin@@ iti is fully integrated into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but there is also a diesel engine with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which celebrates its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 @-@ liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
&quot; according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications , the maximum torque is 170 Nm ( Nm ) . &quot;
sales launch of Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; Ds 4 : not brand new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which is visible at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; on the outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ sen@@ ger played hand in front of the front panel : the radiator gri@@ lle was newly subscri@@ bed and the modified head@@ lights were equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was mainly moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons reduced by a touch@@ screen and integrated Apple &apos;s Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the refurbished Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has granted an ex @-@ prisoner of the Judi@@ cial Institute of Justice , which was housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are fundamentally entitled to financial compensation if they are housed in small cells . &quot;
this decision was made by the Federal Constitutional Court in a decision issued on Wednesday .
&quot; according to the judges , those affected can even hope for money if they were locked up only a few days in the confined spaces ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
thus an ex @-@ in@@ mate with his constitutional complaint in Karlsruhe was successful : he was accommodated in a single cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not spati@@ ally separated .
&quot; after that , the man , who , according to his lawyer , was now on the free foot , had been moved to a larger cell . &quot;
&quot; on account of the un@@ question@@ able conditions of detention against the country of Berlin , he failed . &quot;
&quot; however , the judges took up the decision of the Kammer@@ gericht Berlin and rejected the case for the re @-@ trial . &quot;
they see the human dignity of the man injured .
chamber Court now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of the compensation for compensation were decisive , an equ@@ ation was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be to be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Chamber of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of the indem@@ ni@@ fication .
&quot; in the past , the constitu@@ tion@@ ists have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war . &quot;
&quot; so they only spoke in April to a prisoner of damages , because he was imprisoned naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision of 2011 , human un@@ worthy is also the multiple assignment of a cell without a separate toilet . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had agreed a decent housing in a parallel incident in a parallel incident in November 2009 . &quot;
the then pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged daily between 15 and 21 hours a day between 15 and 21 hours in a similar cell as in the Karls@@ ru@@ her case .
&quot; in recent weeks , the Berlin pris@@ ons have also been hit the head@@ lines due to lack of staff . &quot;
&quot; prisoners are therefore always included 23 hours , the aggres@@ si@@ veness increases , even to temples should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; according to the Justice Press Office , 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied for lack of offspring , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; &quot; we create that &quot; &quot; &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Chancellor is determined to accept her .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany this year according to forecasts by Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated determination in view of the unusual challenge : &quot; I say again and again : we can do this and we can do that . &quot;
&quot; what comes to Germany , gives the following overview . &quot;
&quot; according to various progn@@ oses between 350@@ 000 ( estim@@ ation of the Federal Ministry of Education ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estim@@ ation of the P@@ est@@ el @-@ Institut ) apartments each year - and for the next five years . &quot;
this is almost twice as much as is currently being built ( 250@@ 000 apartments ) .
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all in paid rental objects : every year 60,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing units drop out of the rent for rent , and in order to apply these particularly favorable apartments , refugees will also apply . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s point of view is much too little : 80@@ ,000 social housing units would have to be built annually and the federal government would have to invest an increase of 6.@@ 4 billion per year . &quot;
&quot; however , researchers and Federal Minister of Education agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investment in residential construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the poultry in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
Claudia Walter is a project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation .
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial that they find work in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the admission society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of the immigrants , says Mig@@ rant @-@ researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ än@@ hardt , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of work for refugees to recognise labour . &quot;
&quot; while there was earlier a ban on employment for asylum seekers of up to five years , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the residence obligation to limit asylum seekers to a place of residence . &quot;
&quot; in society , even because of the shortage of skilled labour , the perspective has prevailed , that refugees should be able to access the labour market more quickly . &quot;
lack of German knowledge is a major hur@@ dle to access the labour market .
&quot; so far , there is still no adequate offer of general and occupational language courses . &quot;
research also shows that jobs are most often communicated by personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , the building of networks is the Königs@@ weg for work integration , according to Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin school administration has established that only a few fled parents give their children to the Kit@@ as , an estimated ten to 15 percent : &quot; &quot; for the un@@ rooted parents it is only important to keep the family together , &quot; &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ sty@@ bar , spokesperson for youth and family in the Berlin Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes hand@@ outs in different languages . &quot;
&quot; if the demand for educ@@ ators increased considerably by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase the capacity of education - for instance by allowing more specialized schools . &quot;
&quot; in the countries , students without knowledge of German will be prepared for instruction . &quot;
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , as in Berlin , also by teachers , who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ ade from Berlin &apos;s school administration . &quot;
the German Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 per cent of the refugees want to study in Germany .
&quot; in principle , no federal state of asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , In@@ ner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its stance . &quot;
studio @-@ willing refugees could be reli@@ eved of admission to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a res@@ titu@@ tion or tolerance do not receive any benefits after the asylum application law , if they begin a study . &quot;
&quot; the latter generally do not get b@@ af@@ o@@ g , as they do not fall under the circle of eligible persons . &quot;
&quot; tolerated refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years so far to be eligible for B@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 onwards , this period is reduced to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this gap must also be closed , Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s State Secretary for Science , and the German Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
students should immediately get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in the future , as many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually entr@@ ust the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and develop the existing state @-@ church law to a new state @-@ religions relationship . &quot;
&quot; it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organization , which takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally . &quot;
the rights also include duties .
&quot; thus , the representatives of Islam must agree on clear contact persons and be prepared to cooperate with the state in many areas and grant him certain control possibilities . &quot;
&quot; to this end , there is also a willingness to dog@@ gedly pursue religious fundament@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Central Council of the Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed concern on Thursday that religious conflicts could also be brought into Germany . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to au@@ gment such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law in Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be much more still a topic of the whole society . &quot;
&quot; in this way , even the majority society will have to change , the reduction of discrimination and racism is more pressing . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - has been an anti @-@ discrimination agency and a general equality law since a decade .
&quot; but it learns very slowly , as the NS@@ U @-@ murder @-@ series showed , in the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and interest groups of non @-@ white German have long been calling for and for which international agreements such as the anti @-@ racism conflict in Germany are committed , must become reality in the next few years if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use its opportunities for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is able to medi@@ cally supply the refugees previously expected , says Dr. Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; in terms of power and capacity , we create that , &quot; &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money must flow into the system for this purpose . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery invites all newcom@@ ers to impose health cards at the same time . &quot;
services rendered could later be bil@@ led with the federal states .
&quot; in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to break down so many people with the limited power catalogue , which the asylum application law considers . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors mostly do the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has demonstrated that migrants are more exposed to their illnesses than other patients . &quot;
&quot; interpreting costs would have to be taken over not only in hospitals , but also in medical practices . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also be helped with more general medical points of contact in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; in the case of refugee children , for example , there are significantly more disabled people , and for the young people it is about HIV @-@ clari@@ fication . &quot;
&quot; with the partially other diseases of the disease , German doctors were coming from their education but clearly , says Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; paras@@ ite attacks or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to detect . &quot; &quot; and as for the shortage of doctors , the refugees may even see relief in sight . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , some refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to practice , however , they must prove their qualifications and perhaps pass tests again . &quot;
&quot; at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill , according to estimates of the Bundes@@ Psych@@ otherap@@ e@@ ut@@ enk@@ ammer ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression . &quot;
&quot; especially vulnerable to refugee children , Dietrich Mun@@ z explains , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by the Technical University of Munich proves that every fifth Syrian refugee child arrives traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among others , suffer from so @-@ called flas@@ h@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms include sleep and concentration difficulties , strong deter@@ rence and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms from being chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; until now , only four percent of the mentally ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although mentally ill seekers can apply for psych@@ otherapy in the social offices , the treatment usually lasts for several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices there would be mostly cler@@ ks or doctors who are not trained for mental illness , decide if therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus art . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract each age group into the spell of fascinating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal dres@@ sage and unique entertainment . &quot;
&quot; now , the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the arena on the brick @-@ v@@ ases to dream . &quot;
&quot; our passion is circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , teacher and junior chef . &quot;
&quot; passion &quot; - under this motto is the current stage production .
&quot; for more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the family Pro@@ bst . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the gift for lovers is in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is important for us to get rid of people away from their everyday life and take them in a completely different world for two hours , &quot; stresses the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gen@@ cocktail with world city flair , &quot; says Director Reinhard Pro@@ bst , his concept . &quot;
&quot; 50 cities on the nearly 3,000 kilometre long tour can now experience this flair . &quot;
the circus programme impres@@ ses with talented artists from around the world .
&quot; awarded at the international circus festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family draws the audience with wit and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent films , it wants to easily assimil@@ ate the Cuban Duo . &quot;
ease and ag@@ ility - with these words they identify themselves .
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is supposed to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; apart from numerous salmon sal@@ ves , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ate with dex@@ ter@@ ity and articul@@ ation . &quot;
balancing with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He Yu@@ an .
snake people fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics and is fascinated by its mobility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos; mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
gri@@ ev@@ ances in the attitude of circus animals are only too often subject to various animal welfare organizations .
&quot; Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a position : &quot; &quot; isn &apos;t it good for our animals , it &apos;s not good either . &quot;
about 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each string unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; , &quot; as they are called lovingly , is retri@@ eved from the eyes whenever possible . &quot;
we want to work with the animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the beast doesn &apos;t feel comfortable , it doesn &apos;t want to go into the arena . &quot;
the upper@@ most order is : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid Jum@@ bo , a mixture of a sh@@ et@@ land pon@@ y stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud . &quot;
the two animals have lived in a habitat for eight years and nothing has happened .
&quot; but then suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo was there , &quot; &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst comments . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is not ready for the Man@@ ege , but it is the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; whether it &apos;s five or more 200 people , we always do our best and with all our heart . &quot;
circus Pro@@ bst starting from 17 to 20 September every day at 5 pm and 8 pm .
&quot; on Sunday , the program starts at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m. &quot;
&quot; Thursday is family day , for the performance at 5 p.m. the prices are reduced . &quot;
&quot; in addition , daily the ticket office is open from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. &quot;
Zim@@ bab@@ we@@ es Robert Mu@@ gabe holds a false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s oldest guide , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the case spread quickly across the social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ gations of opposition members of the opposition that they had received anonymous death threats and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
&quot; last month , they had broken him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the spokes@@ man for democratic change movement ( Movement for Democratic Change - M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their mobile phones , which warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not displayed , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns the members of Parliament that the immunity will end in Parliament , and once they leave Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party managed by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i is &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard will build up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the framework of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
HP will split into two listed companies later this year and separate the computer and printer business from its fast @-@ growing company hardware and service business activities .
&quot; the expected loss of jobs leads to a burden of more than 2.7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , said HP in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP @-@ Chairman and Chief Executive , who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a wide and diversified portfolio of businesses that support companies in transition to a new style of business , &quot; said Whit@@ man . &quot;
as an independent company we are better positioned than ever before to satisfy the changing needs of our customers around the world .
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual revenue and &quot; is focused on providing unprecedented , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; a statement by the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by the graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Packard to produce electrical systems and whose Pal@@ o Alto Garage is called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone massive restructuring in order to cope with the departure from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field , based on the conviction that closely focused firms provide better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team@@ mates before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb have to stand behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation runs according to plan there is no reason why he cannot play again before Christmas .
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in the light of its history , his participation in the upcoming summer will certainly be uncertain . &quot;
the big shame on this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere had ended the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the previous season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that didn &apos;t heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it wasn &apos;t in conjunction with his an@@ kles or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but as Wen@@ ger also acknow@@ le@@ dges , there is the associated risk of further injury , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases of Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league players in the last five seasons .
&quot; the wider picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 , which have recorded most of the vulner@@ ability . &quot;
Wen@@ ger accepted the potential of a vi@@ cious circle but Arsenal believes that an improvement in the vulner@@ ability rate will last during the last season .
&quot; sometimes when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you have to strengthen your body and win battle strength , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome this .
&quot; I hope that his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal starts its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb ahead of the games against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur next Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger turns a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey travelled not to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta are likely to start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and the players who need it to treat a little break @-@ up , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal has clear favor@@ ites to go through group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
dynam@@ o is also un@@ defeated after 41 games after the &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; campaign has been launched in the last season .
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , judging by the Richter scale 3.2 . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
Wen@@ ger believes that arsen@@ al has drawn up the lesson from the previous season with the Champions League surrender to Monaco and is driven by the far hope to lead the club to its first European Cup triumph with its management .
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked for arsen@@ al .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand , I &apos;m long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
Friend@@ s@@ Fest : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons on men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar portra@@ y@@ als in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up , now even more desperate than ever has become , such as suicide rates among young men on a 15 @-@ year @-@ high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men aged 20 to 45 in Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than in women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to address the problem , Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably announced the year of the man with the aim to question the culture , which prevents men from searching for help when they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study involving more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms noted that when the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with a &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
&quot; but of course you have to have friends , so that friendship can work . &quot;
&quot; in the age of communication led by social media , with its focus on style about substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , fun and successful , even if in reality isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , everything at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our spiritual health much deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy luck . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focus was put on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one by interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler &apos;s frequent hu@@ gs , moments when looking at football in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the longing of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can relate to it , even if they often with@@ hold their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of telephone conversations , I explained : ... &quot; my listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and self @-@ inflic@@ ted has really shown me how even the smallest interactions between friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us often feel unable to talk to friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; I come along with it &quot; has an enormous effect , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness when talking about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
she clearly presents the small moments of male friend@@ ships .
&quot; so much my objective out@@ sider status on the phone may also help people in moments of despair , the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends . &quot;
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Fest this weekend with a completely re@@ designed scenery to celebrate the day , why not take your friends to a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone alone in Star@@ bu@@ cks , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends will be sent to comedy stars from start to finish - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Fest
Maria meets to help PS@@ G to mal@@ ign Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani after his match against Malm@@ ö .
di Maria arrives on Tuesday at his debut in the Champions League on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass to Malm@@ ö .
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ inson Cav@@ ani took course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
&quot; Maria struck less than four minutes after the start of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player , who brought the French Master on the way , but after that they missed a number of occasions before they finally raised their lead when Cav@@ ani scored a top performer in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and Schach@@ t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk , in group A , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , since they are not only aiming for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no clas@@ ses@@ ame of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed opportunities in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club with which he started his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League , so it &apos;s a good start to win 2 : 0 , cause our opponents problems and look back , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; Blanc said . &quot;
&quot; this is a good omen .
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we haven &apos;t scored one or two more goals . &quot;
&quot; after his injury , I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned to the Paris team after his injury , which in the weekend could hold a 2 : 2 draw on his own place against Bordeaux in the first league , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian wing stor@@ mer was referred to as the man who was able to take PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe , when he went in last month by Manchester United , and he pointed out why , when he walked in Marco Ver@@ rat@@ i pass behind the Malm@@ ö defense , before he passed Johan Wil@@ hem nicely into the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this stage , approached An@@ pi@@ ff with nine national players in the field and was armed with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot of Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who went far past Kevin Tra@@ pps poles in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G itself sometimes gave up , with some mis@@ ses and bad connections , not least of I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who had been in the first half alone in the first half and then abandoned after Cav@@ ani had started it after the re@@ boot . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he put his te@@ amm@@ ate into the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c which Di Maria turned into a shooting which was directed by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole ... &quot;
&quot; the second gate finally fell short after the hour brand , thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an achieved his sixth year of the season , after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c had f@@ ished a left flan@@ k of Max@@ well . &quot;
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö had to return to the game , and only an outstanding intervention of Wil@@ and from a very short distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the final result low before replacement players Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi completed a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , Age Har@@ ei@@ de , later admitted that PS@@ G played a class above his team , and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last Champions League game was in December last year . &quot;
since then we have only played in the Swedish league which has not the same level .
the qualifying games are not enough . &quot;
hat off from Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core collects $ 2.5 billion through share sales
&quot; based in Switzerland , Gl@@ en@@ core , based in Switzerland , is affected by the collapse of raw materials , accumulated $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday as part of its huge debt collection plan . &quot;
&quot; in an explanation , the Gl@@ en@@ core registered in London said that it sold new shares worth approximately 1.6 billion pounds to pay its own debts . &quot;
&quot; the company , which has lost 57 percent of its market value this year , fights with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn p@@ ushes demand and has a devastating effect on markets . &quot;
the issue of subscription rights brought the Gl@@ en@@ cores share price to the trading in early Wednesday morning a rapid rise to the top of the London Stock Exchange .
&quot; share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1.@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which was 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; Gl@@ en@@ core last week announced 2.5 billion $ share sale as part of the more comprehensive plans to pay around a third of its $ 30 billion debts . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which represents a 2.4 percent discount on closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have dropped iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other commodity prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

the White House corro@@ bor@@ ates Xi Jin@@ p@@ ings visit to Washington
&quot; Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month , confirmed the White House in an Declaration on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and reci@@ proc@@ ates President Barack Obama &apos;s journey to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;
&quot; the US president and the First Lady Mich@@ elle Obama will also be hosts of Xi and his wife Pen@@ g Li@@ y@@ uan at a State D@@ iner , after the two leaders have held bilateral talks . &quot;
&quot; President xis visit will provide the opportunity to bro@@ aden the American @-@ Chinese collaboration with a number of global , regional and bilateral issues of common interest , but at the same time President Obama and President Xi also have the opportunity to construc@@ tively address areas of dis@@ agreements , &quot; adds the statement . &quot;
&quot; XI , initially announced in February , will likely meet several U.S. technology leaders in Seattle on his way to Washington before moving to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi address a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying in China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;
440 @-@ hp cars bor@@ rowed and driven to scrap

&quot; the sports car suffered total damage , nobody was injured . &quot;
&quot; the material damage is estimated at 40,000 Euros . &quot;
X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented change from FC Bayern in 2008
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; a few years ago , FC Bayern was just ahead of the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who then played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times cup winner , four time Champions League winners , two time champion Champions League , two times European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and switched to the al @-@ S@@ add Sports Club to Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with the Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now advises that he was standing in front of Barcelona before the Euro 2008 . &quot;
they told me that Bar@@ ça would like to sell me .
&quot; Madrid won everything at that time , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and that also registered the FC Bayern .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i : &quot; &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted to have me .
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ dians was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this is working today for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has taken Guardi@@ ola under contract and I have played a great European Championship . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I wouldn &apos;t change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .
&quot; with that he has got me . &quot;
who knows how Bavarian season 2008 / 2009 would run with X@@ av@@ i .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , folded the red out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and celebrated the King &apos;s victory at the end . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays variety in film creation
matt Dam@@ on confronted the American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she is not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; during a series of Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown interrupted the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the cast of the film and not with the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; Brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ ted un@@ belief and shou@@ ted &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay , &quot; as the comment@@ aries of the actor by The Mar@@ tian signed . &quot;
&quot; Dam@@ on and Brown joined the production colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers , in order to discuss the show fin@@ alists . &quot;
&quot; I want to ask people to think about it - whoever will be the director - how to treat the character of Harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ ect beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People , for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio , sat for the directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on said that their direction &quot; at the end could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded against dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter user Mr Po@@ oni squee@@ zed his anger over the clip by writing &quot; &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room so he can explain their variety - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 re@@ we@@ ets and 4,000 Li@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when exact racial representation in the media is at the head of the social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement achieved a nation @-@ wide effect and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to cur@@ b discrimin@@ atory practices against the content . &quot;
in February the singer Prince made a recording of the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year at the Gram@@ my Awards .
&quot; album sil@@ ently matter , &quot; &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; like books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; in recent times , leaders of the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement have released an explanation as a reaction to the question of the Fox News personality Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck whether the group should be viewed as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; the leaders said . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ ets invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos; American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowns the first champion
professional sports climbing and operating assistance Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prix of $ 1 million .
&quot; the contest @-@ show , which just finished its 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant who could complete all stages of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten , to the finale . &quot;
&quot; for the last task , climbing was one 75 feet long climbing rope in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten completed the task within the time he was the first ath@@ lete to finish the exhau@@ sting Phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero completed this challenge full three seconds faster , making him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero said with E ! news after the hard won victory , still under the shock of winning the Grand Prize of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had a life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac e ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the finale and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , won &apos;t receive any prize money . &quot;
&quot; according to the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it receives the great diversi@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has any res@@ ent@@ ment over it .
he is just as happy to have done what he has done .
he received crowds of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me : &quot; &quot; if I should be struck by someone , then I &apos;m happy that it &apos;s Isaac . &quot;
and I think Isaac felt just as if they had changed the roles .
&quot; America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for an eighth season , the shooting will begin in spring 2016 . &quot;
Detroit tiger sne@@ aks over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
MIN@@ NE@@ AP@@ O@@ L@@ IS@@ --@@ The second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are at the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers are reduced to their role as spo@@ iler , but played this part on Tuesday perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in target field . &quot;
the T@@ wins got a chance to climb inside a half of Houston Ast@@ ros for the second American League Wild@@ card slot .
&quot; for Detroit , even if only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F @-@ word , which was so hard to grasp for a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all victories are fun no matter how it is , &quot; &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support when Detroit scored three times in the first two inn@@ ings , then once in sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
&quot; Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) defeated 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings , and allowed three R@@ uns . &quot;
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw at bull@@ pen any game , and therefore I want to go quite concentrated into the game . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger @-@ hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two R@@ uns , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
&quot; it was the first three hit game of Mart@@ ine@@ z , since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6th . &quot;
&quot; he sw@@ ung the sle@@ gh@@ ol@@ z well , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better from the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
with three rings in the back@@ stage at the end of the seventh month the T@@ wins had their best chance to get back to the game .
center Fiel@@ der By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton ended the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ ds Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to Stri@@ ke@@ out before he was replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy over@@ ran wall , the only man with whom he was faced , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer , Miguel S@@ ano , who split the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen into a Two @-@ Run . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing run on the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third bass player Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a double play . &quot;
&quot; it was the 27th time in the Major League , the 27th time this season , that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe hit a double play &quot;
&quot; after Detroit added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inn@@ ings , Wall created a R@@ BI @-@ double against the C@@ loser of Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and scored the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; the right @-@ handed , however , stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three pit@@ ches for his fifth fall . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the game , Detroit was able to benefit from an even non @-@ moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the tig@@ ers scored three R@@ uns in the first two inner ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an , who had been deleted from the game from the injury list after he had been missing for more than a month due to a back pain . &quot;
&quot; obviously not the beginning that I wished for , &quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es said , &quot; but I felt more comfortable than I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter in the first time , there was a single on Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought to the game Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z who made a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the runners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third bass player Nick Castell@@ ano followed a single on the right , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers placed in the second one , achieved a One @-@ Out Double of Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; said T@@ wins manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not hit particularly well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es was in a pitch @-@ count , scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J. A@@ chter . &quot;
&quot; at Hu@@ gh@@ es , there were three hits with six hits and one walk with four strokes . &quot;
notes : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z retired due to a violation of the throwing school .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the San@@ che@@ z shoulder in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is rep@@ ain@@ ted from the list of injuries to launch against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was bought in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
&quot; since August 20 , he has been missing in the right hip joint . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers and T@@ wins will finish their series of three games in the target field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2.@@ 4.@@ 43 ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees are to be accommodated in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people who arrived in it should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city Wiesbaden ha@@ sten@@ ed on Tuesday evening . &quot;
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 refugees arriving .
several sport halls of the Hes@@ sian state capital have been prepared for this case in recent days .
up to 1000 refugees can temporarily stop there .
they should then be distributed to other commun@@ es .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people have arrived in H@@ esse , according to the government president responsible for the first admission . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au also set up emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria are an option
&quot; head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military action with German involvement in Syria for a possibility . &quot;
&quot; I think the decisive thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
he proposed &quot; collective directions &quot; to the European states .
four years ago we were glad that the ch@@ ali@@ ce passed by military participation in Germany .
&quot; now the conflict ends up in front of our front door , &quot; &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to refugees .
Austria controlled at southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has again introduced controls to its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; Austrian interior minister Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV station ORF , declared that no one will be sent back to Hungary . &quot;
Germany too did not send refugees back to Austria .
&quot; no , that is agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; the question of an agreement in which Germany could record a certain number of refugees from Austria a day , said Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
concrete figures did not call them and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in recent days , tens of thousands of refugees had come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan route from Hungary . &quot;
their goal is usually Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week together with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started on Sunday with temporary border controls .
&quot; &quot; &quot; the EU states have so far failed to agree on joint action in the crisis . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers intend to take a new approach to the binding distribution of another 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee crisis in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries more strongly in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , Merkel announced on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Federal Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Merkel under@@ lined that those people who would need protection also g@@ rie@@ ve it . &quot;
&quot; but those who have no perspective , cannot stay in Germany either . &quot;
this assumption was unanim@@ ously shared in the round .
the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now cope with a &quot; enormous effort . &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border with Serbia on Tuesday night .
&quot; a few hours later , the government in Budapest announced the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbouring country is different from Serbia to the EU .
&quot; Hungary wants to prevent smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers from smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers across Romania , said Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to on the planned new border fence . &quot;
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; in Turkey , meanwhile , e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported thousands of other migrants on their way to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
&quot; under the ice p@@ anz@@ er of the Satur@@ n@@ monds En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us , a global ocean sw@@ ells . &quot;
this includes researchers from the observation of the spac@@ ecraft &quot; Cass@@ ini . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the moon is easily ro@@ cking on its orbit around the Ring Plan@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; although this pi@@ geon movement is small , yet too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is stated in a communication from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
the researchers are presenting their analyses in the professional journal &quot; I@@ car@@ us . &quot;
already longer it was known that under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us there must be liquid water .
&quot; thus &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Saturn &apos;s south pole in 2006 , sp@@ ying the water vap@@ or and ice particles and feeding the so @-@ called E @-@ ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least on the South Pole , there must be a sub@@ terranean sea , the astronom@@ ers closed at that time . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing 1860 Munich several weeks
the 1860 München has to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama about one month to the offensive actor Val@@ det R@@ ama .
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old gave an investigation into an ad@@ duc@@ tor injury .
R@@ ama had already compla@@ ined about pain at the beginning of the week .
&quot; according to Munich Li@@ ons , the diagnosis is scheduled for four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; this is hard for us , R@@ ama is a her@@ ber loss . &quot;
&quot; of course we have to think about it , &quot; said sports director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential commitment of a non @-@ aligned professional . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , however , the six@@ ties initially presented a defensive man . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was active in Belgium and was previously under contract with the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at the moment , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the possibility to prove his ability . &quot; &quot;
Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to team training next week after his conc@@ ussion .
the Austrian national player should start running on Thursday already on Thursday .
&quot; in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , Ok@@ to@@ ie was injured in a violent collision . &quot;
&quot; against the first fears , however , he remained without a serious bl@@ es@@ sh@@ ur . &quot;
no fruit diet - man@@ goes contain a lot of sugar
man@@ goes are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
but those who want to pay attention to his slender line will often be dis@@ cour@@ aged by them .
because Man@@ gos contain relatively high sugar - especially su@@ c@@ rose .
&quot; the exotic fruits are healthy nevertheless : in them B vitamins as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor to beta carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; thus , those who eat the fruits are supporting vision , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , Man@@ gos should not be too soft or too strong and can smell pleasantly . &quot;
the shell color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ goes can taste very tasty .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
&quot; however , a man@@ go also gives sa@@ vory food a special note . &quot;
it sof@@ tens the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ ee and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well with fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison . &quot;
the US parcel service U@@ PS again represents up to 9@@ 5000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the USA .
&quot; the company started with the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS issued on Tuesday . &quot;
especially drivers are looked for .
&quot; last year , U@@ PS increased its workforce by 9@@ 5,000 hi@@ ves for the holiday season . &quot;
&quot; given the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its rival F@@ ed@@ Ex have been making arrangements since last year to be ready for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , late deliveries had brought the parcel services to harsh criticism . &quot;
&quot; first cold @-@ storm , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , the F@@ öhn winds into the valleys of the F@@ öhn wind side , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Switzerland hur@@ ried on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and on Thursday night , the hair @-@ dryer sometimes blows with storm strength through the fo@@ eh@@ ole valleys . &quot;
&quot; after finishing on Thursday morning , we cross a striking cold front that brings heavy rainf@@ all , wind gu@@ sts and a decrease in temperature . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently facing an extensive grav@@ ure printing area across the British Is@@ les in a powerful south @-@ west current . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Alps , on the night of Wednesday the fo@@ eh@@ n breaks through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the F@@ öhn winds up until Thursday morning in the fo@@ eh@@ ouses of 60 to 100 km / h , isolated and especially in the Ur@@ ner@@ land partly also with over 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öhn is able to penetrate into the adjacent Mitt@@ ell@@ and , and on the mountains even hurri@@ can@@ es of over 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my blow @-@ dryer ensures summer@@ y temperatures from 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow away at the alpine hill . &quot;
here is the rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; in sum , in the next 48 hours south of the Alps , some 100 litres of rain per square metre must be expected in the next 48 hours , after a large amount of rain has fallen in the last few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning , the f@@ öhn is blowing from the air , in consequence a cold front with strong , partly weather @-@ driven rain from west to east over Switzerland rolls . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind refres@@ hes strong to stor@@ my , and temperatures drop significantly . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand , it will be sunny and warmer at weekends with up to 25 degrees . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther Square
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther Square in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of city president Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o , &quot; he is now honoured as &quot; German The@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot; &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the ancient Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was requested by the working group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that the Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es could only live their faith in the city of Pop@@ es for centuries as a minority . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the pla@@ za becomes visible that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) regarded himself as a young August@@ inian mon@@ k at the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
&quot; at that time , he felt the city as a rotten sin ba@@ bel . &quot;
&quot; according to historians , his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome . &quot;
Luther had then initiated the division of the Western Church with his thes@@ es against the decline .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) thorn crown is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his bi@@ ble .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not with the Ot@@ mar Alt Bible , which has now appeared with gorgeous pictures . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , the image of Ot@@ mar Alt , which in 150 motifs has formulated his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; his &quot; language &quot; with colourful colors and imagin@@ ative forms has received the 75 @-@ year @-@ old , but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; pictures . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite dark . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt worked on his bi@@ ble project for about three years , for which he made a subjective artist selection from the many subject areas of the book of all books . &quot;
&quot; created are cycles that focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds or pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; thus he immediately fascinated several partners : this applies to the Luther @-@ Verlag with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler publishing house , with its focus on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who dealt with the respective Bible passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the biblical passages selected by Ot@@ mar Alt and thus translated into &quot; &quot; today , into current contexts &quot; . &quot; &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
&quot; they are embedded between the original quotation of Martin Luther and each one of the artist , who formul@@ ates his very personal thoughts on the situation . &quot;
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately triggers for the Bible Project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict protest@@ ant Herr@@ n@@ hu@@ ter Order . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ bringing happened already with the cane , &quot; Ot@@ mar Alt recalls . &quot;
&quot; I have tried to work out , to be able to bear me again with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second aim is to return art to more value in the quick@@ est time : &quot; today &apos;s perception of visual worlds is marked by advertisement , and it is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different desire and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants the viewer to &quot; &quot; catch up &quot; &quot; the images , let them work , discover and sense the power they have : &quot; &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was standing on Tuesday at the presentation of the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Bible in the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; always &quot; a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art : &quot; I like how he understands life with his pictures . &quot;
&quot; I did not care to fully grasp the Bible , but chose the most important , also mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here is the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; arose a picture Bible . &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as those of responsibility .
&quot; a part of the origin@@ als - paper and canvas images - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar Alt @-@ Stiftung on 15 November . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X train arrives
&quot; plans were made , company assigned , company mand@@ ated , earth moun@@ ds model@@ ed for a circuit : a year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X track was finished . &quot;
&quot; om@@ issions in politics and administration were responsible for the dr@@ unk@@ enness , especially among the residents who didn &apos;t want to take the train . &quot;

&quot; the approval will go in October , the first parish office Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck was now able to inform her in the children &apos;s and youth affairs committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year is still visible , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should be started with the work of the former indoor swimming pool , without a &quot; &quot; additional pause &quot; . &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga puts a clear sign on the weekend . &quot;
the football team responds to the self @-@ sharpen@@ ing situation in Germany and ass@@ ures the policy of its help in cop@@ ing with the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think that &apos;s the biggest challenge in our country since the re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; there can no one say in principle , that &apos;s not about me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be of interest to each individual to get a grip on this subject , &quot; said DF@@ B CEO Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he wants to intensively discuss the refugee situation in Germany . &quot;
&quot; next Wednesday I went to the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State , Mrs. Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the topic will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football can and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ out has to be policy .
&quot; the German Football Association therefore has expanded its refugee initiative &quot; &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; &quot; four years . &quot;
&quot; we have ensured that this program will continue until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach on the br@@ ink of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
also some federal li@@ gi@@ sts support this program .
&quot; already on this weekend , the 36 professional clubs will put a clear sign when they will &quot; &quot; help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; on the left tri@@ cot @-@ sleeves instead of the usual &quot; &quot; Sponsor@@ ship logos &quot; &quot; ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we want to make it clear that everyone should help wherever and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ us@@ ens Sport@@ boss Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler of the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the refugee tragedy goes to everyone , nobody is allowed to leave . &quot;
&quot; we can use the Bundes@@ liga , no , we have to use our power , influence and possibilities to help the many refugees who have suffered so incredibly , &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent character of the League . &quot;
the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale for the European Quali@@ fication Cup on this Friday .
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large community work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licence agreements had started their own projects in their places was great .
it &apos;s just as great that small and smallest clubs are active there .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we have spent will be lived in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and the next year , the association will jointly provide 300 000 euros for the integration of refugees together with the DF@@ B selection and the German government . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already retri@@ eved the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;
reports : SAP CEO loses eye in accident
&quot; the Executive Board of Europe &apos;s largest software corporation , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , reported that the left eye was lost by a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; after the accident on the stairs in the house of his brother in the USA , he had fallen on a water@@ glass after midnight , which he carried in the left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost blood@@ thir@@ sty , impot@@ ent and then dra@@ gged out onto the street - he told us this last week , &quot; quotes the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
but Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October , we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday issue ) , Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced that he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software group . &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , full of my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the supervisory board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner all the time , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the USA , but since the summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go to the public with such a personal story , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can do something like that . &quot;
it is important to stand up again when you have fallen down .

soccer : Bv@@ B without R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : wil@@ lows f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes of a com@@ eback from Marco R@@ eus in the first group play of the Europa League finally broke down .
the national player will be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar Thursday ( 19@@ .00 h / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately we cannot fall back on it , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ ank@@ o on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach was open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of his professionals , Tu@@ chel will not only change his clan position on the R@@ eus position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door@@ pole position .
&quot; for this reason , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes up the place of family @-@ keeper Roman bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains an absolute top level , &quot; the football teacher praised the World Champion . &quot;
&quot; however , if wil@@ der f@@ eller is used in all European league games in the future , Tu@@ ank@@ le left it open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ ge statement of fellow rac@@ ist R@@ eus , that the final one for the BV@@ B in the Europa League must be the goal , thinks mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for trac@@ e@@ ability : &quot; &quot; this is not so wrong with Marco . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
robot@@ au@@ tos : government wants leadership for Germany
&quot; according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer in the change of the car . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday , the Federal Cab@@ inet adopted a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which included investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday in Frankfurt , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t talked about a &quot; new mobility age &quot; at the Frankfurt Motor Show . &quot;
&quot; automated and networked driving will increase traffic safety and reduce traffic safety , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
&quot; he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries , who also come together with industry representatives at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transport of the Ministry of Transport emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and rapid rise in digital radio communication . &quot;
a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria is currently being developed for testing new technology .
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; no additional liability risks , &quot; the Federal Government wishes to &quot; check the legal framework &quot; and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use itself internationally for increased maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the Federal Government wishes to apply for a change in the Vienna Convention that previously only envis@@ ages human beings as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car increasingly takes the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that record the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study commissioned by the Ministry of Economics , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways by 2020 will be technically possible . &quot;
&quot; despite this , driving cars on public roads are to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot; &quot;
value creation in driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of the passenger can lead to greater safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; said the SPD transport policy S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in case of accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the German self @-@ prop@@ elled cars are still scep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted by the For@@ sa Institute on Wednesday of the For@@ sa Institute on behalf of the Prü@@ for@@ ge Dek@@ ra concludes that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent do not believe in it at all in 20 years . &quot;
&quot; in France , 21 percent of those sur@@ vey@@ ed figure up to 20@@ 25 with autonomous driving cars , in the USA 33 percent . &quot;
&quot; in any case , drivers in Germany are not yet ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; following a survey of the digital channel Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire trip on all roads . &quot;
&quot; at least 15 per cent can be imagined on the motorway , at least 45 per cent in traffic . &quot;
good every fourth would leave the car under no circumstances to the car .
Bol@@ l says team@@ - and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to present status , the Düsseldorf Congress will only strike in singles during the title fight between September 25 and October 4 . &quot;

&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot;
&quot; the guys have experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to clin@@ ch the title even without Timo , &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this point in time , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a long @-@ term agreed sponsorship event in China . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the down@@ side is , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; declared Single European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ char@@ ov . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an en@@ f@@ ant terrible
the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
&quot; highlights : mannequins , which are terri@@ bly human by video projections . &quot;
&quot; they carry the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the great star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
today I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair .
&quot; in the past it was ble@@ ak , meanwhile it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which is to be seen in the Kunsth@@ alle of the Hyp@@ o Cultural Foundation from September 18 , it is a good fortune that the fashion designer has changed his approach to a show of his person . &quot;
&quot; he had actually been on the other hand , because : &quot; &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if you die , you come to the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and in Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s all about so much more than just beautiful dresses , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ des . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
&quot; the exhibits give an insight into the man &apos;s oeu@@ vre , who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship . &quot;
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not built , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which a lot of effort was carried out : for example , to fr@@ o the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator , Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot sent 14 tons of material to Munich . &quot;
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was still a special treat : a leather trousers outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tiers &apos;s old Ted@@ dy is to be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , tent@@ ative fashion tests of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he was not a good student and bad in football ) he put on his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
his parents would not have allowed him to play with a doll .
&quot; later on , he taught the design of fashion himself . &quot;
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and looked at the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
&quot; later I bought them , of course . &quot;
&quot; for his first own fashion show , he did not have to pay the models . &quot;
&quot; they got nothing , but they could keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ er lace as fashion niche
&quot; in the past , it was about the long embroi@@ dery machines in and around P@@ lau@@ en about making meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered fabrics and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which they processed for example to blankets and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; this alone does not work today , explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , Managing Director of the P@@ lau@@ en family . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ en Peak , fashion played a greater role , was then displaced by the home textiles industry - and is now re@@ discovered as a niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt men@@ tions some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories such as bags and for regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; in general , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which re@@ jects past pen@@ cils , is an increasing order potential . &quot;
anyone who has no niche in the textile industry in Germany is no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already do half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; together with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the Association P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s tip and embroi@@ dery . &quot;
only they are allowed to wear the protected label .
&quot; over the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away . &quot;
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , the bulk goods are made much cheaper today in the Asian region and are almost exclusively sold via chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports are weaker , current to Russia and the USA . &quot;
so there are enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also tries to score with environmental awareness as explained by C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer by the Em@@ broi@@ dery Company in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; since this year we have launched a quality seal that shows that we produce ec@@ ologically and socially compatible . &quot;
Rein@@ hardt supplements : &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
graduate designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch of the Z@@ wick@@ au University of Saxony - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and special@@ ises in embroi@@ der@@ ies and tips .
&quot; in order to counter the competition from the Asian region something , you have to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
that takes time and courage .
&quot; there is a tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that have to think economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
that &apos;s why an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to keep a customer base .
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter rev@@ ital@@ ised the historical snow@@ ball lace . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine is sti@@ cking small spheres in some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ en Gold@@ schmi@@ ede@@ meister , Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took the inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; previously , I could not start with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® . &quot;
now she uses the snow@@ ball lace for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic P@@ lau@@ en &apos;s tip - young and old , &quot; Reu@@ ter says . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies us to the USA , Australia and Finland , especially to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who would like to have a mem@@ ento . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as the modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze ® .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie

&quot; however , according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; it is not about a re @-@ movie but a kind of continuation that plays for 20 years after the first film with the magical child girl . &quot;
it is about the experiences of the N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the Great Depression in England .
anyone who plays P@@ opp@@ ins for more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .

XI p@@ ushes to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; the economy has to open itself wider out@@ wards in order to promote growth , said President Xi Jin@@ ping on Tuesday of a group charged with the reform of the reform . &quot;
&quot; China should strive to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Executive Committee for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; encouraging new start @-@ ups and pushing forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and offer new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the Group has adopted a number of guidelines including a negative list to regulate market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the population reporting system . &quot;
&quot; according to the statement , a negative list is created , the sectors and companies that are not eligible for investments . &quot;
the system is tested gradually and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of importance as it as@@ signs a greater role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a right @-@ wing nation@@ alized business environment and making the market more open , said the statement . &quot;
the government will also lo@@ osen controls over the powers transferred to companies and ensure companies decide how they manage their businesses .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas for private investment are opened . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy towards foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of lawyers to exercise their activities , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli also participated in the meeting , as reported in a statement released after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury into large predat@@ ory fish and to supplement consumers with a significantly higher dose of the toxins .
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , which has a corresponding EU working paper , critic@@ ised the plans : &quot; risks and side effects of failed industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force to pregnant women and infants , &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nervous system for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , should be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; however , large predat@@ ory fish are already so heavily poll@@ uted with mercury , that around 50 per cent of the catches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the still valid limits . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be in@@ conceivable . &quot;
&quot; according to F@@ ood@@ watch , the EU wants to shar@@ pen the limit values of 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram according to F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch described this as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p usually so low , are already adher@@ ing to the planned maximum values already today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering at Kl@@ einf@@ all is therefore &quot; a per@@ fi@@ dious diver@@ ting manoeu@@ vre , which helps the economy alone , &quot; explains Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
&quot; mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans , which is heavily enriched over the food chain especially in predat@@ ory fish . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns that &quot; &quot; small amounts can cause particularly in the case of un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry explains on its homepage with regard to the valid maximum values , however , that a &quot; health hazard of the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury gets into the environment mainly by burning coal .
&quot; according to a written information from the Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power plants run out more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total quantity em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish in the Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; &quot; permanent and widespread &quot; , &quot; the &quot; mirror &quot; had been quoted in March from the paper . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequent reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
