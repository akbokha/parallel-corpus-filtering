&quot; a ) To ensure effective implementation of the security measures in accordance with this Convention , the Association of Organisation in accordance with this Convention authori@@ zes Information on Nu@@ clear Material which is subject to security measures , and the characteristics of the facilities necessary to carry out the safety measures relating to this material of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
B ) i ) The organisation requires only the minimum of information and data which is compatible with the implementation of its duties under this agreement .
&quot; ( II ) Information on facilities shall be restricted to the minimum required for the application of safety measures in regard to core material , which is subject to the security measures in accordance with this Convention . &quot;
&quot; C ) In the request of the community , the organization is prepared to evaluate investment data , which the community considers to be particularly vulnerable , in the premises of the community . &quot;
&quot; these data do not need to be materi@@ ally translated , provided that they remain accessible for further examination by the organization in the premises of the community . &quot;
a ) i ) The organization reco@@ vers the consent of the Community and the States to the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors for the states .
&quot; II ) Sub@@ mit the Community either against a proposed nam@@ ing , or at any time against a given designation , the organization of the community and the states proposes one or more alternative denom@@ inations . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the repeated refusal of the Community to appro@@ ve the nam@@ ing of inspec@@ tors of the organization which are imp@@ eded by this convention , the Council will discuss the refusal after the Director General of the Organization - in the following as &quot; the Director General &quot; - has dealt with the aim of meeting appropriate measures . &quot;
&quot; ( B ) The Community and the States concerned shall take the necessary steps to ensure that the inspec@@ tors of the organization can , in fact , provide them with tasks according to their agreement . &quot;
( C ) The visits and activities of the inspec@@ tors of the Organization shall be set up in such a way that i ) are as small as possible the possible har@@ ass@@ ment and distur@@ b@@ ance for the community and the states and for the peaceful nuclear activities underlying the inspection ;
II ) the protection of industrial secrets and other confidential information entrusted to the inspec@@ tors of the organisation .
&quot; each state applies to the organization , including its assets , funds and funds , as well as to their inspec@@ tors and other officials , fulfilling tasks according to this Convention , the corresponding provisions of the Agreement on the Privil@@ eg@@ es and Liberation of the International Atom@@ ic Energy Organization . &quot;
&quot; the security measures according to this agreement are concluded with regard to core material when the Community and the Organization find that the material has been expen@@ ded or dil@@ uted in a manner that it is no longer usable for nuclear activities , which is under the point of view of the securing measures of Bel@@ ang . &quot;
&quot; according to the provisions of this Convention , the Community noti@@ fies the transfer of nuclear material from the states subject to the security measures following this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the security measures in accordance with this Convention shall be terminated with regard to the core material , as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has assumed responsibility for it . &quot;
&quot; the organization carries out documents from which every passing on and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the security measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; the association with the organization of such use of the material , under which circumstances the securing measures can be terminated following this agreement with regard to this material , is to be used in the event of nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics . &quot;
II ) that the candle material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons during the duration of the non @-@ application of the security measures in accordance with this Convention .
&quot; ( B ) The Organization and the Community shall make a provision that the security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall not be applied for as long as the core material is used in such activity .
&quot; in the provision , as far as possible , how long and under what circumstances these safegu@@ ards are not applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the safety measures envis@@ aged in this Convention will once again apply once the nuclear material is returned to a peaceful nuclear operation . &quot;
the organisation is held on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and composition of this material in the state or the concerned state and on any passing on such material from this state or these states .
&quot; this explains their agreement as quickly as possible ; it only extends to matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural provisions and agreements for the reporting , but does not include approval or under sec@@ rec@@ y knowledge of the military activity and does not refer to the un@@ successful use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in carrying out their respective obligations under the Convention . &quot;
&quot; the association , the states or persons subject to their jurisdiction , but extraordinary costs arising from a special request of the organization , the organization reimbur@@ ses these costs as long as it has been prepared beforehand . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organisation bears the cost of all additional measurements and samples required by the inspec@@ tors of the organization . &quot;
&quot; the Community and the States ensure that the liability for nuclear damage , including insurance or other financial security , may be used in accordance with its laws and other provisions , to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this convention in the same manner as on the nation@@ alities of the states . &quot;
&quot; any claim that the community or state shall assert vis @-@ à @-@ vis the organization or the organization vis @-@ à @-@ vis the community or a state for damages - with the exception of damages arising from a nuclear incident , which resulted from the implementation of the security measures in accordance with this Convention , is governed by international law . &quot;
&quot; after examination of the relevant information provided by the General Director , the Council determines that no core material , which has to be subject to security measures in accordance with this Convention , shall reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II paragraph C of the Stat@@ utes and , if necessary , take the other measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council will take into account the extent to which weight has been acquired by the applied safety measures and offers the community or the state - as far as each of the two contractual parties is affected - every reasonable opportunity to provide the Council with the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; consultation of the organization , community or state will be consul@@ ted on questions arising from the interpretation or application of the Convention . &quot;
the Community and the States are entitled to seek out that questions arising from the interpretation or application of the Convention shall be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the community and the affected state to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; with the exception of any dispute referred to by the Council pursuant to Article 19 or a measure taken by the Council , any dispute arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be settled upon the request of a party to submit an arbit@@ ral tribunal which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the community and the states design@@ ate two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also names two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators elect a fifth who presi@@ ded . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and the States or the Organization have not nominated two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the request for arbit@@ ration , the community or organisation may seek to appoint the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint these arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
the same procedure applies if within thirty days after the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected .
a majority of the members of the arbit@@ ral tribunal shall be competent and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators .
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ration Court are binding for the organisation , the community and the states concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) The Convention shall come into force for non @-@ nuclear weapons States , the contracting party of the contract and become members of the Community ( in force , i ) if the State of the Organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of the Convention and &quot;
&quot; ( II ) If the Community of the Organization noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures in relation to this state , for the purposes of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The Organization , the Community and the States consult each other on the request of one of the Parties to the amendment of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; B ) All amendments require the consent of the Organization , the Community and the States . &quot;
C ) The General Director shall immediately inform all Member States of the Organization of any amendment to this Convention .
&quot; ( a ) The Convention shall enter into force on the day that the organization of the Community and the States shall receive the written notification , that their procedures are concluded for entry into force . &quot;
this Convention shall remain in force as long as the states are contracting party of the contract .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Convention &quot; &quot; used in this agreement signi@@ fies the agreement and the protocol . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of this part of the Convention is to determine the procedures applicable in the implementation of the provisions of Part I regarding preventive measures , such as necessary . &quot;
the aim of the procedures of the security measures specified in this Convention is the timely discovery of distributing significant quantities of nuclear weapons of peaceful nuclear activities for the production of nuclear weapons and other nuclear weapons for unknown purposes as well as deter@@ rence from such a junction by the risk of premature discovery .
&quot; in order to reach the target specified in Article 28 , material accounting is used as a preventive measure of fundamental importance , con@@ stit@@ uting with the spatial confin@@ ement and monitoring as important supplementary measures . &quot;
&quot; the technical completion of the ex@@ ams by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity , which is not proven for a certain period of time , is specified with the accuracy limit for the specified Me@@ gen . &quot;
&quot; in carrying out their investigations , the organization makes up for Article 3 full use of the security system of the Community . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nu@@ clear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of its preventive measures , the Community of de procedures and measures of the following kind will make use of it and , as far as necessary , see how they are more determined and appropriate in the supplementary agreements : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measurement system for determining the quantities of preserved , produced , lost , lost or otherwise derived from the stock and inventory ; &quot;
B ) the assessment of reprodu@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and estim@@ ation of measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) procedures for determination , testing and assessment of differences in the measurements of transm@@ it@@ ters and recipients ; &quot;
( e ) procedures for the evaluation of accum@@ ulations of non @-@ measured continu@@ ances and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; ( F ) a protocol and reporting system , which for each material balance zone has the core material inventory and the changes in this inventory including the one and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
precau@@ tions to ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) procedures for the reimbur@@ sement of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the security measures in accordance with this Convention do not extend to material in mining or ore processing .
&quot; a phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) is introduced into the states , so the community of the organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specifically non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; it leaves core material , which is suitable for the composition and purity for the production of fuel or the is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the plant or the process phase in which it is made , or becomes the core material produced in the states in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle , so it is subject to the other safety measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the security measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions stated in Article 11 . however , if the prerequ@@ isites mentioned in Article 11 are not authorised , the Community is however , of the opinion that the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to this Convention , is not possible or desirable from residues , so consult the organization and the community about the application of appropriate security measures . &quot;
&quot; B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be terminated for core material under the conditions specified in Article 13 , provided that the organization and the Community agree , that this core material is practically non @-@ re@@ cover@@ able . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Community , the Organization shall release the following core material from the security measures following this agreement : &quot;
a ) special fis@@ sile material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; ( B ) Nu@@ clear material , if used in non @-@ nuclear activities according to Article 13 , if such nuclear material is re@@ cover@@ able , and &quot;
&quot; pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 2@@ 38 , which is over 80 % . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the community , the organisation exemp@@ ts core material which would otherwise be subject to security measures under this Convention , from these preventive measures , provided the whole , due to this article in the States , amounts to no more than at any time more than &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special p@@ alt@@ able material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calcul@@ ates by the multip@@ lication of its weight by enrich@@ ment , &quot;
III ) ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment which is less than 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium calcul@@ ates by multi@@ plying its weight with the five @-@ fold square of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) twenty metric tons of depl@@ eted ur@@ anium with an accumulation of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; should the material delivered or stored together with the core material which is subject to the protection measures in accordance with this Convention shall be processed or stored , precau@@ tions shall be taken for the re@@ use of the security measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the Community coinci@@ des with the organization of supplementary agreements , which in the scope which is required for the successful and effective support of the tasks of the organization according to this Convention shall determine in detail how to apply the procedures laid down in the Convention . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or altered without amendment of this agreement in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the organization , the community and the states undertake all efforts to allow these agreements to enter into force within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this agreement ; an extension of this period requires the agreement between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report outlined in Article 62 , the organization implements a comprehensive inventory of inventory of the entire repository underlying the security measures of this agreement in the states , irrespective of its origin , and carries on this inventory based on the subsequent reports and the results of its investigations . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( EEC ) and its Member States Belgium , Denmark , Federal Republic of Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , Netherlands , United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) on the other &quot;
&quot; ( a ) The EEC has decided to contribute to the special action programme specified at the Conference on International Economic Cooperation , in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low income , whose development is ham@@ pered by common res@@ titu@@ tion problems . &quot;
&quot; C ) It is the aim of the EEC and the Member States that the entire contribution of the Member States is bound by the agreement within six months of entry into force of the agreement , and as far as possible within two years after entry into force in the form of loans , and the organization will allow its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
D ) The EEC and the Organization have consul@@ ted each other on the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the mean bonds to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the organization of the EEC has presented a table that is pur@@ pos@@ ely intended to apply the criteria set out in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization arran@@ ges a special account under the name &quot; &quot; Special En@@ ac@@ tional Account &quot; , &quot; which will contribute to the member states in accordance with this agreement to the special action account . this account is managed and used by the organization as a car@@ et@@ aker ( in this property the organization is referred to as &quot; &quot; car@@ et@@ aker &quot; &quot; ) , and only to the purpose specified in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the special action account is managed separately and separated from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or non @-@ interest notes of the member state to pay upon request in the currency of the respective state at Order of the organization as the administrator of the special action account and to be deposited in the organisation of the organization in the country concerned .
B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments ( i ) the first in the amount of at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of the entry into force of this agreement or to another between the EEC and the appointed time ;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the remaining amount of the contribution to January 1 , 1979 or at any other time agreed between the EEC and the bai@@ li@@ ff considering the periods required for parliamentary approval of the annual budget@@ ary plans . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach member state may request the payments in advance of the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; according to the usual procedures of the organization , the administrator takes approximately proportional moves to the cash or the school notes to cover the expenses for the special transaction loans and to compensate for the special action account in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; when granting this loan , the administrator can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the EEC : &quot;
III ) the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the current and fores@@ eeable economic problems of the country ;
( VI ) the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its further lending capacity to loan terms without dis@@ approval ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the respective countries can be regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special action loan is used to finance a clearly outlined and rapidly exten@@ dable development program or project ( including a sec@@ toral proposal ) , which is considered , approved , approved and managed for the loan program of the organization , according to the procedures and practices applied to the objective of the endor@@ sement mentioned under the letter b ) of the pre@@ am@@ ble to this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the means of the special action account must not be used instead of ordinary funds by the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from Section 4 , special transaction loans are subject to the same pay@@ back conditions that are generally applicable to the loan granted by the organization ; therefore , they are re@@ payable in 10 years each in 50 years . &quot;
transaction Lo@@ ans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States and are re@@ payable in these currencies .
amounts for payment of this duty are to be paid directly to the organization that retains it .
&quot; any special action loan is to be issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the administrator , in which , in particular , the origin of the means is given . &quot;
&quot; the revenues from each special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services produced or rendered in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which may be members of the organization and which may be the recipient of a loan granted at the time of loan granted . &quot;
the amount of capital re@@ payments made by a special action loan is made on the special transaction account and the amount paid in the currency of a member state shall be re@@ mitted as soon as possible by the administrator to the Member State .
the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the EEC regarding the projects and programs approved by the directors until full awar@@ ding of all the special transaction loans .
&quot; during the time of withdrawal of the special transaction loan , the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the EEC quar@@ terly on the development of the special transaction loan and the expenses for this . &quot;
&quot; as soon as possible after completion of the financial year of the organisation , the administrator shall submit a detailed billing of the special transaction account with a statement from the external audi@@ tor of the organization on this account . &quot;
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the administrator of the EEC transfers a detailed report on the projects and programs financed by the special action account as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; the administrator creates and performs appropriate records and accounts from which the contributions to the special transaction account , which are issued from the account recei@@ pts , and the amounts paid to the account and the withdraw@@ als made to the member states . &quot;
the EEC and the car@@ et@@ aker work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; for this purpose , the EEC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issue of the means of the special action account , lead to an exchange of ideas on the state of the special action account , the progress of the programs or projects financed by special ac@@ tion@@ aries and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; this agreement was not entered into force on 31 December 1978 , or at a later date , which the EEC and the Organization may , if necessary , entered into force , so the agreements and all obligations of the parties shall become invalid with immediate effect . &quot;
&quot; if the total amount of capital paid by the bene@@ fici@@ aries in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement has been rep@@ aid and transferred to Member States , this agreement and all obligations of the parties are terminated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires approval by the individual Member States and the EEC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States notified the General Sec@@ retariat of the Council of the European Communities the conclusion of the proceedings concerned .
the Sec@@ retariat direc@@ ts these noti@@ fications along with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this agreement by the EEC .
this agreement is effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the date of receipt of the mentioned noti@@ fications in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is written in two tran@@ scripts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch , with each wording equally engaging . &quot;
&quot; whereas the agreement in the form of a letter to change the An@@ nex A of Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) is to be concluded , HA@@ T en@@ acted : &quot;
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ P@@ Ä@@ IS@@ CHE Atom@@ ic Energy Community , herein@@ after called Eur@@ atom , represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after called &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after called &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after called the Federal Council , &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large testing facility , the J@@ ET ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) project , whose construction and operation will be transferred to a Joint undertaking pursuant to Chapter V of Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after called &quot; Joint Venture J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
Switzerland has been concerned with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics for several years and is well acquainted with the area concerned .
&quot; as far as the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion is yet to carry out extensive work , it is in the interest of the parties of the present agreement to summ@@ on their respective efforts to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research efforts , which have achieved a higher priority level due to the energy crisis . &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable any contracting party to gain the greatest benefit by merging its research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics from the funds provided for both research work , i.e. the cost @-@ moder@@ ately competitive power generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction , faster . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the contracting parties associate their respective research programmes under An@@ nex I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after called Eur@@ atom Programme and the Swiss Programme . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure effective cooperation , the Swiss program takes over the long @-@ term objectives and forms of co @-@ operation of Eur@@ atom &apos;s program ; it will be extended or amended by the organs mentioned in Articles 5 to 10 and Article 16 of the present agreement , which may include new activities relevant to Eur@@ atom &apos;s program . &quot;
&quot; each time the contractual parties accept a new program , this shall be replaced by the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
&quot; the association , envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 , is realized by : - appropriate participation of each of the parties involved in the preparation and implementation of the programs of the other party ; &quot;
&quot; - Exchange of staff among the relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom member states , Switzerland and the third countries , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , as well as the laboratories working on Eur@@ atom &apos;s program ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the respective programmes .
&quot; as part of the objective of the present agreement , Switzerland is participating in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association agreement provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of this Agreement , the contracting parties call an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those concluded between the Commission and the States and companies or individuals , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; association bodies , &quot; with regard to the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same aim Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved in the agreement on the promotion of personnel exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the associated bodies , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; &quot; Agreement on Human Resources &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is a member of the J@@ ET joint venture with the time of the entry into force of the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland can become a contractual partner of any contract with its objective in the framework of the present agreement , with the exception of association agreements or other similar contracts concluded by Eur@@ atom during the period of validity of the present agreement . &quot;
the bodies involved in carrying out the association provided in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
&quot; the association agreement , in particular , should include the suspension of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
- to monitor the development of the research work and to direct the best possible results in line with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by a maximum of two delegates in the connection group used within the Eur@@ atom Programme - in the following &quot; VG . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure the exchange of information and cooperation in all matters concerning ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of Eur@@ atom &apos;s programme , this task is true of all research and development activities to which this agreement relates . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes co @-@ operation and coordination between the associated organs and addresses their T * uniqu@@ eness in the interests of the two parties involved in the Eur@@ atom Programme and in the Swiss program as well as the common objective set out in Article 1 of the present agreement , whereby the scientific and technological developments in the world will be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; according to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , VG ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the advisory groups created within the Eur@@ atom Programme , whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are seeking . &quot;
&quot; the advisory groups , who submit to the VG research proposals for the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom Programme , take this task as regards all research and development work that is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the scope of the Eur@@ atom Programme , Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories involved . &quot;
&quot; the Committee of Directors , who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme , and who is responsible for optimally util@@ ising the capacities of the laboratories that are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the programme , provide this task with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides for the best possible use of the personnel and for the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme and the Swiss Programme . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all coordin@@ ating committees used within the Eur@@ atom Programme .
&quot; the coordination committees , which provide the directors with appropriate proposals for the best possible use of the resources , staff , knowledge and skills that are involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom Programme , take this task in the respective field with regard to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; BA@@ F is a representative of every member state of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and any affiliated third country responsible for core and energy research . &quot;
&quot; at the request of the Commission , the BA@@ F consul@@ ts the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and the preparation of future programs and the preparation of the future programs and definition of their overall volume , coordination and integration of national activities at community level within the scope of the merger . &quot;
&quot; the statements of the BA@@ F , the VG , the Board of Directors , the advisory groups and the coordination committees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;
the opinion of the VG on the urgent actions is obligatory ; the same applies to the Committee of Directors in the field of personnel exchange .
the representatives of the two contractual parties work on the works of all technical advisory boards or all administrative bodies that are created for the purpose of the present agreement .
the Swiss financial contribution to Eur@@ atom &apos;s programme according to this agreement is set annually to an amount that is at the same rate as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland compared to the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland last year .
&quot; concerning the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the Common Market as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland comm@@ its J@@ ET to the common company J@@ ET , which is to be determined according to the terms of the rules of the Stat@@ ute of this Common Company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom provides for funding the work within the framework of the association agreement and the agreement on personnel exchange , is calculated on the same basis , which is normally used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to the financing of the works based on the corresponding contracts . &quot;
the Commission shares the Federal Council at the beginning of the year with the amount to cover expenses within the Eur@@ atom Programme for the year concerned .
the Federal Council will pay the commission due to this amount as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15th .
July . the remaining payment methods for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom according to this article are specified in An@@ nex III of the present agreement .
&quot; Switzerland will take all necessary measures to exemp@@ t Eur@@ atom from customs or other donations as well as import duties and restrictions to the part of the objects funded by Eur@@ atom , which shall be used in Switzerland for activities within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Switzerland , the goods acquired or acquired there may not be dispos@@ ed of roy@@ alty or free of charge in this country unless approved by the Federal Council . &quot;
these liber@@ ations are not applicable to the rest of the rest and the l@@ ent paid by these persons .
&quot; the provisions governing the access to the knowledge envis@@ aged for the association designated in Article 2 paragraph 1 of the present Agreement shall be governed in Article 14 and 15 of this agreement , in association agreement and in the agreement on the exchange of personal data . &quot;
the provisions on access to the knowledge that apply to the participation of Switzerland at the Joint Venture J@@ ET are regulated in Article 14 of this agreement and in the Stat@@ ute of the Common Company .
the right of any contracting party to access to the knowledge of the other party is an integral part of this agreement .

the parties of the Convention to carry out Article VII of the Universal Law and Trade Agreement - herein@@ after referred to as the Convention -
&quot; in view of the multi@@ lateral trade negotiations and the request issued by the Committee on Trade negotiations at its meeting of 11 . and 12 April 1979 , the desire to arrive at a uniform version of an agreement to implement Article VII of the Universal tari@@ ff and trade agreement , &quot;
considering that Article 27 of the Convention concerning Chan@@ ges has not entered into force - I
agree to cancel the provisions of Article 1 ( 2 b ) i@@ v ) of the Convention ;
2 . realize that the postpon@@ ement of the application of the application of this Convention by five years according to Article 21 ( 1 ) may be inadequate in practice for some developing countries .
&quot; in such cases , a development country , the contracting party , may apply for an extension of this period before the deadline stated in Article 21 ( 1 ) , whereby the parties agree that such an application in cases where the development country can provide good reasons ; &quot;
&quot; 3 . recognise that developing countries , which at the present conduct customs value determination on the basis of fixed minimum values , if necessary , intend to maintain these values for a limited transition period under conditions and conditions to which the contractual parties agree to be retained ; &quot;
&quot; 4 . recognize that developing countries that consider revers@@ ing the order of application upon request of the leader in accordance with Article 4 , may have the desire to make the following reservation to article 4 : &quot;
the Government of : ... reserves the right to declare that the relevant provision of Article 4 applies only if the customs authorities apply the application of Article 5 and 6 in reverse order .
&quot; make developing countries such reservations , so the contractual parties agree to this reservation in accordance with Article 23 of their consent ; &quot;
5 . realize that developing countries may have the wish to make the following reservation to article 5 paragraph 2 :
&quot; the Government of ... reserves the right to declare that Article 5 paragraph 2 of the Convention shall be applied in accordance with the relevant note , even if the complain@@ ant has not submitted an appropriate request . &quot;
&quot; make developing countries such reservations , so the contractual parties agree to this reservation in accordance with Article 23 of their consent ; &quot;
&quot; 6 . recognize that some developing countries have asser@@ ted the concern that in carrying out Article 1 of the Convention , problems may arise as far as they are referred to by sole propriet@@ ors or sole conc@@ es@@ sion@@ aire imports into their countries . &quot;
&quot; the parties agree that in the case of occurrence of such problems in practice in developing countries , which apply the Convention on the application of these countries , an investigation of this question is carried out to find suitable solutions ; &quot;
&quot; 7 . agree that Article 17 acknow@@ le@@ dges that customs administr@@ ations must carry out investigations in the application of the Convention if necessary investigations , in order to convince themselves of the correctness or accuracy of information , explanations or documents issued for customs value determination . &quot;
&quot; they also agree that the article acknow@@ le@@ dges that studies can be carried out with which , for example , whether the inch in connection with a customs value determination is complete and correct . &quot;
&quot; they acknowledge that contractual parties , subject to their national legislation and procedures , have the right to count on the full participation of the complain@@ ants in these investigations ; &quot;
&quot; 8 . agree that the actual paid or paid price includes all payments which , as a condition for the purchase transaction , shall be paid by the buyer to the seller or by the buyer to a third party for the purpose of a buyer &apos;s obligation to be paid or to be paid . &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; I honor the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to define provisions on the import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the community . &quot;
&quot; - fresh or cooled H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; as part of this agreement , the export opportunities for amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina to the community are set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in car@@ c@@ ass weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the amount of the agreed volume does not exceed the agreed quantity and is executed according to conventional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the supply form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult one another before the introduction of such a change in the Committee mentioned under number 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes advantage of the protection clause , it comm@@ its itself to ensure that the access to Argentina &apos;s access to the common market is not touched by this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina exceed the agreed quantities in one year , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year concerned . &quot;
the Community obli@@ ges itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of products covered by this agreement to a ho@@ of rate of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the course of the entry of new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina will change the quantity of Argentina under number 2 corresponding to the volume of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; on this occasion , the ho@@ ech@@ st set of de@@ ple@@ tion referred to under number 5 shall be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the total amount mentioned under number 2 is determined on the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 23@@ ,000 tonnes of slaughter . &quot;
the community takes all to avoid a market development that could imp@@ air the marketing of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the common market within the agreed quantities .
&quot; in particular , the Community is taking precau@@ tions so that the sales of frozen meat on frozen meat is not under@@ mined because of the implementation of the Regulation on the he@@ el of Argent@@ ine H@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as for slaughter of certain living sheep and lamb shall only be made in accordance with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms can be interpreted in a manner compatible with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 ( 2 ) of the Convention on the interpretation and application of Articles VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General customs and trade agreement . &quot;
&quot; in Argentina , adher@@ ence to this agreement , in particular , ensures that the quantities specified in this agreement are provided for export licenses for the products listed under number 1 . &quot;
&quot; the Community is obliged to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in Argentina is made dependent on the submission of an export licence , which is designated by the responsible authority designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit for obtaining the import licence for the products in question cannot be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in addition , it is stipul@@ ated that the responsible Argent@@ ine@@ an authority shall notify the competent authority of the community at regular intervals for which export licenses have been issued ; this information may be conclu@@ sively en@@ code to the destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; he regularly reviews the trend on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of both parties and on the world market , as well as the sales conditions on these markets including conditions which are of importance for the above @-@ mentioned objective . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the correct application of this agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat under the agreement will not be carried out by the Community . &quot;
the Committee discusses all questions arising from the implementation of this agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement do not harm the rights and obligations of the parties within the scope of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; the annual quantity , which is set under number 2 , is valid for the period from January 1 to January 31 . &quot;
&quot; the amount paid by the entry into force of this agreement to January 1 of the following year shall be set in proportion to the total annual amount , and will take account of the seasonal character of the trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 ; after that date , it remains in force , subject to the right of every party to termin@@ ate it in writing within a period of one year . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be verified by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary for necessary . &quot;

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to define provisions on the import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the Regulation on a Common Market Organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; recognizing the fact that the sheep farming and the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb according to the world market and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy is vital and that it is necessary to ensure that the normal sales of New Zealand &apos;s H@@ amm@@ el and lamb are not affected by these markets , I honour the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , New Zealand will be granted access to the community &apos;s market in the amount specified in the agreement for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
new Zealand receives assurance that the normal he@@ el of its hammer and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is committed to ensuring that the actually executed annual quantity does not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the set @-@ up amounts are executed in the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments or maintaining its competitive position on the community market .
&quot; should a change in the supply form be possible as a result of changes in technology and trade , the two contractual parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in clause 10 above , in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community takes advantage of the safeguard clause , it comm@@ its itself to protect the interests of New Zealand from this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from New Zealand exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the Community obli@@ ges itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion to imports of goods collected from this agreement to a ho@@ of set of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; in the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand changes the volumes set in clause 2 according to the volume of New Zealand trade with each new Member State . &quot;
&quot; the import charges for these new Member States shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of the Acc@@ ession Treaty ; in this case , the Ho@@ ech@@ st set of de@@ ple@@ tion stipul@@ ated in clause 5 shall be taken into account . &quot;
the total amount mentioned in clause 2 is determined on the day of Greece &apos;s accession to the Community to 2@@ 45 500 tons of slaughter .
&quot; the community takes up everything to prevent market development , which could imp@@ air the normal sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community will take precau@@ tions so that sales of frozen meat in frozen meat will not under@@ mine due to the implementation of the ordin@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two contractual parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of Schaff@@ haus@@ er in the community without danger to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual application of re@@ funds or other funding measures for the export of H@@ amm@@ el and lamb as well as for slaughter of certain living sheep and lamb shall only be made in accordance with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of community on world trade with these products . &quot;
new Zealand guarantees compliance with the quantities mentioned in clause 2 in particular that there is no export license beyond these quantities .
&quot; the Community is obliged to take all necessary precau@@ tions , so that the issu@@ ance of import lic@@ ences for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand is made dependent on the submission of an export licence , which is notified by the responsible authority notified by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details of the application of this system are determined in such a way that the position of a security deposit for obtaining the import licence for the products in question cannot be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in addition , it is stipul@@ ated that the competent authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals provides the quantities for which export licenses have been issued ; this information may be conclu@@ sively en@@ code to the destination country . &quot;
the Committee shall ensure that the agreement is properly applied and works smoothly .
&quot; the Committee regularly reviews the trend on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat market of the two contractual parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets including conditions which are of importance for the aforementioned objective in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the correct application of the agreement will not be affected by the fact that products made of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat under the agreement will not be carried out by the Community . &quot;
&quot; the Committee discusses all questions arising from the implementation of the agreement , presented to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this Agreement do not harm the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the scope of the G@@ AT@@ T .
&quot; the annual amount stated in clause 2 shall be valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount , which is expected from the entry into force of this agreement , shall be set in relation to the total annual amount . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community is applied , and on the one hand and for New Zealand &apos;s main territory on the one hand and on the other . &quot;
&quot; this agreement enters into force on 20 October 1980 . it is valid until 31 March 1984 . after this date , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year . in any case , the provisions of this agreement will be reviewed by both parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they consider necessary . &quot;
&quot; I urge you to suggest , if your government can agree to the above , that this letter and your response together form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot;
&quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to define provisions on the import of h@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the Regulation on a Common Market Organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat . &quot;
the set @-@ up amounts are executed in the conventional supply forms ( frozen or cooled ) .

&quot; C ) which are not free from diseases transmitted by blood trans@@ fu@@ sions , as far as this can be ensured by simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; blood withdrawal is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is gli@@ des into a sterile bottle with a closed , sterile tube system into which the anti @-@ coag@@ ulation solution before ster@@ ility has been authorised . &quot;
&quot; after the end of the blood withdrawal , the bottle is immediately closed and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C. After this , it must be re @-@ opened immediately before using the blood . &quot;
&quot; the anti @-@ coag@@ ulation solution should not exceed 220 ml per litre of human whole blood , and the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration must not exceed 97 g per litre . &quot;
the blood group after the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system is to be determined beforehand by the blood cells and the serum ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; as far as there are standardized or recommended procedures for the blood group determination in individual countries , these are to be applied . &quot;
&quot; the designation R@@ h @-@ neg@@ atively is only to be used , if specific studies have sur@@ rendered the absence of the anti@@ gens C , D , Du und E . &quot;

&quot; human thorou@@ gh@@ bred is to store in sterile , closed bottle against micro@@ organisms and to keep up to its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are allowed only during the time required for testing and transport , which must at most 30 minutes be allowed to cool down again to 4 to 6 C. &quot;
a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human thorou@@ gh@@ bred that the largest part of the plasma has been removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been obtained ; other blood cell components may be present or may have been partially removed .
the liquid content of the concentrate exists either from the rest of the plasma or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial wat@@ ery solution which was added after removing the plasma .
&quot; the volume of red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , if a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , the approximate percentage of ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ it ) is indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for production must be carried out under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the support must be carried out using a sterile , closed system and only through pressure . &quot;
an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added to indicate their volume and composition on the label .
&quot; human dry plasma is extracted by drying out the liquid , which is deposited at the top of the centri@@ fu@@ ges or sedi@@ mentation of human solid blood . &quot;
human dry plasma is obtained through cold drying or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water , which corresponds to the liquid quantity , from which one went out in the production of the substance . &quot;
&quot; the protein concentration of the solution won &apos;t be less than 45 g per litre , and the solution must not contain any visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis products . &quot;
donations in which ( using a fresh wine tasting ) have been established a dangerous content of in@@ sole em@@ ol@@ ys@@ in or immune her@@ me@@ ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ine are excluded .
&quot; if the plasma is not mixed and frozen within 48 hours after the blood withdrawal , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to eliminate the harmful effects of bacterial growth products in plasma , blood donations , which exhibit signs of a bacterial infection , are not used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be proven in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of transmission of I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation hepatitis , compounds that do not contain more than 12 donations are to be used , or to apply other methods which are known to reduce this risk in a comparable manner . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid quantity , from which one went out during the production of the plasma , is to be added ; the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C. &quot;
&quot; a given quantity plasma is dissolved in the quantity of water , which corresponds to the liquid quantity from which it was produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; 1 ml solution requires sufficient amount of thro@@ mb@@ in or calcium chlori@@ de , so the process can be accelerated ; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ furnace at 37 C. &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ hour drying process in the presence of phosphor@@ us @-@ pent@@ oxi@@ d under a pressure of at most 0,@@ 02 mm mercury , loss of weight loss of over 0.5 % should not occur in human dry plasma . &quot;

a re@@ agent for blood group determination must react with all tested blood samples containing the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olog@@ ous to the antibody or another substance indicated on the label .
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the recommended way by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ oly@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured twice in a suitable medium due to the repeated di@@ lution of the re@@ agent to be examined .
the Tit@@ er is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of the strongest ser@@ um@@ - th@@ inning in which a reaction occurs ; th@@ inning is calculated exclusively from the volume of the blood cells in@@ undation in the total volume .
&quot; in Anti @-@ A , Anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents that are to be used on slides , the activity is expressed by the time required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organisation has set up International Standards for Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for the blood group determination , and re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are developed at present standards . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the titles observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination of most specific@@ ity is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ational , which is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation . &quot;
the ti@@ ter den@@ otes the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the last mixture within a series where a micro@@ scopic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood group determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( at the time anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as in@@ complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown agent in comparison to the International standard preparation or a state standard preparation in International Units ( See Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 30@@ 1 . ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring them back to a volume of 1 ml , then the Anti @-@ A and Anti @-@ B S@@ ers contain 256 International units per ml . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Laboratory for Bi@@ ological Standards of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institut , Copenhagen . &quot;

&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the conditions recommended by the manufacturer , the required properties shall remain for at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ iry date of a re@@ agent in liquid form according to the label is at most one year after the last satisfying efficacy test .
the exp@@ iry date for dry re@@ agents indicated on the label depends on the results of the durability tests ; it is approved by the state supervisory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or vacuum , in the glass container in which they have been dried and which is thus sealed so that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 per cent of its weight if it is tested by further drying over phosphor@@ us @-@ pent@@ oxi@@ d at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the competent state authority may determine that the agent ( or the solvent supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is added to an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided that the agent with the added substance continues to fulfill the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy . &quot;
sera human origin for blood group identification must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein nitrogen per ml fluid or re@@ dissolved ser@@ ums .
&quot; re@@ agents , whether in liquid form or after re @-@ resolution , must be transparent and must neither contain sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents for the international exchange of re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination should not be colored arti@@ fici@@ ally as far as possible , at least until an international agreement has reached a uniform system . &quot;
re@@ agents for blood @-@ group determination can be distributed in such a way and in such quantities that the re@@ agent in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to carry out tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the quantity contained in a container must be so large that the content may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturer &apos;s laboratory has written records of all stages and checks of re@@ agents for blood group identification .
adequate samples of all re@@ agents issued can be stored as long as possible from the laboratory until it can be assumed that the batch is no longer used .
&quot; re@@ agents used for blood @-@ group identification contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of them represent the effective proportion , the others are the necessary tools to strengthen the effectiveness and maintain the stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
for technical reasons these re@@ agents are divided according to the origin of their effective stake in three groups .
&quot; this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin contain only substances of human origin , or that animal or vegetable re@@ agents contain no substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; a black on white printed label can be attached to each container in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; the quantity or , with dried re@@ agents , the quantity and composition of the liquid needed for re@@ covering , &quot;
&quot; in addition , this label or label on the box in which the individual containers are located or the instructions included in the containers include : 1 . full name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;

&quot; in no case , the effectiveness of the serum can amount to less than 64 international units per ml . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5@@ - to 10 percent in@@ undation of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2 and A2@@ B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination should occur in any in@@ undation within the double time required when the same attempt is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group or a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of selected individuals in group A , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or by specific substances of group B. &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells containing no B @-@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group serum or a corresponding compar@@ ator against an in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object bearer with a similar amount of a 5 to 10 % in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time necessary if the same attempt is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) serum is obtained from the blood of selected individuals in group 0 , which can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of group A and group B. &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( group 0 ) Ser@@ um ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing Ag@@ glut@@ ton@@ gene A and / or B , i.e. those of group A including sub@@ groups A1 and A2 of group B and group AB including sub@@ groups A1 and A2 , i.e. those of group 0 , i.e. those of group 0 . &quot;
it ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells that contain the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) an@@ tigen ( which are generally not ag@@ glut@@ inated by Anti @-@ A serum of the group B ) .

&quot; in no case , the effectiveness of the serum can amount to less than 64 international units per ml . &quot;
un@@ dil@@ uted Anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( Gruppe 0 ) Blood serum also has to cause an easily recognizable ag@@ glut@@ ination of the blood cells of the A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells .
&quot; if an Anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( Gruppe 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with equal amounts of 5@@ - to 10 percent in@@ undation of A1 and A2 blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time necessary if the same tests are carried out with the same activity again dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted International standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group or with a standard preparation of equal activity . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( Gruppe 0 ) serum is mixed to an object carrier with a similar amount of 5@@ - to 10 percent in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time necessary if the same attempt is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group serum or a standard preparation of similar avi@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; if an Anti @-@ A + Anti @-@ B ( Gruppe 0 ) serum is mixed on an object carrier with the same amount of a 5 to 10 % flow of A@@ x ( A@@ y or A@@ o ) blood cells , the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within 5 minutes at a temperature of 18 to 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ R@@ h blood group sera of any specific@@ ity may belong to one of two species , which differ from the conditions under which an ag@@ glut@@ ination of hom@@ olo@@ l blood cells is reached . &quot;
&quot; with others referred to as &quot; in@@ completely , &quot; ag@@ glut@@ ination can only be achieved in the presence of certain col@@ lo@@ ids such as cow alb@@ um@@ in or by means of other special methods . &quot;
&quot; some &quot; &quot; incomplete &quot; &quot; ser@@ a ag@@ glut@@ inate on slides also hom@@ olog@@ ous red blood cells , which are sw@@ amped in their own serum or plasma . &quot;
the following requirements for the effectiveness of Ser@@ a for determining the R@@ h group may possibly change when International standard preparations are available ( i ) Anti @-@ D ( Anti @-@ Rh@@ o ) blood @-@ group serum ( human )
anti @-@ D serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen D of the R@@ h system .
&quot; it re@@ acts with human red blood cells containing the an@@ tigen D , but not with human red blood cells that do not contain the an@@ tigen . &quot;
complete &quot; Anti @-@ D Ser@@ a must have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 32 to C@@ c@@ De@@ e blood cells in a 0.@@ 9@@ % sal@@ ine solution .

the Tit@@ ans of the Anti @-@ C Ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; incomplete &quot; ) must be at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ d@@ dee blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ C Ser@@ a , which are intended for use on slides in accordance with the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and may not contain any form of Anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and the ag@@ glut@@ ination must be complete within 120 seconds . &quot;
anti @-@ E serum is obtained from the blood of one or more persons immun@@ ised by the an@@ tigen e of the R@@ h system .
anti @-@ E ser@@ a ( &quot; complete &quot; or &quot; in@@ complete &quot; ) should have a ti@@ ter of at least 1 : 8 compared to c@@ c@@ dd@@ E@@ e blood cells .
&quot; anti @-@ E ser@@ a , which are intended for use on slides in accordance with the Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son test ( and may not contain any form of Anti @-@ D ) , must have a visible ag@@ glut@@ ination within 30 seconds , and ag@@ glut@@ ination must be completed within 120 seconds . &quot;
sera of the specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ C and specific@@ ity Anti @-@ D + -@@ E can be obtained directly from the blood immun@@ ised persons or can be produced by mixing of anti @-@ D with anti @-@ C or anti @-@ E serum .
&quot; in a given serum , both antibodies must be effective at the same time under the reaction conditions specified by the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; if a serum for use on slides is determined according to the test according to Diamond and Ab@@ el@@ son , the ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation period in all types of red blood cells that show a reaction should not be less than with the proportion@@ ate antibodies . &quot;
anti @-@ A serum is obtained from the blood of animals that can be imm@@ uni@@ zed by blood cells or specific substances of group A .
&quot; anti @-@ A serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A2@@ B ; there is no human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ tigen , that is , those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ A serum is , parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group or a corresponding compar@@ ator , separated with in@@ undation of A1 , A2 and A2@@ B red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A serum is mixed on an object carrier with an equal amount of a 5 to 10 % in@@ undation of A@@ 1- , A@@ 2 and A2@@ B blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur in any in@@ undation within the double time required if the same attempt is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ A blood group or a standard preparation of similar avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ B serum is obtained from the blood of animals that can be immun@@ ised by red blood cells or specific substances of the blood group B .
&quot; anti @-@ B serum ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing B an@@ tigen , i.e. those of blood groups B and AB ; it ag@@ glut@@ inated no human red blood cells that contain no B @-@ tigen , that is those of blood groups 0 and A . &quot;
&quot; an anti @-@ B serum is , parallel to the re @-@ dissolved , but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group or a corresponding compar@@ ator , with an in@@ undation of blood cells of group B to ti@@ tr@@ ate ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ B serum is mixed on an object carrier with a similar amount of a 5 to 10 % in@@ undation of B @-@ blood cells , so the ag@@ glut@@ ination must occur within the double time required if the same attempt is carried out with the re @-@ dissolved but un@@ dil@@ uted international standard preparation of the Anti @-@ B blood group or with a standard preparation of equal avi@@ dity . &quot;
anti @-@ Human @-@ Glob@@ ulin @-@ Ser@@ um for the use in the blood group ser@@ ology has to contain glut@@ inous antibodies against Ig@@ G Glob@@ ulin and ag@@ glut@@ ination antibodies against complementary factors .
it is obtained from the blood of animals which are imm@@ uni@@ zed by injection of human serum samples .
&quot; it is used according to the manufacturer &apos;s prescription , so ag@@ glut@@ inated there are no un@@ loaded human red blood cells , regardless of which blood group they belong . &quot;

&quot; in the same or another on the label indicated di@@ lution it must also ag@@ glut@@ inate human red blood cells , which are sensi@@ ti@@ zed in the presence of fresh human serum with weak complementary anti @-@ Le@@ a antibodies . &quot;
&quot; for clinical use , the loading should be proven with all types of the above in@@ complete antibodies with a single di@@ lution of the anti @-@ human glob@@ ulin serum . &quot;
&quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent is obtained by extraction from the seed or other parts of a suitable plant and , if necessary , subsequent cleaning . &quot;
&quot; the Anti @-@ A Re@@ agent ag@@ glut@@ inated human red blood cells containing A @-@ anti@@ gens , i.e. those of blood groups A and AB including sub@@ groups A1 , A2 , A@@ 1@@ B and A2@@ B ; there is no human red blood cells that do not contain A @-@ tigen , that is , those of blood groups 0 and B . &quot;

&quot; based on article 5 ( 1 ) of the Convention that &quot; &quot; the Parties shall take all necessary measures &quot; &quot; to free the therapeutic substances provided by the other parties of human origin from all input charges ; &quot;
&quot; whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this liberation falls into the responsibility of the Community , which has been founded upon the Treaty by which it has been established ; &quot;
&quot; from this point on , a state cannot become a contracting party of the Convention , without becoming the contracting party of the Ad@@ ditional Protocol . &quot;

&quot; in THE assignment that the Community decided within the action program to strengthen the internal market , from 1 January 1988 to introduce a unified administration paper , &quot;
&quot; in the assignment that it is appropriate to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by the introduction of a unified administration paper , &quot;
&quot; in the opinion that this Convention shall not be interpreted in detail , that it exclu@@ des the contractual parties from their obligations arising from other international agreements ; &quot;
&quot; in this agreement , measures are set to simplify the transfer of goods between the Community and the EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries ; in particular , a uniform administration paper ( herein@@ after called single paper ) is to be used for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipment process ( herein@@ after referred to as the shipping method ) in goods transactions between the parties . &quot;
the goods related to the goods traffic between the contracting parties shall be authorised by means of a single document to use the pre @-@ print for the samples in An@@ nex I to this Convention .
&quot; the uniform paper is used as a registration or paper for export , dispatch or import . &quot;
&quot; - in order to carry out the legal regulations in force in a contracting party , whose application would not be warran@@ ted in the sole use of the uni@@ formity api@@ ary ; &quot;
&quot; - to be demanded by those involved , so that they can come upon request in the enjoyment of a part or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Convention does not hin@@ der the Parties to apply simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , in view of further facil@@ itation for the parties involved . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The simplified procedure may , in particular , fores@@ ee that the goods concerned shall not be placed at a customs office and the registration for these goods shall not be submitted to the customs office ; furthermore , the submission of an incomplete registration may be allowed . &quot;
&quot; in such cases , an application must be filed subsequently , with the consent of the competent authorities to conduct periodi@@ c anth@@ ology within the deadline stated by these authorities . &quot;

&quot; ( 2 ) In dero@@ g@@ atory provisions of paragraph 1 , the registration must always be made in one of the official languages of the import land , if they are registered in this country by other than that of the customs office of the export or departure country . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) The applicant or his representative may apply for each individual procedure of a consi@@ stance between the contractual parties , which may only be used for the application of the for@@ ti@@ fications in this one section , to which necessary copies can be attached to the support of the form@@ alities in one of the following sections . &quot;
( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 shall not be linked to a special condition of the competent authorities .
&quot; however , without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collective deliveries , the competent authorities may fores@@ ee that the for@@ ti@@ fications for export and dispatch procedures can be authorised to one and the same pre @-@ print by means of the specimens fores@@ een for these for@@ ti@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; in the cases of Article 7 , the competent authorities shall be able to agree , as far as possible , that the details contained in the copies of the application submitted in the individual procedure sections agree . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To ensure a smooth supply of goods between the parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or infrin@@ gements , customs authorities in these countries are looking for or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) The administrative assistance may be refused or rejected in whole or in part , if the requested country considers his security that the public order ( &quot; or@@ dre public &quot; ) or other essential interests may affect or violate any operating , business or professional sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) In the case of refusal or rejection of the administrative assistance , the appropriate decision and its grounds for the seeking country shall be un@@ allocated . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the customs authority of a country is seeking administrative assistance , which it could not afford , if it were sought , it points out in its request for this circum@@ stance . &quot;
&quot; ( 5 ) The information obtained pursuant to paragraph 1 shall only be used for the purposes of this Convention , and shall enjoy the protection granted to the national law of the country which it has received for information of this kind . &quot;
&quot; these information may only be used in any other way , with the written consent of the customs authority issued by the customs authority . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) A Mi@@ xed Committee shall be used , in which any Party of the Party shall represent this Convention . &quot;

&quot; ( 3 ) The Committee shall appro@@ ve amendments to the annex@@ es to this Convention , as well as the facil@@ itation referred to in Article 4 paragraph 3 of the last line of thought . &quot;
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party has accepted a decision under the provis@@ o of the asser@@ tion of the constitutional requirements , the decision shall enter into force on the first day of the second month following notification of the cancellation of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; each contracting party meets appropriate measures to ensure an effective and well @-@ balanced implementation of the Convention , whereby the need to be taken into account is to reduce the risk of goods loading as far as possible and to supply the difficulties arising from the application of the provisions of this Convention . &quot;

protocol to the 1979 Convention on a large @-@ scale air pollution control regarding the control of emissions from nitrogen oxi@@ des or its gr@@ en@@ ish @-@ ri@@ ver@@ ed river
&quot; concerned that the current emissions of air @-@ contam@@ in@@ ating substances in exposed parts of Europe and North America cause damage to natural treasures of vital importance for the environment and economy , &quot;
&quot; remember that the executive body recognised the need to effectively reduce annual total emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des from local and mo@@ ve@@ able sources or their gr@@ en@@ fe@@ ver@@ ish flow until 1995 , as well as the need for states that have already made progress in reducing these emissions , and verify their emission limits for nitrogen oxi@@ des . &quot;
&quot; taking into account existing scientific and technical data on emissions , air movements and impacts of nitrogen oxi@@ des and their follow @-@ on products on the environment as well as data on technologies to combat emissions , &quot;
&quot; determined to take effective measures to combat and reduce the annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des or their gr@@ en@@ fe@@ eb@@ ri@@ fied flow , especially by applying suitable national emission limits for new mobile larger local sources and by retro@@ fitting existing larger local sources , &quot;
&quot; in the realization that scientific and technical knowledge develops on these questions and that this development is to be taken into account in the review of the application of this protocol and in deciding on further measures , &quot;
&quot; recognizing that the formulation of a solution based on critical loads has the aim of creating an effective scientific foundation , which must be taken into account in the review of the application of this protocol and in deciding on further internationally agreed measures , &quot;
&quot; recognizing that the spe@@ edy review of procedures to create more favorable conditions for a technology exchange will contribute to an effective reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des in the Commission &apos;s region , &quot;
&quot; taking note of satisfaction that several states have committed one another to dispro@@ portion@@ ately reduce their annual national emissions of nitrogen oxi@@ des , and to considerable extent , &quot;
&quot; the measures already taken by some states have led to a reduction in emissions from nitrogen oxi@@ des , &quot;
