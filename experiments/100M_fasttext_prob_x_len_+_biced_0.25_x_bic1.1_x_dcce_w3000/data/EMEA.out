&quot; this document is a summary of the European Public De@@ dic@@ ation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) evaluated the studies conducted to make recommendations on the application of the drug . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg , 10 mg , 15 mg , and 30 mg tablets , 10 mg , 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , as a solution to intake ( 1 mg / ml ) and as an injection solution ( 7.5 mg / ml ) . &quot;
&quot; B. Cre@@ ating thinking and speaking , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations ( hearing or seeing things that are not present ) , di@@ str@@ ust and del@@ usion ; • Bi@@ polar I disorder , a mental illness in which the patients have man@@ ic episodes ( periods of abnormal high @-@ tuning ) alternating with periods of normal tuning . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is used to treat moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes and to prevent man@@ ic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past .
the injection solution is used for quick control of increased rest@@ lessness or behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances when the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible .
&quot; in both diseases , the solution to inhal@@ e or the melting tablets can be used in patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing tablets . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use other medicines at the same time , the same as Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted , the dose of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be adjusted . &quot;
&quot; this im@@ pairs the signal transmission between brain cells by &quot; neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters , &quot; i.e. , chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other . &quot;
Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole is believed to be a &quot; partial ag@@ ony &quot; for the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ sm@@ itter dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( also called ser@@ oton@@ in ) .
&quot; this means that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole acts like 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin and dop@@ amine , but less than the neur@@ ot@@ ran@@ smit@@ ters to activate the recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; as dop@@ amine and 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin play a role in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l contributes to norm@@ alize the activity of the brain , thus preventing psych@@ otic or man@@ ic symptoms and preventing their recur@@ rence . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy to prevent re@@ occurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year .
&quot; the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 80@@ 5 patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or similar diseases , which were suffering from increased un@@ rest , over a period of two hours compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in another study , Abi@@ li@@ fy was compared over twelve weeks to 3@@ 47 patients with hal@@ operi@@ dol , in another study the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy and placebo , which had been stabili@@ zed to 160 patients in which the man@@ ic symptoms were already stabili@@ zed with Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution was compared in a study to 30@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder which suffered from increased un@@ rest with the treatment of Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( another anti@@ psych@@ otic medicine ) and placebo over a period of two hours .
all studies examined the change in patients &quot; symptoms based on a standard scale for bi@@ polar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment .
the company also conducted studies to examine how the body absor@@ bs the melting tablets and the solution to inhal@@ ing ( absor@@ bs ) .
&quot; in both studies with the injection solution , patients who received Abi@@ li@@ fy in doses of 5.@@ 25 mg , 9.@@ 75 mg , or 15 mg , significantly reduced the symptoms of increased un@@ rest than the patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of bi@@ polar disorder , Abi@@ li@@ fy decreased in four of the five short @-@ term studies of man@@ ic symptoms more effective than placebo . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy also prevented up to 74 weeks longer than placebo to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in previously untreated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment .
Abi@@ li@@ fy inj@@ ections in 10@@ - or 15 mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo . symptoms increased rest@@ lessness and were similarly effective as Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am .
&quot; the most common side effects of Abi@@ li@@ fy for taking ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are extra@@ py@@ ra@@ mid@@ al disorders ( un@@ controlled ) , trem@@ ors , som@@ n@@ ol@@ ence ( nausea ) , vom@@ iting , nausea , nausea , rest@@ lessness , in@@ som@@ nia ( sleep disorders ) and anxiety . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and from moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , as well as in the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who spoke predominantly man@@ ic episodes and in which the man@@ ic episodes responded to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , out@@ weighed the risks . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased rest@@ lessness and behavi@@ our@@ al disturbances in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , if oral therapy is not suitable , out@@ weighs the risks . &quot;
&quot; in June 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Ot@@ su@@ ka Pharmaceu@@ tical Europe Ltd . approval for the use of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar disorder and for the prevention of a new man@@ ic episode in patients who had predominantly man@@ ic episodes and their man@@ ic episodes related to the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( see section 5.1 ) .
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
&quot; increased effectiveness in dos@@ ages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven , although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the efficacy of Abi@@ li@@ fy in the treatment of schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven .
&quot; with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients , a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 induc@@ tor is removed from the combination therapy , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l dose should be reduced to the recommended dose ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic medication , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
results of an epide@@ mi@@ ological study showed that in patients with bi@@ polar disorder there was no elevated risk of suicide associated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l compared to other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; if symptoms and symptoms of late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia , treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy , should be considered , reduce the dose or break the treatment . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a m@@ n , or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of m@@ ns , all anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , including Abi@@ li@@ fy , must be removed . &quot;
&quot; therefore , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l should be used with caution in patients with sei@@ zur@@ es in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis or in conditions associated with var@@ ic@@ ose attacks . &quot;
&quot; 56 - 99 years ) with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in patients with Alzheimer &apos;s disease , patients who were treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; however , there were in one of these trials , a study with a fixed dose , a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to un@@ desirable cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia , in some cases extremely and associated with k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis or hyper@@ os@@ mol@@ ar coma or death , was reported in patients treated with at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs , including Abi@@ li@@ fy . &quot;
there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ry , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known as side effects , or an un@@ healthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; due to the primary action of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l on the central nervous system , caution is advised if Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with over@@ lying side effects such as se@@ dation ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically non @-@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;
&quot; other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , like flu@@ ox@@ et@@ ine and par@@ ox@@ et@@ ine , have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in comparison to C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 exten@@ sive metabol@@ ites . &quot;
&quot; considering the joint administration of K@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or other highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors with Abi@@ li@@ fy , potential benefits should be out@@ weighed for the patient . &quot;
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
&quot; after applying the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose at the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em or esc@@ ital@@ op@@ ram or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 together with Abi@@ li@@ fy can be expected with a moderate increase in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - concentrations .
&quot; in clinical trials , doses of 10 @-@ 30 mg Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l showed no significant effect on the metabol@@ ites of the medi@@ ums of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ orph@@ an / 3 @-@ metho@@ xy@@ morph@@ ine ratio ) , 2@@ C@@ 19 ( O@@ me@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ) and 3@@ A4 ( D@@ ex@@ tro@@ meth@@ or@@ ph ) . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
&quot; due to the insufficient data base for human safety and due to the concerns raised in the reproduction studies in the animal , this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justi@@ fies the potential risk for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , patients should be warned against use dangerous machinery , including motor vehicles , until they are sure that Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has no negative influence on them . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) :
&quot; the frequency of the side effects below is defined according to the following criteria : frequent ( &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; schiz@@ ophren@@ ia - in a controlled long @-@ term study of 52 weeks , a total of lower incidence ( 25.@@ 8 % ) of EPS including Park@@ in@@ son@@ ism , Ak@@ ath@@ isie , D@@ yst@@ onia and Dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurred in patients treated with hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 5@@ 7.@@ 3 % ) . &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and 13.@@ 1 % in placebo .
in another controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS 14.@@ 8 % in patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was 15.@@ 1 % in patients under O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine therapy .
&quot; man@@ ic episodes in bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder - in a controlled study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 23.@@ 5 % in patients under Ari@@ i@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 5@@ 3.3 % in patients under hem@@ i@@ dol treatment . &quot;
&quot; in another study over 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term recovery phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ i@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 15.@@ 7 % for placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely monitored laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine @-@ phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their incidence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials and since the market launch , un@@ inten@@ tional or deliber@@ ate acute over@@ dos@@ ages with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 12@@ 60 mg and without death . &quot;
&quot; although there is no information on the efficacy of a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis in the treatment of an over@@ dose with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , it is unlikely that hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis is beneficial in the treatment of an over@@ dose as Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l has a high plasma @-@ rotation attachment . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by combining a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed in vitro a high aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and D@@ 3 receptor , as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 2a receptor as well as a moderate aff@@ inity to the dop@@ amine D@@ 4@@ - and 5@@ HT@@ 7@@ - , alpha @-@ 1 @-@ adren@@ ergi@@ c and hist@@ amine @-@ H@@ 1@@ receptor . &quot;
&quot; the posit@@ ron emission tom@@ ography showed a dose @-@ dependent reduction in binding of 11@@ C @-@ Rac@@ lo@@ pri@@ d , D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , D2 / D@@ 3 receptor lig@@ ands , on the cau@@ dat@@ us and the put@@ name . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents responded to the study medication in week 52 ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % and hal@@ operi@@ dol 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measured scales , defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg@@ - depression rates , showed a significantly stronger recovery than in hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed a significantly higher return rate that was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of approximately ) . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior effectiveness versus placebo in reducing man@@ ic symptoms over 3 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo and active controlled mon@@ otherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar I disorder , with or without psych@@ otic characteristics , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a preservation effect comparable to that of lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptom@@ atic re@@ mission of the man@@ ia , such as lithium or hal@@ operi@@ dol , in week 12 . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in some 2 weeks do not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; 10 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , for prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; based on in vitro studies , the enzyme C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 are responsible for de@@ hydr@@ ation and hydro@@ xy@@ ation of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the N @-@ De@@ al@@ k@@ yl@@ ation is cataly@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 . &quot;
&quot; the average Eli@@ min@@ ation@@ sh@@ al time is approximately 75 hours for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in extensive metabol@@ isi@@ on@@ ers via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , and approximately 146 hours at &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism users via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
&quot; in Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , there are no differences in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics between male and female healthy volunteers , and schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients showed no gender @-@ dependent effects . &quot;
a Pop@@ ular @-@ specific evaluation of pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics did not reveal any clin@@ ically significant differences with respect to the eth@@ ni@@ city or the effect of smoking on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole were similar in patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency compared to young healthy volunteers .
&quot; a single dose study in subjects with different liver cir@@ rho@@ sis ( Child @-@ Pu@@ gh Class A , B and C ) did not show a significant effect on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and Deh@@ ydr@@ o @-@ Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , but the study included only 3 patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of class C , which is not sufficient to draw conclusions to their metabolic capacities . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans , so they have limited or no importance for clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ se toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the average maximum dose in humans ) and an increase in secondary @-@ kidney @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose in humans ) .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( which is 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose of humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , the concentrations of the sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gate of hydro@@ xy@@ - Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l found at the highest recommended daily dose of 30 mg were not more than 6 % of the concentrations found in the study for 39 weeks in the genes of monkeys , and are far below the limit values ( 6 % ) of in vitro sol@@ ubil@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the middle @-@ state @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; perfor@@ ated bli@@ ster packs for placing single doses of aluminium in folding cart@@ ons with 14 x 1 , 28 x 1 , 49 x 1 , 56 x 1 , 98 x 1 tablets . &quot;
&quot; 15 L@@ ate dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by combining a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; 22 In a placebo @-@ controlled study over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , for prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; 27 late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia occurring during the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;

&quot; 46 In a placebo @-@ controlled trial over 26 weeks followed by a long @-@ term expansion phase over 74 weeks in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , for prevention of a bi@@ polar return , mainly in the prevention of a return to the man@@ ia . &quot;
the recommended starting dose for Ari@@ i@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals .
patients who have difficulty swal@@ lowing Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets can take the tablets as an alternative to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets ( see Section 5.2 ) .
&quot; the occurrence of su@@ ici@@ dal behavior belongs to psych@@ otic diseases and aff@@ ective disorder was reported in some cases at the beginning or after change of an anti@@ psych@@ otic treatment , also in treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ n are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia as a result of com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or pregnant during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l
the following adverse events were more common ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects of the drug ( * ) :

the recommended starting dose for Abi@@ li@@ fy is 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as mon@@ otherapy or combination therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in order to prevent the recur@@ rence of man@@ ic episodes in patients who have already received Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , the therapy should be continued with the same dose . &quot;

there are no precise risk assessments for hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia related adverse events in patients treated with Abi@@ li@@ fy and other at@@ yp@@ ical anti@@ psych@@ otic drugs to allow direct compar@@ isons .
&quot; 92 In a clinical trial with healthy volunteers , a highly effective C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or ( Ch@@ ini@@ dine ) increased the AU@@ C of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l by 107 % while the C@@ MA@@ x remained unchanged . &quot;

it is thought that the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder is medi@@ ated by combining a partial agon@@ istic effect on dop@@ amine D@@ 2- and ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 1 recept@@ ors and an antagon@@ istic effect on ser@@ oton@@ in 5@@ HT@@ 2a recept@@ ors .
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine @-@ controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of approximately ) . &quot;
&quot; 97 In a placebo @-@ controlled mon@@ otherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a relative bio availability study , in which the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of 30 mg Ari@@ i@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l was compared with 30 mg of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in healthy subjects , the ratio between the geomet@@ rical C@@ MA@@ x mean value of the solution and the value of the tablets at 122 % ( N = 30 ) . &quot;
&quot; 99 Fur@@ ther@@ more , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of monkeys after repeated oral dosage of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) in the recommended clinical dose or from 16@@ - to 8@@ 1@@ times of the recommended maximum dose . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages , which led to ex@@ positions of the 3 and 11 @-@ fold of the middle @-@ state @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;
Abi@@ li@@ fy injection solution is used for fast control of acute and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders in patients with schiz@@ ophren@@ ia or in patients with man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder if oral therapy is not appropriate .
&quot; as soon as it is clin@@ ically appropriate , the treatment should be terminated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution and started with the oral application of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; to increase absorption and to minim@@ ise vari@@ ability , injection into the M. del@@ to@@ ide@@ us or deep into the glut@@ eus maxim@@ us muscle is recommended under wra@@ ps of adi@@ p@@ ous regions . &quot;
a lower dose of 5.@@ 25 mg ( 0.@@ 7 ml ) can be given depending on the individual clinical status taking into account the medicines used for maintenance or acute therapy ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; if a secondary oral treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l is indicated , see the summary of the characteristics of the medicine to Abi@@ li@@ fy tablets , Abi@@ li@@ fy Mel@@ ting tablets or Abi@@ li@@ fy solution . &quot;
&quot; there are no studies on the efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution in patients with a@@ gi@@ bility and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , which were caused differently from schiz@@ ophren@@ ia and man@@ ic episodes of bi@@ polar @-@ I disorder . &quot;
&quot; if par@@ enter@@ al therapy with ben@@ zo@@ di@@ az@@ ep@@ ines is considered necessary in addition to the Ari@@ i@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution , patients should be observed in terms of extreme se@@ dation or blood pressure drop ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
investigations on the safety and efficacy of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution are not available for patients with alcohol or drug pois@@ oning ( by prescribed or illegal medicines ) .
&quot; Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or isch@@ em@@ ic heart disease , heart failure , over@@ flow disturbances ) , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular diseases , conditions that are pre@@ dispos@@ ed for hyp@@ ot@@ onia ( de@@ hydr@@ ation , hypo@@ vol@@ emia , treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs ) or hyper@@ tension ( including acute and mal@@ ig@@ ne form ) . &quot;
&quot; late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia : in clinical trials , which lasted one year or less , there were occasional reports of dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia during treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l . &quot;
&quot; clinical manifestations of a m@@ n are high fever , stiff@@ ness , changing levels of consciousness and signs of autonomous inst@@ ability ( irregular pulse or blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , swe@@ ating and heart rhythm disorders ) . &quot;
&quot; poly@@ di@@ p@@ sia , poly@@ ur@@ ry , pol@@ yp@@ ha@@ gy and weakness ) are observed and patients with diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or with risk factors for diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; weight gain is generally observed in schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients and patients with bi@@ polar man@@ ia due to com@@ or@@ bi@@ di@@ ties , the use of anti@@ psych@@ ot@@ ics , in which weight gain is known or an un@@ healthy li@@ fest@@ yles and could lead to serious complications . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared with the after sole administration of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l , in a study in which healthy volunteers Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( 15 mg dose ) was used as one @-@ time intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly and simultaneously received lau@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) intra@@ muscular . &quot;
&quot; the H@@ 2 antagon@@ ist Fam@@ oti@@ din , a ga@@ stri@@ c acid blo@@ cker , reduces the absorption rate of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , but this effect is considered clin@@ ically non @-@ relevant . &quot;
&quot; in C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 &apos; bad &apos; ( = &quot; poor &quot; ) metabolism , the common application with highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in comparison with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 . &quot;
other highly effective inhibit@@ ors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 such as I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and HI@@ V@@ - prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made .
&quot; after applying the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6@@ - or 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , the dosage of Abi@@ li@@ fy should be lifted to the dose at the beginning of the accompanying therapy . &quot;
&quot; 106 Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am ( 2 mg dose ) was intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly received , the intensity of the se@@ dation was greater compared to that after the sole gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
the following adverse events occurred more often in clinical studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) ( see section 5.1 ) :
&quot; the frequency of adverse events listed below is defined according to the following criteria : often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; 107 The following adverse events occurred more often ( ≥ 1 / 100 ) than placebo , or were classified as possible medi@@ cally relevant side effects ( * ) in clinical studies ( see section 5.1 ) : &quot;
in a placebo @-@ controlled long @-@ term study over 26 weeks the incidence of EPS was 19 % in patients under Ari@@ i@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 13.@@ 1 % in patients under placebo .
&quot; in another study of 12 weeks , the incidence of EPS 26@@ ,@@ 6 % in patients under Ari@@ i@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - treatment and 17.@@ 6 % for those under lithium @-@ treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the long @-@ term recovery phase over 26 weeks in a placebo @-@ controlled study , the incidence of EPS 18,@@ 2 % for patients under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was 15.@@ 7 % for placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
a comparison between the patient groups under Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l and placebo in which potentially clin@@ ically significant changes in rout@@ inely monitored laboratory parameters did not result in medi@@ cally significant differences .
&quot; increases in CP@@ K ( cre@@ atine phosph@@ ate kin@@ ase ) , generally temporary and asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic , were observed in 3.5 % of patients treated with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l , compared to 2.0 % of patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; side effects reported in connection with an anti@@ psych@@ otic therapy and their incidence in the treatment with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l include malign@@ ant neuro@@ le@@ p@@ tic syndrome , late dy@@ sk@@ in@@ esia and var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , unwanted cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients , hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
110 and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders were the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution associated with statisti@@ cally significant greater improvements of ag@@ gi@@ bility / behavi@@ our@@ al dysfunction compared to placebo and was similar to hal@@ operi@@ dol .
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term study ( 24 h ) with 29@@ 1 patients with bi@@ polar disorder as well as det@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and behavi@@ our@@ al disorders , the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l injection solution was associated with a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the symptoms regarding det@@ ect@@ ability and behavi@@ our@@ al dysfunction compared to placebo and similar to the Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am@@ - reference poor . &quot;
&quot; the average improvement observed from bas@@ eline on the P@@ AN@@ SS Ex@@ cit@@ ement Compon@@ ent score was 5.@@ 8 for placebo , 9,@@ 6 for Lor@@ az@@ ep@@ am and 8,@@ 7 for Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l . &quot;
&quot; in analyses of sub@@ groups in patients with mixed episodes or patients with severe a@@ gi@@ bility , a similar efficacy was observed with regard to the overall population , but a statistical significance could be determined based on a reduced patient number . &quot;
&quot; in three placebo @-@ controlled short @-@ term studies ( 4 to 6 weeks ) to 1,@@ 2@@ 28 schiz@@ ophren@@ ic patients with positive or negative symptoms , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the psych@@ otic symptoms compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a hal@@ operi@@ dol @-@ controlled study , 52 percent of respon@@ dents responded to the study medication in week 52 ( Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l 77 % ( oral ) and hal@@ operi@@ dol ( 73 % ) . &quot;
&quot; current values of measured scales , defined as secondary study goals , including P@@ AN@@ SS and Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ As@@ berg @-@ depression rates , showed a significantly stronger recovery than in hal@@ operi@@ dol . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks of stabili@@ zed patients with chronic schiz@@ ophren@@ ia , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) showed a significantly higher return rate , which was 34 % in the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ ol@@ - ( oral ) group and 57 % below placebo . &quot;
&quot; in an O@@ lan@@ zap@@ ine controlled , multi @-@ blind study in schiz@@ ophren@@ ia over 26 weeks , the 3@@ 14 patients included a weight gain of at least 7 % compared to bas@@ eline ( i.e. an increase of at least 5.@@ 6 kg with an average weight of ca . 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; 111 in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a man@@ ic or mixed episode of a bi@@ polar @-@ I @-@ disorder , with or without psych@@ otic features , which in some 2 weeks do not respond to lithium or val@@ pro@@ at mon@@ otherapy with therapeutic serum levels , the adju@@ v@@ ant therapy with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l revealed superior efficacy in reducing man@@ ic symptoms compared to mon@@ otherapy with lithium or val@@ pro@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 26 weeks followed by a 74 @-@ week study in man@@ ic patients who had reached a re@@ mission with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l during a stabili@@ zation phase , Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l was considering the prevention of a revers@@ al in the man@@ ia . &quot;
the Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l AU@@ C is 90 % larger in the first 2 hours after intra@@ muscular injection of the same dose as a tablet ; systemic exposure was similar between the two form@@ ulations .
&quot; in 2 studies with healthy volunteers , the mean time needed to achieve the maximum plasma level was 1 to 3 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; the gift of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l injection solution was well tolerated by rats and monkeys and did not result in any direct toxic@@ ity of a target organ after repeated use in systemic exposure ( AU@@ C ) , which were 15@@ - and 5 times above the maximum human therapeutic exposure of 30 mg intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly . &quot;
&quot; in studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity after intraven@@ ous application , there were no safety @-@ relevant concerns about mat@@ ernal exposure , which was 15@@ - ( rats ) and 29 @-@ mal ( rab@@ bits ) over the maximum humane therapeutic exposure of 30 mg . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies with Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ z@@ l ( oral ) for safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , reproductive toxic@@ ity , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , and carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential , prec@@ lin@@ ical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; toxic@@ ologically significant effects were only observed in dos@@ ages or ex@@ positions , which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans ; therefore , they have limited or no importance for clinical application . &quot;
the effects included a dose @-@ dependent adren@@ al rin@@ se toxic@@ ity ( li@@ po@@ f@@ us@@ cin pigment accumulation and / or par@@ ench@@ y@@ mal loss ) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day ( equivalent to the 3 to 10 times the average steady @-@ state exposure ( AU@@ C ) at the recommended maximum dose of humans .
&quot; in addition , chol@@ eli@@ thi@@ asis was detected as a result of the precip@@ itation of sulph@@ ate @-@ con@@ ju@@ gates of the hydro@@ xy@@ - metabol@@ ites of Ari@@ pi@@ pra@@ zo@@ l in the G@@ alle of apes following repeated oral dose of 25 to 125 mg / kg / day ( 1 to 3 times the recommended maximum dose for humans based on mg / m2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in rab@@ bits , these effects were observed after dos@@ ages leading to ex@@ positions of the 3- and 11 @-@ fold of the mean steady @-@ state AU@@ C at the recommended clinical maximum dose . &quot;

&quot; the efficacy of Abra@@ x@@ ane was studied in a major study where 4@@ 60 women with metastatic breast cancer participated , some of whom had received an anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine . &quot;
the effect of Abra@@ x@@ ane ( in sole administration or as mon@@ otherapy ) was compared with the medication containing a conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel ( given in combination with other medicines to reduce side effects ) .
&quot; in total , in the main study 72 ( 31 % ) of the 2@@ 29 patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane responded to the treatment , compared to 37 ( 16 % ) of the 225 patients who received conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
only those patients who were treated for metastatic breast cancer in terms of efficacy indicators such as time to the deterioration of the disease and survival did not make any difference between the drugs .
&quot; in contrast , in patients who had previously received other treatments for their metastatic breast cancer , these indicators showed that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , it may not be used in patients who have low neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils in the blood or before the treatment . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) noted that Abra@@ x@@ ane was more effective in patients in which the first treatment was no longer effective than conventional pac@@ lit@@ axel had to be given with other medicines to reduce side effects .
&quot; in January 2008 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Abra@@ xis Bio@@ Science Limited a permit for the transport of Abra@@ x@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
Abra@@ x@@ ane @-@ Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment of metastatic breast cancer in patients where the first @-@ line treatment for metastatic disease has failed and for which a standard anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine @-@ containing therapy is not indicated ( see also section 4.4 ) .
in patients with severe neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ p of &lt; 0.@@ 50 x 109 / l over a period of one week or longer ) or severe sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy during the Abra@@ x@@ ane therapy the dose should be reduced to 220 mg / m2 in subsequent series .
&quot; in sensory neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 , the treatment should be interrupted until an improvement is achieved to Grade 1 or 2 , and the dose must be reduced in all subsequent cycles . &quot;
there is currently no adequate data for the recommendation of dose @-@ adap@@ tations in patients with mild to moderate impair@@ ment of the liver function ( see section 4.@@ 4. and 5.2 ) .
no studies with patients with impaired ren@@ al function were conducted and there are currently no adequate data on the recommendation of dose @-@ adap@@ tations in patients with kidney function impair@@ ment ( see Section 5.2 ) .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is not recommended for use in children under 18 years due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
Abra@@ x@@ ane is an alb@@ um@@ in @-@ bound nan@@ op@@ arti@@ cular formulation of Pac@@ lit@@ axel which could exhibit significantly other pharmac@@ ological characteristics than other form@@ ulations of pac@@ lit@@ axel ( see Section 5.1 and 5.2 ) .
&quot; if an allergic reaction occurs , the medicine should be immediately dismissed and a symptom@@ atic treatment should be initiated and the patient must not be treated again with pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
patients should not restart Abra@@ x@@ ane treatment cycles until the number of neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils has increased again &gt; 1.5 x 109 / l and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number has increased again &gt; 100 x 109 / l .
patients with severe liver dysfunction ( bili@@ ru@@ bin &gt; 5 x UL@@ N or AS@@ L / AL@@ T &gt; 10 x UL@@ N ) should not be treated with Abra@@ x@@ anes .
&quot; while a clearly demonstrated cardi@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity associated with Abra@@ x@@ ane is not proven , cardiac occur@@ ren@@ ces in the indigenous populations are not unusual , especially in patients with earlier anth@@ ra@@ cycl@@ ine treatment or underlying heart or lung disease . &quot;
&quot; if there are nausea , vom@@ iting and diar@@ rho@@ ea in patients after the treatment of Abra@@ x@@ ane , they can be treated with the usual anti@@ em@@ etic and con@@ sti@@ pation . &quot;
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane should not be used in pregnant women or for women in child@@ bearing age , who do not practice effective contrac@@ eption , unless the treatment of the mother with pac@@ lit@@ axel is unavoid@@ able . &quot;
women in child@@ bearing age should use a reliable contrac@@ eption method during and up to 1 month after the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane .
&quot; male patients , who are treated with Abra@@ x@@ anes , are advised to witness no child during and up to six months after the treatment . &quot;
male patients should be advised of a sperm conservation before treatment as the treatment with Abra@@ x@@ ane is the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible in@@ fertility .
&quot; Abra@@ x@@ ane can cause side effects like ti@@ redness ( very common ) and di@@ zz@@ iness ( often ) , which can affect the traffic and ability to operate machinery . &quot;
the following are the most common and most important cases of side effects observed in 2@@ 29 patients with metastatic breast cancer treated in pi@@ vot@@ al clinical phase III study once every three weeks with 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane .
neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was the most prominent hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ( reported in 79 % of the patients ) and was quickly rever@@ sible and dose @-@ dependent ; leu@@ kop@@ en@@ ia was reported in 71 % of patients .
an@@ emia ( H@@ b &lt; 10 g / dl ) was observed in 46 % of patients treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane and was severe in three cases ( H@@ b &lt; 8 g / dl ) .
table 1 shows the side effects associated with the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane as mon@@ otherapy in every dose and indication in studies ( N = 7@@ 89 ) .
&quot; very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) ; very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) . &quot;
&quot; occasionally : increased blood pressure , weight gain , increased lac@@ tate hydro@@ gen@@ ase in the blood , increased cre@@ atine in the blood , increased blood sugar , increased phosphor@@ us in the blood , reduced potassium in the blood , heart disease : &quot;
&quot; dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , blo@@ ating , tongue @-@ burning , dry mouth , painful to@@ g@@ ums , loose stools , es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , pain in the abdom@@ en , oral pain , rec@@ tal bleeding disorders of the kidneys and ur@@ inary tract : &quot;
&quot; pain in the chest wall , weakness of mus@@ cul@@ ature , neck pain , pain in skel@@ etal muscles , flan@@ k pain , discomfort in the limbs , muscle weakness Very frequent : &quot;
rest@@ lessness 1 The frequency of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions is calculated based on a specific case in a population of 7@@ 89 patients
&quot; since these events were reported on a voluntary basis during clinical practice , no estimates of the actual frequency are possible and no caus@@ al connection was established with these events . &quot;
pac@@ lit@@ axel is an anti @-@ mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules substance that promotes the accumulation of mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules from the tu@@ b@@ ules and stabili@@ zes the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ules by inhibit@@ ing their poly@@ mer@@ isation .
this stabili@@ zation leads to an in@@ hibition of the normal dynamic re@@ organization of the mic@@ rot@@ ub@@ ul@@ ary network which is essential for the vital inter@@ phase and the mit@@ otic cell functions .
it is known that alb@@ um@@ in con@@ veys the trans@@ cyclo@@ pa@@ sis of plasma components into the end@@ othel@@ ial cells and in the frame of in @-@ vitro studies it has been proven that the presence of alb@@ um@@ in promotes the transport of pac@@ lit@@ axel with the end@@ othel@@ ial cells .
&quot; it is assumed that this improved trans @-@ end@@ othel@@ ial transport is medi@@ ated through the g@@ p @-@ 60 @-@ alb@@ umin@@ re@@ zep@@ tor , and due to the alb@@ umin@@ ous protein SP@@ ARC ( sec@@ ted protein aci@@ dic rich in c@@ yst@@ eine ) a pac@@ lit@@ axel accumulation appears in the area of the tumor . &quot;
the use of Abra@@ x@@ ane for metastatic breast cancer is supported by data from 106 patients in two single @-@ arm untreated studies and 4@@ 54 patients treated in a random@@ ised Phase III study .
&quot; in one study , 43 patients with metastatic breast cancer were treated with Abra@@ x@@ ane , which was given in the form of an in@@ fusion over 30 minutes with a dose of 175 mg / m2 . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , a dose of 300 mg / m2 was used as an in@@ fusion of 30 minutes to 63 patients with metastatic breast cancer . &quot;
&quot; this multi@@ center study was performed in patients with metastatic breast cancer , who received treatment with pac@@ lit@@ axel alone 3 weeks , either in the form of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel 175 mg / m2 , or in the form of an allergic reaction ( N = 225 ) or in the form of Abra@@ x@@ ane 260 mg / m2 as a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion without pre@@ medi@@ cation ( N = 2@@ 29 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study , 64 % of patients had a com@@ promised general condition ( ECO@@ G 1 or 2 ) , 79 % had vis@@ cer@@ al metast@@ ases and 76 % had more than 3 metast@@ ases . &quot;
&quot; 14 % of patients had not received chemotherapy before , 27 % had only one adju@@ v@@ ant chemotherapy , 40 % only because of metast@@ asis and 19 % due to metast@@ asis and adju@@ v@@ ant treatment . &quot;
9 The results for the general response rate and time to progression @-@ free survival and survival for patients receiving &gt; First @-@ Line therapy are presented below .
neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity compared to pac@@ lit@@ axel was evaluated by the improvement of a degree for patients who experienced peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy level 3 at a time during therapy .
the natural course of peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy for decay on bas@@ eline because of the cum@@ ulative toxic@@ ity of Abra@@ x@@ ane after &gt; 6 treatment courses has not been evaluated and is still unknown .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of the total @-@ pac@@ lit@@ axel after 30 and 180 @-@ minute in@@ fu@@ sions of Abra@@ x@@ ane with a dose of 80 to 3@@ 75 mg / m2 was determined in clinical studies .
&quot; drug exposure ( AU@@ C ) increased linear from 26@@ 53 to 16@@ 7@@ 36 n@@ g@@ .@@ h / ml , an@@ alog@@ ous to a dose of 80 to 300 mg / m2 . &quot;
10 Accor@@ ding to the intraven@@ ous dose of Abra@@ x@@ ane in patients with metastatic breast cancer in the recommended clinical dose of 260 mg / m2 the pac@@ lit@@ axel plasma concentration decreased in a multi@@ phase way .
the average distribution volume was 6@@ 32 l / m2 ; the high distribution volume points to a far @-@ reaching extra@@ vascular distribution and / or distribution of pac@@ lit@@ axel .
&quot; in a study with advanced solid tum@@ ors , the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of pac@@ lit@@ axel were compared with an intraven@@ ous 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 of Abra@@ x@@ ane with the values after a 3 @-@ hour injection of 175 mg / m2 of solvent @-@ containing pac@@ lit@@ axel . &quot;
&quot; the clearance of pac@@ lit@@ axel was higher ( 43 % ) after the Abra@@ x@@ ane administration , and the distribution volume was higher in Abra@@ x@@ ane ( 53 % ) . &quot;
in the published literature on in @-@ vitro studies of human liver micro@@ some and tissue layers is reported that pac@@ lit@@ axel is met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed primarily to 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and to two smaller metabol@@ ites ( 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ lit@@ axel and 6@@ α -@@ 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel ) .
&quot; after a 30 @-@ minute in@@ fusion of 260 mg / m2 in patients with metastatic breast cancer , the mean value for cum@@ ulative ur@@ inary ex@@ cre@@ tion was 4 % of the given total dose with less than 1 % of the metabol@@ ites 6@@ α -@@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel and 3 &quot; -@@ p @-@ hydro@@ x@@ yp@@ ac@@ lit@@ axel , which indicates a far @-@ reaching non @-@ ren@@ al clearance . &quot;
&quot; however , only a few data are available about patients at the age of over 75 , because only 3 patients of this age group participated in pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis . &quot;
the chemical and physical stability was detected at 2 ° C - 8 ° C in the original box and protected from light light over 8 hours .
Pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe may be inj@@ ected slowly over a period of at least 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane flow bottle .
&quot; after complete en@@ core of the solution , the flow bottle should rest at least 5 minutes to ensure good wet@@ ting of the solid . &quot;
&quot; then the flow bottle should be slowly and carefully and / or inver@@ ted for at least 2 minutes , until a complete res@@ us@@ pension of the powder is done . &quot;
&quot; if precip@@ itation or sin@@ king is visible , the pass @-@ through bottle must be inver@@ ted again gently , in order to achieve a complete recovery prior to the application . &quot;

&quot; if it is not used immediately , it can be stored in the flow bottle up to 8 hours in the refrigerator ( 2 ° C - 8 ° C ) if it is stored in the um@@ cart@@ on to protect the contents from light . &quot;
each bottle contains 100 mg Pac@@ lit@@ axel . • After the re@@ constitution every ml of the Sus@@ pension contains 5 mg Pac@@ lit@@ axel . • The other component is alb@@ umin@@ ous from humans ( contains sodium , sodium cap@@ r@@ yl@@ ate and N acet@@ yl@@ tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han ( Ph@@ .@@ Eur@@ . ) ) &quot;
precau@@ tions for the preparation and application of pac@@ lit@@ axel is a cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic anti@@ carcin@@ ogen@@ ic drug and as well as other potentially toxic substances should be observed when dealing with Abra@@ x@@ ane caution .
using a sterile sy@@ ringe should be inj@@ ected slowly over a period of 1 minute 20 ml of a 9 mg / ml ( 0.@@ 9 % ) sodium chlori@@ de in@@ fusion solution into a Abra@@ x@@ ane flow bottle .
&quot; after that , swing and / or in@@ vert the penetration bottle for at least 2 minutes and / or in@@ vert until a complete res@@ us@@ pension of the powder is done . &quot;
&quot; the exact total dose volume of the 5 mg / ml suspension is calculated for the patient and inj@@ ected the corresponding quantity of the re@@ constituted Abra@@ x@@ ane in an empty , sterile PVC in@@ fusion bag type IV . &quot;

&quot; member states must ensure that prior to market launch , the holder of the approval for the market launch will provide medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail outlets with the following information and materials : &quot;
&quot; • Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packing supplement . • With unique pic@@ torial representation of the correct application of the product , refriger@@ ated boxes for transport through the patients . &quot;
&quot; this means that ab@@ se@@ amed is similar to a biological drug , which is already approved in the European Union ( EU ) and contains the same active ingredient ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in patients with normal blood test values in which complications may occur in connection with a blood trans@@ fusion disorder , if a blood loss of 900 to 1,@@ 800 ml is expected before the procedure . &quot;
the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed must be initiated under the supervision of a physician who has experience in the treatment of patients with diseases for which the medicine is indicated .
&quot; in patients with kidney problems and in patients who want to make a blood donation , Ab@@ sen@@ amed is inj@@ ected into a vein . &quot;
the injection can also be carried out by the patient or his care@@ gi@@ vers provided they have received an appropriate guidance .
&quot; in patients with chronic ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency or in patients receiving chemotherapy , hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values should always lie in the recommended area ( between 10 and 12 grams per dec@@ il@@ iter in adults or between 9.5 and 11 g / dl in children ) . &quot;
&quot; the iron levels of all patients must be controlled before the treatment to ensure that there is no iron deficiency , and iron supplements should be administered throughout the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients receiving chemotherapy , or in patients with kidney problems , an@@ a@@ emia may be caused by an ery@@ thro@@ po@@ i@@ et@@ in@@ deficiency , or by the fact that the body does not adequately respond to the body &apos;s ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin is also used before surgery to increase the number of red blood cells and thereby reduce the consequences of a blood loss .
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling it to form epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; in the course of a study involving 4@@ 79 patients suffering from kidney problems , Ab@@ se@@ amed was compared with the reference drug . &quot;
all patients participating in this study had been inj@@ ected E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ r@@ yp@@ o for at least eight weeks before they were either converted to stre@@ amed or continued E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ cryp@@ o .
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values between the beginning of the study and the assessment period in the weeks 25 to 29 .
the company also presented the results of a study in which the effects of ab@@ se@@ amed under the skin were examined with those of E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ r@@ yp@@ o in 114 cancer patients receiving chemotherapy .
&quot; in the study of patients suffering from an@@ a@@ emia caused by kidney problems , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values were maintained to the same degree as in those patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ cryp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; in comparison , patients who continued to receive E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ r@@ yp@@ o showed an increase of 0.0@@ 63 g / dl of output value of 12.@@ 0 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent side effect of Ab@@ di@@ amed is an increase in blood pressure , which may occasionally lead to symptoms of en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain problems ) such as sudden , sm@@ elling mig@@ raine head@@ aches and confusion . &quot;
&quot; stre@@ amed may not be used in patients , which may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; stre@@ amed as an injection under the skin is not recommended for the treatment of kidney problems , as further studies are required to make sure that this does not trigger allergic reactions . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that for Ab@@ sec@@ stre@@ amed according to the provisions of the European Union , evidence has been provided that the medicine has a comparable quality , safety and efficacy profile such as E@@ pre@@ x / Er@@ cryp@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the company , which produces ab@@ se@@ amed , will provide information packages for medical specialists in all Member States , including information on the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in August 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Medi@@ ce Medic@@ ines P@@ üt@@ ter GmbH &amp; Co . kg for the marketing of ab@@ sent@@ stre@@ amed throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; treatment of an@@ a@@ emia and reduction of the trans@@ fusion needs in adults with solid tumours , malign@@ ant lymph@@ omas or multiple my@@ el@@ oma who receive chemotherapy and where the risk of trans@@ fusion is due to the general condition ( such as cardiovascular status , pre @-@ existing an@@ a@@ emia at the beginning of chemotherapy ) . &quot;
&quot; treatment should only be performed in patients with moderate an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in &#91; H@@ b &#93; 10 - 13 g / dl &#91; 6.2 - 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l &#93; , if blood @-@ saving measures are not available or inadequate , with planned larger operating procedures requiring a large volume of blood ( 4 or more blood for women ; 5 or more units blood in men ) . &quot;
&quot; for the reduction of foreign blood , Ab@@ el@@ amed may be applied in front of a large electro @-@ orthop@@ edic surgery in adults with no iron deficiency , in which a high risk of trans@@ fusion complications is to be expected . &quot;
&quot; H@@ B 10 @-@ 13 g / dl ) and an expected blood loss of 900 @-@ 1800 ml , which cannot take part in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program . &quot;
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration is between 10 and 12 g / dl ( 6.2 - 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) except for pedi@@ atric patients where the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration should lie between 9.5 and 11 g / dl ( 5.@@ 9 - 6.@@ 8 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex , and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
an increase in hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) over a period of four weeks should be avoided .
&quot; due to the vari@@ ability between patients , individual ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values can be observed above or below the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; in view of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value rises by more than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month or if the permanent ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value exceeds 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa dose is reduced by 25 % . &quot;
patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose required for the control of an@@ a@@ emia and an@@ emia .
the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6 g / dl or &lt; 3.@@ 75 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 8 g / dl or &gt; 5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; the present clinical results suggest that patients with initially low H@@ b value ( &lt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &lt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) may need higher maintenance doses than patients where initial an@@ a@@ emia is less severe ( H@@ b &gt; 6,@@ 8 g / dl or &gt; 4.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; starting dose : 50 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week using an intraven@@ ous application , if necessary with a dose increase of 25 I.@@ U. / kg ( three times a week ) until the desired target value is reached ( this should take place in incre@@ ments of at least 4 weeks ) . &quot;
&quot; symptoms and symptoms may vary depending on age , sex , and overall disease burden ; therefore , the assessment of the individual clinical course and condition of the disease is required by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in view of this ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in vari@@ ability , a corresponding dose management should be attempted to achieve hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 10 g / dl ( 6.2 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) up to 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be closely monitored to ensure that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is applied in the lowest approved dose , which is required for control of the sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by at least 1 g / dl ( 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the recur@@ rence rate of ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be maintained three times a week or 450 I.@@ U. / kg once a week . &quot;
&quot; if hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in has increased &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and the recur@@ rence rate of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , the dose should be increased to 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if after another 4 weeks of treatment with 300 I.@@ U. / kg three times a week of the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value of ≥ 1 g / dl ( ≥ 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the recur@@ rence rate of ≥ 40.000 cells / µ@@ l , the dose should be maintained three times a week . &quot;
&quot; if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value is increased by &lt; 1 g / dl ( &lt; 0,@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) or the recur@@ rence rate of &lt; 40,000 cells / µ@@ l compared to the initial value , a response to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy is unlikely and the treatment should be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; patients with mild an@@ a@@ emia ( hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit 33 - 39 % ) , in which the precau@@ tionary storage of ≥ 4 blood con@@ ges@@ tion is required , ab@@ sent@@ stre@@ amed should be received twice a week for 3 weeks prior to surgery . &quot;
iron sub@@ stitution should begin as early as possible - e.g. a few weeks before the onset of the aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program - that large iron reserves are available before the beginning of the stre@@ amed therapy .
&quot; 6 The recommended dosage is 600 I.@@ U. / kg of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , which should be given once a week over three weeks ( day 21 , 14 and 7 ) before surgery and on the day of surgery ( Day 0 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this case epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa should be pre@@ oper@@ atively pre@@ oper@@ atively 300 I.@@ U. / kg to 10 consecutive days , on the day of the surgery and 4 days immediately thereafter . &quot;
&quot; alternatively , the injection at the end of the di@@ aly@@ sis can be given via the hose of a fi@@ st@@ ula , followed by 10 ml is@@ ot@@ onic sal@@ ine solution to rin@@ se the hose and ensure a sufficient injection of the medicine into the circulation . &quot;
&quot; patients suffering from a ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( Pure Red Cell A@@ pla@@ sia , PR@@ CA ) under the treatment of any ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( see paragraph 4.4 - ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ) . &quot;
&quot; heart attack or stroke within one month prior to treatment , unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , increased risk of deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ( e.g. an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bo@@ lia ) . &quot;
&quot; the use of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is contra@@ indicated in patients who are not able to participate in an aut@@ olog@@ ous blood donation program : severe cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease , peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion , vascular disease of the carot@@ id or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ; in patients with a recently beaten heart attack or cereb@@ rov@@ ascular accident . &quot;
ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a ( PR@@ CA ) Very rare was reported about the appearance of an anti @-@ body medi@@ ated PR@@ CA after months of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin .
&quot; in patients with sudden loss of action , defined as a reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( 1 - 2 g / dl per month ) with increased need for trans@@ fu@@ sions , the recur@@ rence cy@@ te value should be determined and the usual causes for non @-@ response ( iron , fo@@ lic acid or vitamin B@@ 12 deficiency , al@@ umin@@ escence fixation , infections or inflamm@@ ations , blood loss and hem@@ oly@@ sis ) are examined . &quot;
&quot; if the recur@@ rence cy@@ te value , taking account of an@@ a@@ emia ( i.e. the Re@@ tik@@ u@@ lo@@ cytes &quot; Index &quot; ) , is lower ( &lt; 20,000 / mm@@ 3 or &lt; 0.5 % ) , the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te and leu@@ ko@@ cy@@ te numbers should be determined , and if no other reason of an effective loss is found , the anti @-@ ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin antibodies should be determined and an examination of the bone mar@@ row will be considered to be diagnosed with a PR@@ CA . &quot;
the data on immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in sub@@ cut@@ aneous use of ab@@ se@@ amed in patients with a risk for an anti @-@ body @-@ induced PR@@ CA ( patients with ren@@ al an@@ a@@ emia ) are not sufficient .
&quot; 8 For patients with chronic kidney failure , maintenance therapy should not exceed the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration under section 4.2 . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , increased mortality risk and risk of serious cardiovascular events were observed when ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis @-@ stimulating active substances ( ESA ) were given with a hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of over 12 g / dl ( 7.5 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) . &quot;
controlled clinical studies have shown no significant benefit that is due to the administration of epo@@ et@@ ins if the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in concentration is increased by the concentration needed to control the an@@ a@@ emia symptoms and the prevention of blood trans@@ fu@@ sions .
the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in should amount to approximately 1 g / dl ( 0.@@ 62 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month and should not exceed 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) per month in order to minimize the risk of an increase in high blood pressure .
&quot; in patients with chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically evident cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure , maintenance therapy should not be exceeded under section 4.2 , the upper limit of the hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration . &quot;
&quot; according to these findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa in adults with ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
&quot; in tumour patients under chemotherapy , a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ administration and ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin response should be taken into account for the evaluation of the therapeutic efficiency of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa ( patients that may have to be trans@@ fi@@ gured ) . &quot;
&quot; if the H@@ b increase is higher than 2 g / dl ( 1.@@ 25 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) is exceeded per month or a H@@ b value of 13 g / dl ( 8,@@ 1 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , the dose must be adjusted in accordance with section 4.2 to minimize the risk of potential thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic events ( see section 4.2 for patients with chem@@ otherapeu@@ tic an@@ a@@ emia - dosage adjustment with the aim of keeping the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value between 10 g / dl and 12 g / dl ) . &quot;
the decision for the application of re@@ combin@@ ant ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ine should be based on a benefit @-@ risk assessment involving the involvement of the respective patient which should also take into account the specific clinical context .
patients who are intended for a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should be examined and treated according to the cause of an@@ a@@ emia prior to epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa therapy .
&quot; patients who undergo a larger elec@@ tive orthop@@ a@@ edic surgery should receive adequate thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis proph@@ yla@@ xis , as they have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular diseases , especially with underlying cardiovascular disease . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it cannot be ruled out that for patients with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , an increased risk for post @-@ operative thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic / vascular events can exist for patients with an initial dietary supplement of &gt; 13 g / dl . &quot;
&quot; in several controlled trials , epo@@ e@@ ins have not been proven to improve overall survival in tumour patients with symptom@@ atic an@@ a@@ emia , or reduce the risk of tumour progression . &quot;
4 months in patients with metastatic breast cancer who received chemotherapy when a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in target concentration of 12 - 14 g / dl ( 7.5 - 8.@@ 7 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) was as@@ pi@@ red
&quot; if epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is used together with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in , the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in should be controlled and the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in dose should be adjusted to the rising hem@@ at@@ ok@@ rit . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies in tumor tissues , there is no evidence of an interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F concerning hem@@ at@@ ological differentiation or proliferation . &quot;

the most common side effect during treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is a dose @-@ dependent increase in blood pressure or the deterioration of an existing hyper@@ tension .
increased incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ vascular events ( see section 4.4 and section 4.@@ 8 - General ) was observed in patients under treatment with ery@@ thro@@ po@@ et@@ ines .
&quot; regardless of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin treatment , it can occur in surgical patients with cardiovascular disease after repeated blood donations to thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic and vascular complications . &quot;
&quot; the genetically derived epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa is gly@@ co@@ si@@ fied and identical to the amino acids and carbohydr@@ ate content , identical to endo@@ genous human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , which was isolated from the urine of an@@ a@@ emia patients . &quot;
&quot; it could be shown with the help of cultures of human bone mar@@ row cells , that epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa specifically stimulates ery@@ thro@@ po@@ esis and does not affect leu@@ kop@@ o@@ esis . &quot;

survival and progression progression were examined in five large controlled trials with a total of 28@@ 33 patients ; four of these trials were double blind placebo @-@ controlled trials and
in the open study there was no difference in overall survival between the patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin and the control patient .
&quot; in these studies , patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin showed an un@@ explained , statisti@@ cally significantly higher mortality compared to controls . &quot;
overall survival in the studies could not be explained by differences in the incidence of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis and related complications in patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; there is an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bo@@ em@@ bol@@ ic events in tumour patients treated with re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin , and a negative impact on overall survival cannot be excluded . &quot;
&quot; it is not clear how far these results are transferred to the use of re@@ combin@@ ant human ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin in tumour patients , who are treated with chemotherapy with the goal of reaching a ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value under 13 g / dl , because too few patients with these characteristics were included in the examined data . &quot;
epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ regulations after repeated intraven@@ ous application showed a half @-@ life of about 4 hours in healthy volunteers and a slightly extended half @-@ life of about 5 hours in patients with kidney failure .
&quot; after sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection , the serum levels of epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa are much lower than the serum levels obtained after intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; there is no stimulation : the serum levels remain the same , regardless of whether they are determined 24 hours after the first gift or 24 hours after the last gift . &quot;
( bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis is a known complic@@ ation of chronic kidney failure in humans and could be due to secondary hyper@@ par@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m or unknown factors .
&quot; in a study of her@@ edi@@ atric patients treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa for three years , the incidence of bone mar@@ row fibro@@ sis was not increased compared to the control group with di@@ aly@@ sis patients not treated with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa . &quot;
&quot; 14 In animal studies with nearly the 20@@ x of the recommended weekly dose , epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa led to reduced f@@ ö@@ tal@@ em body weight , a delay of the oscill@@ ation and a rise in fet@@ al mortality . &quot;
&quot; these reports are based on in vitro diagnostic findings with human tumor tissue samples , which are of uncertain significance for the clinical situation . &quot;
&quot; within the framework of an out@@ patient application , the patient may store the stre@@ amed stre@@ amed for a maximum of 3 days outside of the fridge and not above 25 ° C . &quot;

&quot; prior to the market launch and according to agreement with the competent authorities of member states , the holder of the marketing authorization has to provide medical specialists in di@@ aly@@ sis centres and retail outlets with the following information and materials : • Training brochure • Sum@@ m@@ ary of the characteristics of the medicine ( specialist information ) , labelling and packaging support . &quot;
&quot; the holder of the authorization for the marketing authorization has to ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system introduced in version 3.0 and implemented in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application , before the medicine is put into circulation and as long as it is used in the transport . &quot;
&quot; the holder of approval for the marketing authorisation is obliged to undertake the risk management plan specified in the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan , as agreed in version 5 of the Risk Management Plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.@@ 2. update of the risk management plan adopted by the CH@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; an updated R@@ MP should be provided in accordance with the &quot; CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline on Risk Management Systems for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use &quot; at the same time , with the next updated report on the safety of the drug ( Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report , P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , an updated R@@ MP should be submitted : • When receiving new information , the influence on the current safety specifications ( Safety Speci@@ fication ) , pharmac@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ance plan or risk reduction measures could have occurred within 60 days of reaching an important ( the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance or risk reduction ) mil@@ estones • by request by the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; • If you suffer from a heart attack or stroke within a month before your treatment , if you suffer from unstable ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is ( for the first time , or increased chest pain ) , the risk of a blood @-@ graf@@ ting in the veins ( deep ven@@ ous thro@@ mb@@ oses ) exists - if , for example , such a blood @-@ gra@@ ft occurred for you , for example . &quot;
&quot; you suffer from severe circul@@ atory disorders of the heart ( cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , arter@@ ies of the legs or arms ( peripheral arter@@ ial oc@@ clu@@ sion ) , the cervi@@ cal arter@@ ies ( vascular disease of the carot@@ id arter@@ ies ) or the brain ( cereb@@ rov@@ ascular disease ) , you have recently had a heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; during the treatment with ab@@ se@@ amed , it can occur within the normal range to a light dose @-@ dependent increase in the number of blood counts , which is re@@ formed during further treatment . &quot;
your doctor may conduct regular blood tests if necessary to regularly check the number of plat@@ el@@ ets during the first 8 weeks of treatment .
&quot; lack of iron , dis@@ integration of red blood cells ( hem@@ oly@@ sis ) , blood loss , vitamin B@@ 12 or fo@@ lic acid deficiency should be considered and treated with ab@@ se@@ amed prior to the onset of therapy . &quot;
very rare was reported on the appearance of an anti@@ endo@@ genous ery@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a after mon@@ e@@ - to years of treatment with sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin spra@@ yed ) ery@@ thro@@ poe@@ tin .
&quot; if you suffer from Er@@ y@@ thro@@ bla@@ stom@@ a , it will break off your therapy with ab@@ err@@ stre@@ amed and determine how your an@@ a@@ emia is best treated . &quot;
&quot; therefore , di@@ ec@@ amed must be given by injection into a vein ( intraven@@ ous ) if you are treated for an an@@ a@@ emia due to kidney disease . &quot;
a high ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value may cause problems with the heart or blood vessels and the risk of dying could be increased .
&quot; in the case of increased or rising potassium levels , your doctor can take into account an inter@@ ruption of the treatment with ab@@ sent@@ stre@@ amed until the potassium levels lie back in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from chronic kidney failure and clin@@ ically obvious cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease or con@@ ges@@ tion signs due to insufficient cardiac output , your doctor will ensure that your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror does not exceed a certain value . &quot;
&quot; according to the present findings , the treatment of an@@ a@@ emia with ab@@ se@@ amed in adults with chronic kidney failure ( ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ) , which are not yet di@@ aly@@ sis , will not accelerate the progression of ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
a 2 - 3 @-@ week delay between epo@@ e@@ tin @-@ al@@ fa @-@ giving and the desired effect should be taken into account for assessing the efficacy of ab@@ sent@@ stre@@ amed .
200 Your doctor will regularly determine your red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) and adjust your t@@ amed dose accordingly to minimize the risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic formation ( thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic event ) as low as possible .
&quot; this risk should be weighed very carefully over the benefits derived from the treatment with epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa , especially if you have an increased risk of thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events , e.g. if you are obes@@ e ( obes@@ e ) or if in the past thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic vascular events have occurred ( e.g. a deep ven@@ ous thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis or lung em@@ bol@@ ism ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are cancer patient , bear in mind that stre@@ amed stre@@ amed like a growth factor for blood cells and under certain circumstances can affect the tumor neg@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; if you need a larger orthop@@ edic surgery , the cause of your an@@ a@@ emia should be examined and treated accordingly . &quot;
&quot; if your values of the red blood dy@@ e ( ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ) are too high , you should not receive ab@@ sent@@ stre@@ amed because there is an increased risk of blood drop after surgery . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you use / use other medicines or have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; if you are taking C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( means of supp@@ ressing the immune system ) during your therapy with ab@@ sent@@ stre@@ amed , your doctor may need to arrange certain blood tests to measure the blood levels of C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
&quot; laboratory tests have no interaction between epo@@ e@@ tin al@@ fa and G @-@ CS@@ F or GM @-@ CS@@ F ( G @-@ CS@@ F and GM @-@ CS@@ F are a means of building up the immune system , for example in cancer chemotherapy or HIV ) . &quot;
&quot; depending on how your an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until your condition is under control . &quot;
your doctor may arrange regular blood tests if necessary to check the treatment success and make sure that the medicine works properly and your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed certain value .
&quot; once you are well adjusted , you will receive regular doses of ab@@ err@@ stre@@ amed between 25 and 50 I.@@ U. / kg twice a week , spread over two equally large inj@@ ections . &quot;
&quot; your doctor may , if necessary , arrange regular blood tests to verify the success of your treatment and make sure your ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed certain value . &quot;
&quot; depending on how an@@ emia refers to the treatment , the dose can be adjusted approximately every four weeks until the condition is under control . &quot;
&quot; to ensure this and make sure the ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in value does not exceed a certain value , the doctor will conduct regular blood tests . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary to shor@@ ten the treatment time before surgery , a dose of 300 I.@@ U. / kg can be given to 10 consecutive days before surgery , on the day of operation and another 4 days after surgery . &quot;
&quot; however , if your doctor considers this to be appropriate , you can also learn how to sp@@ lash the stre@@ amed herself under the skin . &quot;

&quot; when a sy@@ ringe has been taken out of the refrigerator and room temperature has reached ( up to 25 ° C ) , it must be used either within 3 days or be rejected . &quot;
A@@ cla@@ sta is used to treat the following diseases : o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease which makes bones br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause as well as in men .
&quot; it is used in patients with a high risk of frac@@ ture ( bone frac@@ tures ) , including in patients who recently suffered a minor trau@@ matic her@@ nia as with H@@ inf@@ estation ; • Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone , a disease that changes the normal course of bone growth . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get should take at least 500 mg of calcium twice daily for at least 10 days after the treatment ; patients with hip frac@@ ture should obtain a large dose of vitamin D ( 50 000 to 125 000 IE ) before the first in@@ fusion or by injection into a muscle . &quot;
&quot; the administration of par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ( remedy against inflammation ) shortly after the application of A@@ cla@@ sta can reduce symptoms , such as fever , muscle pain , flu @-@ like symptoms , joint pain and head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta is only prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of this disease . &quot;
&quot; as the active ingredient in A@@ cla@@ sta is the same as in Z@@ omet@@ a , a part of the data material for Z@@ omet@@ a was used to evaluate A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; the first study included almost 8@@ ,000 elderly women with o@@ steopor@@ osis , and the number of spine and hip frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of three years . &quot;
the second study included 2 127 men and women with o@@ steopor@@ osis over 50 years who had recently undergone a hip frac@@ ture ; the number of frac@@ tures has been studied over a period of up to five years .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta was tested in two studies on a total of 3@@ 57 patients and compared to Ris@@ or@@ ron@@ at ( a different bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate ) for six months . &quot;
&quot; the main indicator for the efficacy was , whether the alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase in serum ( an enzyme that breaks down bone substance ) in the blood again norm@@ alized or decreased by at least 75 % compared to the bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; in the study of older women , the risk of frac@@ tures in patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( excluding other o@@ steopor@@ osis cases ) was reduced by 70 % over a period of three years compared to the patients . &quot;
&quot; compared to all patients under A@@ cla@@ sta ( with or without o@@ steopor@@ osis treatment ) , the risk of hip frac@@ tures was reduced by 41 % . &quot;
&quot; in the study of men and women with hip frac@@ ture , 9 % of patients under A@@ cla@@ sta had a frac@@ ture ( 92 of 1 0@@ 65 ) compared to 13 % of patients under placebo ( 139 of 1 0@@ 62 ) . &quot;
most A@@ cla@@ sta &apos;s side effects occur within the first three days after in@@ fusion and are less frequent in repeated in@@ fu@@ sions .
A@@ cla@@ sta must not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid or other bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate or any other ingredient .
&quot; as with all bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , patients with A@@ cla@@ sta undergo the risk of kidney problems , reactions to the in@@ fusion site and o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( loss of bone tissue ) in the jaw . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of A@@ cla@@ sta provides educational material for physicians who prescri@@ be A@@ cla@@ sta for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis , which contains information about how to use the medicine , as well as similar material for patients where the side effects of the medicine are explained and pointed out when they should contact the doctor . &quot;
&quot; in April 2005 , the European Commission granted Nov@@ arti@@ s Euro@@ ph@@ arm Limited a permit for the transport of A@@ cla@@ sta in the entire European Union . &quot;

&quot; o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The treatment supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • Re@@ quired for appropriate dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing care &quot;
&quot; treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis • in post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al women • in men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis and o@@ steopor@@ osis in men , an intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 5 mg A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended once a year . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture , the administration of the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta is recommended two or more weeks after the operative care of the hip frac@@ ture ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta should only be prescribed by doctors who have experience in the treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get . &quot;
after treatment of the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get with A@@ cla@@ sta a long period of re@@ mission was observed in patients who responded to the therapy ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , it is advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the first A@@ cla@@ sta in@@ fusion . &quot;
the frequency of symptoms appearing within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by giving par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen short after the use of A@@ cla@@ sta .
patients with kidney function disorders ( see section 4.4 ) In patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended as limited clinical experience for this patient population is available .
&quot; elderly patients ( ≥ 65 years ) A dose adjustment is not necessary , since the bio@@ availability , distribution and elimination of older patients is similar to younger patients . &quot;
children and young people A@@ cla@@ sta are not recommended for use in children under 18 years of age because data about safety and efficacy are missing .
A@@ cla@@ sta is not recommended for patients with severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance &lt; 35 ml / min ) since only limited clinical experience exists for these patients .
pre @-@ existing hypo@@ kal@@ emia must be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta through sufficient intake of calcium and vitamin D before the beginning of the treatment ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop , whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , twice daily at least 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; cancer , chemotherapy , treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , bad oral hygiene ) should be considered before applying bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates a dental examination with appropriate preventive dental treatment . &quot;
&quot; for patients needing dental access , no data is available whether the inter@@ ruption of bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate treatment reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the jaw area . &quot;
the clinical evaluation by the attending physician should be the basis for the treatment plan of each patient and based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
the frequency of symptoms appearing within the first three days after ad@@ minist@@ ering A@@ cla@@ sta can be reduced by giving par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol or i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen short after the use of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) .
patients who received A@@ cla@@ sta increased ( 1.3 % ) ( 51 of 3.@@ 8@@ 62 ) compared to patients receiving placebo ( 0.@@ 6 % ) ( 22 of 3,@@ 8@@ 52 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ steopor@@ osis studies ( PFT , H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON - Rec@@ ur@@ rent Fra@@ cture Trial ) were comparable to the overall frequency of atri@@ al fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ation between A@@ cla@@ sta ( 2.6 % ) and placebo ( 2.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , common ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse drug effects are listed in Table 1 . &quot;
&quot; ren@@ al dysfunction of Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid was associated with kidney function disorders , which proved to be a decrease of the ren@@ al function ( i.e. an increase in serum cre@@ atine ) and in rare cases referred to as acute ren@@ al failure . &quot;
the changes in the cre@@ atine @-@ clearance ( measured annually prior to administration ) and the appearance of kidney failure as well as reduced kidney function were comparable to the A@@ cla@@ sta@@ - and placebo group in a clinical trial for o@@ steopor@@ osis .
a temporary increase in serum cre@@ atine within 10 days of administration was observed in 1.8 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 0.8 % of patients treated with placebo .
&quot; based on laboratory findings , the temporary asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic calcium values , which were below the normal fluctu@@ ation area ( less than 2.@@ 10 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) , were compared to 21 % of patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta in the Pa@@ get @-@ Pa@@ get trials . &quot;
&quot; all patients received supple@@ mental doses of vitamin D and calcium in the post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis study , in the study on preventing clinical frac@@ tures after a hip frac@@ ture and in the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get studies ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study to avoid clinical frac@@ tures after a recently suffered hip frac@@ ture , the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D prior to the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; local reactions After the administration of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in a large clinical trial was reported on local reactions to the in@@ fusion site , such as redness , swelling and / or pain ( 0.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis in the max@@ il@@ lo@@ facial area has been reported , especially in cancer patients , over o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ ro@@ sis ( primary in the jaw area ) , which were treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates , including z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid . &quot;
&quot; many of these patients had signs of local infections including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis , and most of the reports refer to cancer patients after tooth extraction or other dental sur@@ geri@@ es . &quot;
&quot; 7 study of 7,@@ 7@@ 36 patients oc@@ cured O@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose in the jaw area with an A@@ cla@@ sta and placebo @-@ treated patients . &quot;
&quot; in the case of over@@ dose , leading to clin@@ ically relevant hypo@@ kal@@ emia , a balance can be achieved by giving oral calcium and / or intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of calcium glu@@ con@@ ate . &quot;
clinical efficacy in the treatment of post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ osis ( PFT ) The efficacy and safety of A@@ cla@@ sta 5 mg once a year for 3 consecutive years was shown in post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al women ( 7.@@ 7@@ 36 females aged between 65 and 89 years ) with either a bone density value ( BM@@ D ) -@@ T @-@ S@@ core for the fem@@ ur h@@ as ≤ -@@ 2.5 with or without signs of an existing spine frac@@ ture .
effects on morph@@ ometric spine frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta lowered significantly over a period of three years and after one year the frequency of one or more new verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures ( see Table 2 ) .
A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated patients of 75 years and over had a 60 % reduced risk of verteb@@ ral frac@@ tures compared to placebo patients ( p &lt; 0.00@@ 01 ) .
&quot; effects on hip frac@@ tures A@@ cla@@ sta showed a consistent effect over three years , which resulted in a reduced risk of hip frac@@ tures in one by 41 % ( 95 % CI , 17 % to 58 % ) . &quot;
&quot; bone density ( BM@@ D ) A@@ cla@@ sta increased bone density on lum@@ bar verteb@@ rate , hip and dist@@ al radius compared to placebo treatment at all times ( 6 , 12 , 24 and 36 months ) . &quot;
&quot; 9 In@@ cre@@ ase the bone density of the lum@@ bar spine by 6.@@ 7 % , the entire hip by 6.0 % , the fem@@ ur neck by 5.1 % and the dist@@ al radius by 3.2 % . &quot;
bone hist@@ ology in the case of 152 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al o@@ steopor@@ otic patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta ( N = 82 ) or placebo ( N = 70 ) were taken from the pel@@ vic area a year after the third annual dose of bone biop@@ si@@ es .
a micro@@ computer tom@@ ography ( µ@@ CT ) analysis showed patients treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to placebo an increase in the tra@@ be@@ cular bone volume and the preservation of the traditional bone structure .
&quot; bone @-@ specific alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( B@@ SAP ) , the N @-@ termin@@ ale pro@@ pep@@ tide of type II col@@ lagen ( P@@ 1@@ NP ) in serum and the beta @-@ C tel@@ op@@ ep@@ tide ( b @-@ CT@@ x ) in serum was determined in sub@@ groups of 5@@ 17 to 1,@@ 24@@ 6 patients in periods of study duration . &quot;
&quot; after 12 months , the treatment with an annual 5 mg dose of A@@ cla@@ sta reduced significantly by 30 % compared to bas@@ eline and was kept at 28 % below the initial value up to 36 months . &quot;
P@@ 1@@ NP was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 52 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
B @-@ CT@@ x was significantly reduced by 61 % below the initial value after 12 months and was kept at 55 % below the initial value up to 36 months .
&quot; the vitamin D levels were not rout@@ inely measured , but the majority of patients received an initial dose of vitamin D ( 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ mus@@ cul@@ arly ) 2 weeks before in@@ fusion . &quot;
total mort@@ ality was 10 % ( 101 patients ) in the group treated with A@@ cla@@ sta compared to 13 % ( 141 patients ) in the placebo group .
effect on bone mineral density ( BM@@ D ) In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON @-@ R@@ FT study increased A@@ cla@@ sta treatment compared to placebo treatment the BM@@ D at the total th@@ igh and fem@@ oral neck at all times .
the A@@ cla@@ sta treatment led over 24 months versus placebo treatment to increase BM@@ D by 5.@@ 4 % at the total and 4.3 % on the fem@@ ur neck .
&quot; clinical efficacy in men In the H@@ OR@@ I@@ Z@@ ON R@@ FT study , 50@@ 8 men were random@@ ized and in 185 patients the BM@@ D was evaluated after 24 months . &quot;
the study was not designed to show a reduction in clinical frac@@ tures in men ; the incidence of clinical frac@@ tures was 7.5 % in A@@ cla@@ sta @-@ treated men compared to 8.@@ 7 % in placebo .
&quot; in another study in males ( study CZ@@ O@@ L@@ 4@@ 46@@ M@@ 230@@ 8 ) , the once annual administration of Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at was not inferior to the percentage change in the lum@@ bar verteb@@ ra@@ e BM@@ D after 24 months compared to bas@@ eline value . &quot;
clinical efficacy of the treatment at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get of the bone A@@ cla@@ sta has been studied in patients and patients aged 30 years with radi@@ ologically confirmed primary serum levels ( moderate serum levels of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase according to the age specific upper normal value for inclusion in the study ) .
11 The effectiveness of an in@@ fusion of 5 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in comparison to the consumption of 30 mg of ris@@ ed@@ ron@@ ate once a day for 2 months has been proven in two six month comparative studies .
&quot; in the combined results , a similar decrease in pain intensity and pain influence was observed after 6 months compared to the bas@@ eline for A@@ cla@@ sta and Ris@@ or@@ ron@@ at . &quot;
patients who were classified as Respon@@ der at the end of the six @-@ month main study ( responded to the therapy ) could be included in a follow @-@ up phase .
&quot; from the 143 with A@@ cla@@ sta and the 107 treated patients who participated in the follow @-@ up study , the therapeutic response in 141 of the patients treated with ris@@ ed@@ ron could be maintained in an average duration of the follow @-@ up period of 18 months after the application . &quot;
&quot; one @-@ time and multiple 5 and 15 minutes lasting in@@ fu@@ sions of 2 , 4 , 8 and 16 mg of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in 64 patients showed the following pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data which proved to be dos@@ is@@ eless . &quot;
&quot; after that the plasma level rapidly decreased to &lt; 10 % of the maximum value after 4 h and &lt; 1 % after 24 h , followed by a long phase of very low concentration , no more than 0.1 % of the maximum value . &quot;
&quot; rapid bio @-@ phase disappearance from the large cycle with half @-@ value @-@ times t ½ α 0.@@ 24 and t ½ β 1.@@ 87 hours , followed by a long elimination phase with a terminal elimination rate of ½ g 146 hours . &quot;
the early distribution phases ( α and β with the above t ½ -@@ values ) probably represent the fast resor@@ ption in the bones and ex@@ cre@@ tion over the kidneys .
&quot; in the first 24 hours , 39 ± 16 % of the administered dose is found in the urine , while the rest is mainly bound to bone tissue . &quot;
&quot; the total body @-@ clearance amounts to 5.@@ 04 ± 2,5 l / h regardless of the dose and remains unaffected by sex , age , race or body weight . &quot;
&quot; an extension of the in@@ fusion time of 5 to 15 minutes resulted in the decrease of the Z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid concentration by 30 % at the end of the in@@ fusion , but had no effect on the surface under the curve ( plasma concentrations against time ) . &quot;
&quot; a dimin@@ ished clearance of the met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed substances met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by cy@@ to@@ chrome @-@ P@@ 450 enzyme systems is unlikely , because zinc cit@@ ric acid is not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in humans and because it is a weak or no direct and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible , material @-@ dependent inhibit@@ or of the P@@ 4@@ 50@@ - &quot;
special patient groups ( see section 4.2 ) The ren@@ al clearance of the z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron acid cor@@ related with the Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ( 75 ± 33 % of the cre@@ atine @-@ clear@@ ance ) and was 84 ± 29 ml / min ( range 22 to 143 ml / min ) in the 64 examined patients .
this results in a slight ( cl@@ c@@ r = 50 - 80 ml / min ) and a moderate ren@@ al dysfunction down to a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance up to 35 ml / min does not require any dosage adjustment of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid .
&quot; since severe ren@@ al dysfunction ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min ) is only available , no statements are possible for this population . &quot;
acute toxic@@ ity The highest non @-@ let@@ al@@ able intraven@@ ous single dose was 10 mg / kg body weight in mice and at rats 0.@@ 6 mg / kg body weight .
&quot; in studies on dogs , single doses of 1.0 mg / kg ( based on the AU@@ C the 6@@ times the recommended human @-@ therapeutic exposure ) were administered over a period of 15 minutes , good and without a ren@@ al influence . &quot;
&quot; chronic and chronic toxic@@ ity in studies with intraven@@ ous application was given the ren@@ al toler@@ ability of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid in rats , ranging from 0.@@ 6 mg / kg as a 15 @-@ minute in@@ fusion in 3 @-@ day intervals , ranging in intervals of 2- 3 weeks ( a cum@@ ulative dose that corresponds to the 7@@ x of human @-@ therapeutic exposure related to AU@@ C ) . &quot;
&quot; long @-@ term studies with repeated use in accumulated ex@@ positions sufficiently exceeded the maximum of the intended human exposure were toxic@@ ological effects in other organs , including gastro@@ intestinal tract and liver , and intraven@@ ous injection . &quot;
&quot; the most common occurrence in studies with repeated use was an increased primary spon@@ gi@@ osa in the Met@@ ap@@ hy@@ se of the long bones in animals in the growth phase with nearly all dos@@ ages , a finding that reflects the pharmac@@ ological , anti@@ absor@@ p@@ tive effect of the substance . &quot;
at rats we observed a ter@@ ato@@ gen@@ ic@@ ity in dos@@ ages from 0.2 mg / kg as outer and inner ( vis@@ cer@@ al ) ab@@ norm@@ alities and such of the skel@@ eton .
&quot; no ter@@ ato@@ genic effects or embryo @-@ fet@@ al effects were observed in rab@@ bits , although the mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity was pronounced at 0.1 mg / kg as a result of low serum @-@ calcium levels . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time after preparation and the conditions before the application ; normally , 24 hours at 2 ° C to 8 ° C should not be exceeded . &quot;

&quot; o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women and men with increased risk of frac@@ tures , including patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; the patient information package should be provided and the following core messages include : • The treatment supplement • contra@@ indication in pregnancy and lac@@ t@@ ating women • Re@@ quired for appropriate dietary intake of calcium and vitamin D , appropriate physical activity , non @-@ smoking and a healthy diet 17 • Import@@ ant signs and symptoms for serious side effects • When to resort to medical or nursing care &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system described in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the Au@@ thor@@ isation Application is in force and works before and while the product is marketed . &quot;
&quot; Ris@@ ko Management Plan The holder of approval for the transport company comm@@ its itself to the trials and additional activities related to pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance , which are presented in the pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan of the approved version 00@@ 4 of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) in Module 1.@@ 8.2 of the authorisation application and all the following approved versions of the R@@ MP . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline for Risk Management Systems for Human Use , the revised R@@ MP should be submitted together with the next &quot; Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report &quot; ( P@@ SU@@ R ) . &quot;
&quot; an over@@ worked R@@ MP should be submitted • If new information is known , which could affect the current statements on safety , pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance plan or activities to minimize the risk . • Wi@@ thin 60 days if an important milestone ( for pharmac@@ o@@ virus or risk reduction ) was reached . &quot;
&quot; z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid is a representative of a substance called bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate , and is used for the treatment of o@@ steopor@@ osis in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women , o@@ steopor@@ osis in men and the Pa@@ get of the bone . &quot;
&quot; decreasing blood levels of sex hormones , especially est@@ ro@@ gens that are made of and@@ ro@@ gens , play a role in the rather gradual loss of bone mass observed in men . &quot;
&quot; with the Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get the bone reconstruction is too fast , and new bone material is structured uni@@ form@@ ly , which weak@@ ens the bone material than normal . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cla@@ sta works by norm@@ alizing the bone structure , thereby ensuring normal bone formation and thus rein@@ forcing the bone to strength . &quot;
&quot; if you are in dental treatment or undergo a dental surgery , tell your doctor that you will be treated with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you are using A@@ cla@@ sta with other medicines please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if you use / use other medicines / have recently taken / used , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; for your doctor , it is particularly important to know if you are taking drugs , of which it is known that they damage the kidneys . &quot;
&quot; when using A@@ cla@@ sta together with food and drink , you are concerned that in accordance with the instructions of your doctor , you take sufficient liquid before and after the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
o@@ steopor@@ osis The usual dose is 5 mg once a year which is administered to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; if you have recently broken the hips , it is recommended to take A@@ cla@@ sta two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
the usual dose is 5 mg given to you by your doctor or the nursing staff as an in@@ fusion in a vein .
&quot; as A@@ cla@@ sta works for a long time , you may need another dose only after a year or longer . &quot;
it is important to follow these instructions carefully so that the calcium levels in your blood will not be too low in time after in@@ fusion .
&quot; at Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , A@@ cla@@ sta can work for more than a year , and your doctor will inform you if you need a new treatment . &quot;
&quot; if the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta is missed , you will get in touch with your doctor or hospital immediately to make an appointment . &quot;
&quot; before the treatment is terminated with A@@ cla@@ sta if you consider the completion of the treatment with A@@ cla@@ sta , please come to your next doctor &apos;s appointment and discuss this with your doctor . &quot;
side effects associated with the first in@@ fusion occur very often ( with more than 30 % of patients ) but are less common after the subsequent in@@ fusion .
&quot; fever and ch@@ ills , muscle or joint pain and head@@ aches , occur within the first three days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; currently it is unclear whether A@@ cla@@ sta causes this irregular heart@@ beat , but you should tell your doctor if you have received such symptoms after you have received A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; physical signs because of too low calcium concentration in the blood , such as muscle cra@@ mps or ting@@ ling or num@@ b@@ ness , especially in the area around the mouth . &quot;
&quot; headache , in@@ som@@ nia , fatigue , ting@@ ling , diar@@ rho@@ ea , diar@@ rho@@ ea , stomach upset , stomach pain , headache , loss of pain , loss of pain , swelling of the skin , pain , it@@ ching , red@@ dish skin , frequent ur@@ ination , temporary increase of serum cre@@ atine , tissue wa@@ vy and thirst . &quot;
persistent pain and / or not healing wounds in the mouth or jaw were reported mainly in patients treated with bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates for other diseases .
&quot; allergic reactions , including rare cases of respiratory problems , hi@@ ves and angi@@ o@@ ede@@ ma ( such as swelling in the face , tongue or throat ) , was reported . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor , pharmac@@ ist or nursing staff if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not listed in this information information . &quot;
&quot; if the medicine is not used immediately , the user is responsible for the storage time and conditions of the application up to the application ; normally , 24 h should not be exceeded at 2 ° C to 8 ° C. &quot;
&quot; in patients with a low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture suffered recently , A@@ cla@@ sta &apos;s in@@ fusion is recommended two or more weeks after the surgical treatment of the hip frac@@ ture . &quot;
&quot; before and after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta , patients must be adequately supplied with liquid ; this is particularly important in patients receiving di@@ ure@@ tic therapy . &quot;
&quot; due to the rapid implementation of the effect of z@@ ol@@ ed@@ ron@@ y@@ lic acid on bone reconstruction , a temporary , sometimes symptom@@ atic , hypo@@ kal@@ emia can develop whose maximum occurs usually within the first 10 days after the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is advisable to ensure an adequate intake of calcium in patients with Mor@@ bus Pa@@ get , at least twice daily 500 mg of elementary calcium , for at least 10 days after the administration of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a recently suffered low @-@ trau@@ matic hip frac@@ ture an initial dose of 50,000 to 12@@ 5,000 I.@@ U. or@@ ally or intra@@ muscular vitamin D is recommended before the in@@ fusion of A@@ cla@@ sta . &quot;
&quot; if you require further information about your disease or treatment , please read the package insert ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) or contact your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is additionally applied to a diet and exercise for the treatment of adult patients • obesity ( abnormal obesity ) with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 30 kg / m ² or above and above ( BM@@ I of 27 kg / m ² or above ) and beyond that one or more I
&quot; in addition , four studies have been conducted to more than 7@@ ,000 patients in which A@@ comp@@ lia was used compared to a placebo as a suppor@@ tive remedy for smoking . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the studies on the adjustment of smoking showed no uniform results , so that the effect of A@@ comp@@ lia was difficult to assess on this application . &quot;
&quot; what risk is associated with A@@ comp@@ lia ? it The most common side effects of A@@ comp@@ lia , which were observed during the trials ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) , were nausea and infections of the upper respiratory tract . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who suffer from an existing severe depression or be treated with anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants , as it can increase the risk of depression and , among other things , provoke a small minority of patients su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts . &quot;
&quot; caution is advisable while using A@@ comp@@ lia using medicines such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole or I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole ( medicines for fung@@ al infections ) , Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( a means of using HI@@ V@@ - Inf@@ ection ) , T@@ eli@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or Cl@@ ari@@ o@@ my@@ cin ( antibiotics ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the efficacy of A@@ comp@@ lia in terms of weight reduction in patients with obesity or overweight

&quot; in addition to diet and exercise for the treatment of obesity ( BM@@ I ≥ 30 kg / m ² ) or overweight patients ( BM@@ I &gt; 27 kg / m ² ) , which additionally have one or more risk factors such as type 2 diabetes or dy@@ sli@@ p@@ ide@@ mia ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
A@@ comp@@ lia is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under the age of 18 due to the lack of data on efficacy and safety .
&quot; depres@@ sive disorders or changes in mood with depres@@ sive symptoms were reported at up to 10 % , su@@ ici@@ dal thoughts of up to 1 % of patients receiving Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in case of depres@@ sive disorders , Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant may not be used unless the benefit of treatment in the individual case predomin@@ ates the risk ( see section 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients who - beside the obesity - have no apparent risks , depres@@ sive reactions can occur . &quot;
relatives or other related persons have to point out that it is necessary to monitor the new occurrence of such symptoms and immediately obtain medical advice if these symptoms occur . l@@ n
• Ol@@ der patients The efficacy and safety of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in the treatment of patients over 75 years have not been sufficiently demonstrated .
patients with cardiovascular event ( m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or stroke etc . ) less than 6 months ago were excluded from studies with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant .

&quot; 5.3 Pre@@ clinical data for the safety of the following adverse effects , which were not observed in clinical studies , which occurred in animals after exposure in the human therapeutic area , were assessed as potentially relevant for clinical application : &quot;
&quot; in some , however , not in all cases , the beginning of conv@@ ul@@ sions may seem to be associated with process @-@ related stress such as dealing with animals . &quot;
&quot; Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant was given over a longer period prior to mat@@ ing ( 9 weeks ) , which allowed recovery from the initial effects of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant , so no unwanted effects on fertility or cycle disorders were observed . &quot;
the influence of Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant on pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development was studied at the rat in doses of up to 10 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in a study on rats for pre@@ - and post@@ nat@@ al development , an exposure with Rim@@ on@@ ab@@ ant in uter@@ o and lac@@ tation had no changes in learning behaviour or memory . &quot;

&quot; summary of the EP@@ AR for the public The present document is a summary of the European Public De@@ dic@@ ation Report ( EP@@ AR ) , which explains how the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) has assessed the studies conducted to make recommendations regarding the use of the drug . &quot;
Ac@@ tos is used to treat type 2 diabetes ( also known as non @-@ insulin @-@ dependent diabetes ) . • It can be used alone ( mon@@ otherapy ) in patients ( especially overweight patients ) where met@@ form@@ in ( a diabetes medication ) is not indicated .
&quot; it can be applied in addition to met@@ form@@ in in patients ( especially overweight patients ) , which cannot be adequately adjusted with met@@ form@@ in alone in the highest tolerated dose . &quot;
&quot; in combination with a sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin , the previous dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or insulin can be retained with the start of the acet@@ yl@@ ated medication , except in patients with hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia ( low blood sugar ) ; here , the dose of the sul@@ fon@@ yl resin or the insulin should be reduced . &quot;
&quot; this means that the body &apos;s insulin can be better utilized and the blood sugar level decreases , which makes type 2 diabetes better . &quot;
&quot; in more than 1,@@ 400 patients the efficacy of acet@@ oni@@ de was studied in triple therapy ; the patients received a combination of met@@ form@@ in with a sul@@ phon@@ ate resin , in addition they received either Ac@@ tos or placebo for up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; in the studies the concentration of a substance in the blood ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; an account resulted in lowering the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c value , suggest@@ ing that the blood sugar levels were reduced in the application of doses of 15 mg , 30 mg and 45 mg . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the tri@@ ple@@ gic study , the effect of the additional administration of acet@@ in and sul@@ fon@@ yl resin showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values by 0.@@ 94 % while the additional administration of placebo resulted in a decrease of 0.@@ 35 % . &quot;
&quot; in a small study in which the combination of Ac@@ tos and insulin was examined in 28@@ 9 patients , the patients receiving Ac@@ tos additionally showed a reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c values of 0.@@ 69 % after 6 months compared to 0.@@ 14 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects associated with Ac@@ tos were visual disturbances , upper respiratory tract infections ( col@@ ds ) , weight gain and hypo@@ der@@ esia ( reduced sensitivity to stimul@@ i ) . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tos may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or one of the other components , nor in patients with liver problems , con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ( high ket@@ one level - in the blood ) . &quot;
&quot; it has been decided that Ac@@ tos should serve as an alternative to standard treatment with met@@ form@@ in in patients , where met@@ form@@ in is not indicated . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to Tak@@ eda Europe R &amp; D Centre Limited for the promotion of Ac@@ tos in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablets are white to whi@@ tish , round , curved and wear on one side the marking &quot; 15 &quot; and on the other side the inscription &quot; Ac@@ tos . &quot; &quot;
&quot; pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is also indicated for the combination with insulin in patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , whose blood sugar is inadequate with insulin and where met@@ form@@ in is un@@ suitable for contra@@ indications or intoler@@ ance ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; for the use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 18 years of age , no data is available , so the application in this age group is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from at least one risk factor ( e.g. earlier cardiac inf@@ ar@@ ction or symptom@@ atic cor@@ on@@ ary heart disease ) , the doctor should start treatment with the lowest available dose and gradually increase the dose . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain or o@@ ede@@ ma , especially those with reduced cardiac reserve . &quot;
&quot; patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure , weight gain and ede@@ ma when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is used in combination with insulin . &quot;
a cardiovascular Out@@ come study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under 75 years with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and pre @-@ existing advanced mak@@ eup was performed .
&quot; this study showed an increase in the report on heart failure , which however did not lead to an increase in mortality in the study . &quot;
in patients with increased output liver cells ( AL@@ T &gt; 2.5 x upper limit of the normal range ) or with other signs of liver disease pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one may not be used .
&quot; if AL@@ T levels are increased up to 3 @-@ fold the upper limit of the normal range , the liver enzyme values are to be controlled as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; if a patient develops symptoms indicating a h@@ ep@@ atic dysfunction , such as un@@ explained nausea , vom@@ iting , over@@ growth disorders , fatigue , loss of appetite and / or dark urine , the liver enzyme values must be checked . &quot;
&quot; the decision , whether the treatment of the patient with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is continued , should be conducted by clinical assessment until preliminary laboratory parameters . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , a dose @-@ dependent weight gain was detected , which can be derived from fatty deposits and in some cases linked to fluid retention . &quot;
&quot; as a result of hem@@ odi@@ lution , a minor reduction in the mean hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in values ( relative reduction by 4 % ) and hem@@ ato@@ cr@@ r@@ its ( relative reduction by 4.1 % ) occurred under therapy with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one . &quot;
similar changes were observed in comparative controlled trials with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in patients under met@@ form@@ in ( relative reduction of ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 3 @-@ 4 % and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 2 % and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in by 1 @-@ 3.2 % ) .
&quot; as a result of increased insulin sensitivity , patients who receive pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one as oral tw@@ o- or triple combination therapy with insulin , or as a two @-@ time combination therapy with insulin , have the risk of dose @-@ dependent hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; after the market launch was reported under treatment with thi@@ az@@ ol@@ d@@ indi@@ a , including pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , an appearance or worsen@@ ing of diabe@@ tic mac@@ ular ede@@ ma with a reduction in visual acuity . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear whether there is a direct correlation between the intake of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and the appearance of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma , but regulatory doctors should be aware of the possibility of mac@@ ular ede@@ ma when patients report disorders of visual acuity ; a suitable ophthalm@@ ological clari@@ fication should be considered . &quot;
&quot; in a summary analysis of reports of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one &quot;
&quot; the calculated questionnaire was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ cam@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a study of 3.5 years for the study of cardiovascular events , Fra@@ c@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ; 1.0 Fra@@ c@@ tures per 100 patient years ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ cam@@ ent . &quot;
patients should be aware of the possibility of pregnancy and if a patient wants pregnancy or this occurs the treatment is dep@@ rec@@ ated ( see section 4.6 ) .
&quot; studies investigating the interactions have shown that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not exercise any relevant effects on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
&quot; interactions with pharmaceuticals that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by these enzymes , e.g. oral contrac@@ ep@@ tives , cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , calcium channel blo@@ cker and H@@ M@@ G@@ Co@@ A reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors are not expected . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 inhibit@@ or ) resulted in an increase in the AU@@ C of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one by 3 @-@ fold .
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 @-@ induc@@ tor ) resulted in a 54 % lowering of the AU@@ C from pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one .
this is because treatment with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces the Hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia resulting in pregnancy and increases the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
&quot; very common &gt; 1 / 10 ; often &gt; 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; occasionally &gt; 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ; very rare &gt; 1 / 10@@ 000 , individual cases : unknown ( from this data is not estim@@ able ) . &quot;
these lead to a temporary change in the tur@@ g@@ or and index of the lens as observed in other hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic agents .
&quot; in clinical trials with Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one AL@@ T @-@ An@@ sti@@ ege on the three @-@ fold of the upper limit of the normal range often oc@@ cured as often as placebo , but more rarely than in comparison groups under met@@ form@@ in or sul@@ fon@@ yl resin . &quot;
&quot; in an Out@@ come study in patients with advanced Mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease , the incidence of severe heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on was 1.6 % higher than placebo , if Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one bz@@ w . &quot;
&quot; since the market launch , it is rarely reported about heart failure under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , but more often when pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was used in combination with insulin or in patients with heart failure in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; a summary analysis of adverse events concerning frac@@ tures from random@@ ised , controlled , double @-@ blind clinical trials over a period of up to 3.5 years with more than 8,@@ 100 patients in the groups treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was carried out in the groups treated with comparative medi@@ c@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study conducted over a period of 3.5 years , Fra@@ c@@ tures performed at 44 / 8@@ 70 ( 5.1 % ) of patients treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one compared to 23 / 9@@ 05 ( 2.5 % ) in patients treated with a comparative medi@@ cam@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; when taking the reported maximum dose of 120 mg / day over four days , then 180 mg / day over seven days no symptoms occurred . &quot;
&quot; Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on appears to be activated via activation of specific nuclear recept@@ ors ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) activated receptor @-@ γ ( P@@ PA@@ R @-@ γ ) , leading to increased insulin sensitivity of liver , fat and skel@@ etal muscle cells . &quot;
it could be shown that pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduces glucose production in the liver and increases the peripheral glu@@ cos@@ ever@@ sion in the case of insulin resistance .
a clinical study with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on versus G@@ lic@@ lac@@ tic as mon@@ otherapy was continued for two years to study the time until the therapeutic effect was removed ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ≥ 8.@@ 0 % after the first 6 months of treatment ) .
&quot; at the time of two years after the onset of the therapy , a blood sugar control ( defined as H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c &lt; 8,0 % ) was maintained by pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in 69 % of the treated patients ( compared to 50 % of the patients under G@@ lic@@ la@@ dium ) . &quot;
&quot; in a placebo @-@ controlled study of 12 months , patients whose blood sugar was insufficient with insulin despite three months of optimisation was random@@ ized to pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo . &quot;
&quot; in patients under pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , the mean H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c was reduced by 0.@@ 45 % compared to the patients who continued to receive insulin ; a reduction in insulin dose in the group treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one was observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for a year , a statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; the effect of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( mon@@ otherapy with 45 mg versus placebo ) was tested in a small , 18 @-@ week study of type 2 diabetes patients . &quot;
&quot; in most clinical trials compared to placebo , a reduction in total plasma tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids and a rise in HD@@ L cholesterol as well as neg@@ li@@ gible but clin@@ ically not significantly increased LD@@ L cholesterol levels were observed . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials over a period of up to two years , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one reduced total plas@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and free fatty acids compared to placebo , met@@ form@@ in or G@@ lic@@ la@@ dium and increased HD@@ L cholesterol levels . &quot;
&quot; compared to placebo , no statisti@@ cally significant increase in LD@@ L cholesterol was observed in pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , while values decreased among met@@ form@@ in and G@@ lic@@ lac@@ cia . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the in@@ timi@@ dation tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial hei@@ gh@@ tened tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;
&quot; in the Pro@@ Active study , a cardiovascular outcome study , 52@@ 38 patients with type 2 diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus and advanced Mac@@ rov@@ ascular disease were random@@ ized in groups receiving either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or placebo for a period of up to 3.5 years . &quot;
&quot; after oral application , pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on is absorbed quickly , whereby the peak concentrations of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in plasma can usually be achieved 2 hours after application . &quot;
&quot; on this basis , the contribution of M @-@ IV to efficacy in about three times the efficacy of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one , whereas the relative efficacy of M @-@ II is minimal . &quot;
&quot; in interaction studies , it has been proven that Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on does not affect pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics or pharmac@@ o@@ dynamics of di@@ go@@ x@@ in , war@@ far@@ in , phen@@ proc@@ ou@@ mon and met@@ form@@ in . &quot;
the simultaneous use of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one with gem@@ fibro@@ zi@@ l ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 In@@ hibit@@ or ) or with Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ( a cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 2@@ C@@ 8 induc@@ tor ) or lowers the plasma concentration of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; according to oral application of radio@@ activity marked pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one in humans , the marker was found mainly in rot@@ ting ( 55 % ) and to a lesser extent in the urine ( 45 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the mean plasma @-@ elimination rate of imm@@ utable pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one is 5 @-@ 6 hours in humans , and the total active metabol@@ ites are 16 - 23 hours . &quot;
&quot; the plasma concentrations of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and its metabol@@ ites are lower in patients with reduced kidney function than in healthy subjects , but the rates of the oral clear@@ ance of the mother &apos;s substance are similar . &quot;

this is due to the reduction of Hyper@@ insul@@ in@@ emia and increased insulin resistance of the mother animal under the treatment of pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one which reduces the availability of metabolic substrates for fet@@ al growth .
in long @-@ term studies ( up to 2 years ) increased incidence of hyper@@ pla@@ sia ( in male and female rats ) and tumours ( in male rats ) of the ur@@ inary bladder epitheli@@ um were induced .

&quot; the calculated questionnaire was 1,@@ 9 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in the women treated with pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one and 1.1 frac@@ tures per 100 patient years in women treated with a comparative medi@@ cam@@ ent . &quot;

&quot; in another study over two years , the effects of a combination therapy of met@@ form@@ in with either pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ one or G@@ lic@@ la@@ dium were examined . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials for 1 year , statisti@@ cally significant decrease in alb@@ um@@ in / cre@@ at@@ in@@ in quot@@ i@@ ents was statisti@@ cally significant compared to the bas@@ eline values . &quot;
&quot; in a study of 20 weeks , Pi@@ o@@ gl@@ it@@ az@@ on reduced not only the in@@ timi@@ dation tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des , but also improved the post@@ pran@@ dial hei@@ gh@@ tened tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de levels , this has an effect on tr@@ y@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ de absorption and h@@ ep@@ atic tr@@ y@@ g@@ liz@@ eri@@ de synthesis . &quot;

&quot; Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane has been studied in 29@@ 4 patients with type 1 diabetes , where the pancre@@ as cannot produce insulin , and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively . &quot;
&quot; in the study , the concentration of a substance ( gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) was measured after 12 weeks , indicating how well the blood sugar is set . &quot;
&quot; Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane led to a decrease in the H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c mirror , indicating that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced as with another human insulin . &quot;
Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane should not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , the doses of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane may be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar ( the complete list is to be found in the package contents ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane out@@ weigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes .
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tro@@ ph@@ ane in the entire European Union . &quot;
pre @-@ mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice daily when a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect .
the injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose was inj@@ ected .
&quot; for example , patients whose blood sugar adjustment has improved significantly by an intensive insulin therapy , can change the hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly . &quot;
&quot; any change regarding strength , brand ( manufacturer ) , insulin type ( fast acting , bi@@ pha@@ sic , long @-@ acting insulin , etc . ) , type of insulin ( animal insulin , insulin insulin , insulin analog ) and / or production method ( by re@@ combin@@ ant DNA towards insulin in animal origin ) can cause a change in dosage . &quot;
&quot; if a dose @-@ adjustment is necessary in the case of change to acet@@ oni@@ um in the patient , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over . &quot;
some patients with hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin .
&quot; when travelling over several time zones , the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the doctor must take into account the possible interactions with the therapy and his patients always ask for other medicines taken by them . &quot;

&quot; however , hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can develop gradually : • Light hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sug@@ ary foods . &quot;
&quot; diabe@@ tics should therefore always have grape picking , sweets , bis@@ cuits or sug@@ ary fruit juice . • Seri@@ ous hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias associated with un@@ consciousness are treated with an in@@ tra @-@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1.0 mg ) or by glucose which is given intraven@@ ously by the doctor . &quot;
&quot; the effect begins within half an hour , the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the whole active duration amounts to 24 hours . &quot;

Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive to insulin ( r@@ DNA ) or any of the other components .
&quot; in addition , acet@@ p@@ id can possibly be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that can affect blood sugar . &quot;
&quot; in October 2002 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Nov@@ o Nor@@ disk A / S for the transport of Ac@@ tro@@ p@@ id in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; when two types of insulin are mixed , the amount of insulin quickly involved must first be raised , then the amount of insulin acting . &quot;
&quot; 3 If a dose @-@ adjustment is required in the patient when changing to acet@@ one , it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the change@@ over . &quot;

&quot; Aden@@ ur@@ ic is used in patients who already show signs of crystal de@@ br@@ is , including arthritis ( pain and inflammation in the joints ) or top marks ( &quot; &quot; stones &quot; &quot; i.e. larger amounts of ur@@ anium , which can lead to joint and bone damage ) . &quot;
&quot; if the ur@@ ic acid level is still more than 6 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter after two to four weeks , the dose can be increased to 120 mg once a day . &quot;
&quot; during the first months of treatment , g@@ out attacks can still occur ; therefore , it is recommended that patients use Aden@@ ur@@ ic at least for the first six months to prevent g@@ out attacks . &quot;
the medicine is not recommended in children and in patients who had an organ transplan@@ t as it was not studied for these groups .
&quot; in the first study , which took part in 1 0@@ 72 patients , the efficacy of three different aden@@ ur@@ ic dos@@ ages ( once daily 80 , 120 and 240 mg ) was compared with either a placebo ( placebo ) and al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( another medicine for the treatment of hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia ) . &quot;
&quot; in the second study , two dos@@ ages of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( once daily 80 and 120 mg ) were compared to 7@@ 62 patients each year with al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol was administered in a dose of once daily 300 mg ; patients with kidney problems received only 100 mg per day . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients whose ur@@ ic acid levels were below 6 mg / dl during the last three measurements .
&quot; in the first study 48 % ( 126 of 26@@ 2 ) of patients receiving aden@@ ur@@ ic at a dose of once daily 80 mg , and 65 % ( 175 out of 26@@ 9 ) of patients who once daily intake 120 mg daily , had a urine acid level in the blood of less than 6 mg / dl . &quot;
&quot; compared to this , this was 22 % ( 60 of 26@@ 8 ) of patients suffering from al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol and in none of the 134 patients under placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of Aden@@ ur@@ ic ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include headache , diar@@ rhe@@ a , nausea ( nausea , rash and abnormal liver values ) . &quot;
&quot; especially in patients with cardiac problems in pre@@ history , there may be an increased risk of certain side effects that affect the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Aden@@ ur@@ ic was more effective in reducing the ur@@ ic acid levels in the blood than al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol , but also a higher risk of side effects associated with the heart and blood vessels . &quot;
treatment of chronic hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ a@@ emia in diseases that have already led to ur@@ inary deposits ( including an illness known or currently known as disease node and / or arthritis ) .
&quot; if serum res@@ ins are still &gt; 6 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) after 2 @-@ 4 weeks , a dose increase can be taken into consideration at AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 times a day . &quot;
&quot; for patients with severe kidney function , efficacy and safety have not been fully investigated so far ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ ine Clear@@ ance &lt; 30 ml / min , see Section 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; since there are no experiences in children and adolescents , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients . &quot;
&quot; organ transplan@@ t recipients since there are no experiences in organ transplan@@ t recipients , the use of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended in this group of patients ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
cardiovascular diseases In patients with isch@@ a@@ em@@ ic heart disease or de@@ compensated heart failure the treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is not recommended ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as with other hard @-@ acid @-@ causing drugs , it can occur during the treatment phase to an acute g@@ out attack , because of the reduction in serum res@@ ins acid deposits can first be mobil@@ ised in the tissue . &quot;
&quot; for example , in malign@@ ant diseases and their treatment , Les@@ ch@@ - Ny@@ han syndrome ) , the absolute concentration of X@@ an@@ thin in urine in rare cases is so widespread that it can be deposited in the ur@@ inary tract . &quot;
&quot; during the Phase 3 clinical trials , mild ab@@ norm@@ alities of the liver function were observed ( 3.5 % ) in patients treated with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at . &quot;
it is therefore recommended to perform a liver function test before the beginning of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ ure treatment and in the further course depending on clinical findings ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; The@@ ophy@@ ll@@ in Z@@ was no interaction studies conducted at F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , but it is known that the X@@ O inhibit@@ or can lead to an increase in the the@@ ophy@@ l@@ line mirror ( a blocking of the metabol@@ isation of the@@ ophy@@ ll@@ ine was also reported for other X@@ O inhibit@@ ors ) . &quot;
&quot; in subjects the simultaneous administration of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and nap@@ ro@@ xen was associated with an increase in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ uses ( C@@ MA@@ x 28 % , AU@@ C 41 % and t@@ 1 / 2 26 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , the use of nap@@ ro@@ xen or other N@@ SA@@ R / Co@@ x @-@ 2 inhibit@@ ors was not associated with clin@@ ically significant increase in adverse events . &quot;
Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in / In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in / Hydro@@ chl@@ oric acid / War@@ far@@ in F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at can be used together with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in or In@@ dom@@ et@@ ac@@ in without a dose adjustment for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or the simultaneously applied other active ingredient .
&quot; in a study with subjects 120 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 1 x daily showed a mean 22 % increase in the AU@@ C of Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 substrate , which indicates a possible weak inhibit@@ ory effect of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 enzyme in vi@@ vo . &quot;
&quot; An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da It could be shown that the simultaneous intake of an ant@@ acids that contains magnesium hydro@@ xi@@ de and aluminum hydro@@ xi@@ de , the absorption of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( around 1 hour ) delays and a decline in the C@@ MA@@ x by 32 % , but no significant change in the AU@@ C . &quot;
pregnancy data on a very limited number of exposed pregn@@ ancies do not include side effects of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at on pregnancy or the health of the fet@@ us / new@@ born .
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development or birth ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients should be cau@@ tious when controlling a vehicle , operating machines or performing hazardous activities until they can reasonably be certain that AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C does not adver@@ sely affect their performance . &quot;
&quot; a numer@@ ically higher incidence of the cardiovascular events reported by the investig@@ ator was observed in the overall study group in the pi@@ vot@@ al study of Phase 3 ( 1.3 versus 0.3 occur@@ ren@@ ces per 100 patient years ) , although no statisti@@ cally significant differences were found and no caus@@ al relationship with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at could be detected . &quot;
the risk factors identified in these patients were an arter@@ ios@@ kl@@ erotic condition and / or a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction or a de@@ compensated heart failure in the medical history .
&quot; common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) , occasional ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) and rare ( ≥ 1 / 1000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) adverse events , which could occur in the treatment groups with 80 mg / 120 mg of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and which were reported in all F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once , are listed below . &quot;
&quot; diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies , severe cut@@ aneous r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;
the events related to long @-@ term extension studies were similar to those reported in Phase 3 studies ( see Table 1 ) .
&quot; the following treatment @-@ related events were reported in all of the F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at treatment groups more than once and occurred in patients receiving F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg in long @-@ term extension studies ( up to 4 years with an exposure time of &gt; 1,@@ 900 patient years ) , according to the indications occasionally . &quot;
the following treatment @-@ related events were either not reported at all or reported in the pi@@ vot@@ al studies of the Phase 3 pi@@ vot@@ al studies :
&quot; diabetes , hyper@@ lip@@ ide@@ mia , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hyp@@ ot@@ ra@@ th@@ esia , show@@ y EC@@ G , c@@ ough , short@@ ness of skin , skin les@@ ions , rash dysfunction , increase of TS@@ H concentration in blood , decrease in lymp@@ ho@@ cy@@ te number , decrease in the number of white blood cells . &quot;
mechanism of action ur@@ ic acid is the final product of the pur@@ ine metabolism in humans and is produced as part of the reaction as@@ k@@ ade hypo@@ x@@ an@@ thin → X@@ an@@ thin → ur@@ ic acid .
&quot; F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is a potent , non @-@ pur@@ ine @-@ selective inhibit@@ or of the X@@ O ( NP @-@ SI@@ x@@ O ) inhibit@@ or with a K@@ i value for the in vitro fer@@ til@@ isation below the nan@@ om@@ ol@@ ar range . &quot;
&quot; clinical trial results The efficacy of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C was shown in two pi@@ vot@@ al studies of Phase 3 ( AP@@ EX study and F@@ ACT study as described below ) , which were conducted with 1,@@ 8@@ 32 patients with hyper@@ ur@@ ic@@ emia and g@@ out . &quot;
the primary efficacy end@@ point in each study was the proportion of patients in which the last three month specific serum res@@ ins were &lt; 6.0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; placebo ( n = 134 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily ( n = 26@@ 7 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) , AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 240 mg 1 x daily ( n = 25@@ 8 ) for patients with a serum cre@@ atine value to study start of &gt; 1,5 mg / dl and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl . &quot;
the AP@@ EX study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the treatment with conven@@ tionally used doses al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg ( n = 25@@ 8 ) / 100 mg ( n = 10 ) .
the F@@ ACT study showed the statisti@@ cally significant superi@@ ority of both the treatment with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 80 mg 1 x daily and with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C 120 mg 1 x daily compared to the usual recommended dose of Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg .
patients with serum cre@@ atine values &gt; 1.5 and ≤ 2.0 mg / dl ) or 300 mg 1 x daily ( n = 50@@ 9 ) were combined for the analyses . * p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus Al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol # p &lt; 0.@@ 001 versus 80 mg
&quot; serum res@@ ins were reduced to &lt; 6,@@ 0 mg / dl ( 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) during the visit of the doctor in week 2 and sustained throughout the entire treatment . &quot;
50@@ 9 patients received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol 300 mg 1 x daily ; 10 patients with serum content &gt; 1.5 and &lt; 2.0 mg / dl received 100 mg 1 x daily .
the primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with kidney function impair@@ ment The AP@@ EX study evaluated the efficacy in 40 patients with ren@@ al dysfunction ( i.e. ) .
&quot; with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the primary efficacy end@@ point was 44 % ( 80 mg 1 x daily ) , 45 % ( 120 mg 1 x daily ) and 60 % ( 240 mg 1 x daily ) of patients achieved . &quot;
&quot; there were no clin@@ ically significant differences in the percentage of the serum res@@ ic acid concentrations in subjects , despite their kidney function ( 58 % in the group with normal ren@@ al function and 55 % in the group with severe kidney function disorders ) . &quot;
primary end@@ point in the sub@@ group of patients with serum res@@ ic acid concentrations ≥ 10 mg / dl of E@@ tw@@ a 40 % of patients ( bas@@ eline ) had a serum concentration of ≥ 10 mg / dl .
&quot; the data from the open extension study of Phase 3 , collected in two years showed that the persistent reduction in serum res@@ ins was reduced to &lt; 6 mg / dl ( &lt; 3@@ 57 µ@@ mo@@ l / l ) , so that less than 3 % of patients in the months required 16 @-@ 24 ( i.e. more than 97 % of patients did not need treatment against a surge ) . &quot;
&quot; this was associated with a reduction in the height of the g@@ out node , which resulted in 54 % of the patients a complete disappearance of the gi@@ gging no@@ des up to 24 months . &quot;
increased T@@ SH@@ - values ( &gt; 5.5 µ@@ IE / ml ) were observed in patients receiving long @-@ term treatment with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 5.@@ 0 % ) and also in patients who received al@@ lo@@ pur@@ in@@ ol ( 5.@@ 8 % ) in the open long@@ term extension studies ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in healthy subjects , the maximum plasma concentrations ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the plasma concentration time curve ( AU@@ C ) increased from F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at to dose of simple and multiple doses of 10 mg to 120 mg dose propor@@ tionally . &quot;
&quot; for doses between 120 mg and 300 mg , an increase in AU@@ C is observed for F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at which is greater than the dose @-@ proportional increase . &quot;
&quot; after taking simple or multiple oral doses of 80 to 120 mg 1 x daily , the C@@ MA@@ x amounts to about 2.8 @-@ 3.2 µ@@ g / ml and 5,@@ 0 @-@ 5,@@ 3 µ@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; however , no clin@@ ically significant change in the percentage of serum res@@ ins was observed , provided this was tested ( multiple doses of 80 mg ) . &quot;
distribution The apparent Ste@@ ady state distribution volume ( V@@ ss / F ) of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at is between 29 and 75 l after intake of doses of 10 @-@ 300 mg .
F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at &apos;s plasma @-@ binding binding amounts to approximately 9@@ 9.@@ 2 % ( primary binding to alb@@ um@@ in ) and is constant over the concentration width achieved with doses of 80 and 120 mg .
&quot; in vitro studies in human liver micro@@ som@@ s , these oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites are mainly formed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A1 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 or C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 9 , and that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ o@@ stat@@ glu@@ cur@@ on@@ id is mainly produced by U@@ GT 1@@ A1 , 1@@ A@@ 8 and 1@@ A@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; after intake of a 80 mg dose of 14@@ C @-@ marked F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at , approximately 49 % of the dose in the urine was found to be unchanged F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 3 % ) , the known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 13 % ) and further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to ex@@ cre@@ tion over the urine , approximately 45 % of the dose in the chair was found as un@@ altered F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at ( 12 % ) , the well @-@ known oxid@@ ative metabol@@ ites and their con@@ ju@@ gate ( 25 % ) and further unknown metabol@@ ites ( 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; after taking multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild , moderate or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency , the C@@ MA@@ x of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at did not change in proportion to subjects with normal ren@@ al function . &quot;
the mean total @-@ AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at increased by about 1.8 times from 7.5 μ y Q@@ t / ml in the group with normal ren@@ al function to 13.@@ 2 μ y w@@ m / ml in the group with severe kidney function .
&quot; 12 liver function restriction After intake of multiple doses of 80 mg AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in patients with mild ( chil@@ d. pu@@ gh classification A ) or moderate ( child @-@ Pu@@ gh classification B ) liver function restriction , the C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at and its metabol@@ ites did not significantly change compared to subjects with normal liver function . &quot;
no significant changes have been observed with regard to the AU@@ C of F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or its metabol@@ ites after taking multiple oral doses of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C in older patients compared to younger subjects .
&quot; carcin@@ ogen@@ esis , mut@@ agen@@ esis , impair@@ ment of fertility In male rats was found a statisti@@ cally significant increase in bladder tum@@ ors ( transition cell pap@@ ill@@ omas and carcin@@ omas ) only in connection with X@@ an@@ thin stones in the highly dos@@ ed treated group , at about 11 times the exposure to humans . &quot;
these findings are seen as a result of a specific pur@@ ine metabolism and urine composition and considered not relevant for clinical application .
it was found that F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at in oral doses of up to 48 mg / kg / day has no effect on fertility and reproductive capacity of male and female rats .
&quot; in high doses , which were about 3 times the human therapeutic exposure , mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity occurred , accompanied by a reduction in the Auf@@ zu@@ cht@@ zeit and a develop@@ mental retard@@ ation in the offspring of rats . &quot;
&quot; ter@@ at@@ ological studies in carrying rats with ex@@ positions , which were about 4.3 @-@ fold and in carrying rab@@ bits with ex@@ positions , which were about the 13 @-@ fold of the human therapeutic exposure , did not yiel@@ ded any ter@@ ato@@ genic effects . &quot;

&quot; diar@@ rho@@ ea , nausea and vom@@ iting are more common in patients treated with Col@@ ch@@ ic@@ in . * * In clinical studies , severe cut@@ aneous r@@ ashes or severe hyper@@ sensitivity reactions were observed . &quot;
&quot; in the open long @-@ term extension studies 9@@ 06 patients were treated up to 1 year long , 3@@ 22 patients up to 2 years long , 57 patients up to 3 years long and 53 patients up to 4 years with F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at 80 mg / 120 mg . &quot;

&quot; the owner of the authorisation for the transport system has to ensure that a pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system , as described in version 2.0 module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application , is ready before the medicine is put into circulation , and as long as the medicine is brought into circulation . &quot;
an updated R@@ MP is to be submitted according to the CH@@ MP Gui@@ deline for Human Use Risk Management Systems with the next Peri@@ odi@@ c Safety Update Report ( P@@ SU@@ R ) .
&quot; in addition , an update of the R@@ MP is required • when new information is available , which have an impact on safety data , pharmac@@ o@@ glob@@ es plan or risk minim@@ isation activities • within 60 days of reaching important mil@@ estones ( pharmaceutical incub@@ ation or risk minim@@ isation ) • on request of the E@@ MEA &quot;
&quot; in some people , ur@@ ic acid accum@@ ulates in the blood and can reach concentrations that are so high that ur@@ ic acid becomes in@@ soluble . &quot;
&quot; if you keep the ur@@ ic acid concentration low by the 1 x daily intake of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C , the cryst@@ alli@@ zation will be prevented and in this way a reduction of the discomfort can be achieved . &quot;
AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C may not be taken if you are hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredient F@@ ebu@@ x@@ ost@@ at or any of the other constitu@@ ents of AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C .

&quot; if at the moment you have an attack ( sudden onset of severe pain , pressure sensitivity , redness , heat feeling and joint swelling ) , wait until the g@@ out attack is cleared before starting with AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
&quot; this does not have to be with everyone , but could also occur with you , especially during the first weeks of treatment or - months , if you are taking AD@@ EN@@ U@@ RI@@ C . &quot;
your doctor will prescri@@ be other medicines to help prevent g@@ out attacks or to treat the associated symptoms ( such as pain and joint swelling ) .

AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is used to treat o@@ steopor@@ osis ( a disease where the bones are br@@ ittle ) in women after menop@@ ause where there is a risk of low vitamin D levels .
&quot; the patient must take the tablet with a full glass of water ( no mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before eating , drinking or taking other medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to avoid irrit@@ ation of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , the patient may not lie down until after the first food intake of the day , which should take place at the earliest 30 minutes after taking the tablet . &quot;
&quot; since Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate and vitamin D@@ 3 are already used separately in pharmaceuticals , approved in the European Union , the company presented data obtained from previous studies and published literature . &quot;
the company also conducted a study of 35 men and 6@@ 82 post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women with o@@ steopor@@ osis in order to verify the efficacy of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE in relation to increasing vitamin D levels .
&quot; after a 15 week treatment , the proportion of patients with low vitamin D levels was lower in patients treated with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE ( 11 % ) than those who received al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate alone ( 32 % ) . &quot;
the company also presented data that stated that the al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate dose included in AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is exactly the dose required to prevent bone loss .
&quot; the most common side effects ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) include headache , pain of the mus@@ cul@@ os@@ kel@@ etal system ( muscles , bones or joints ) and symptoms of the digestive system such as abdominal pain , dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia ( flat@@ ul@@ ence ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , diar@@ rho@@ ea ( blo@@ ated stomach ) , triggered abdom@@ en ( blo@@ ated abdom@@ en ) as well as acid lifts . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should not be used in patients with hyper@@ sensitivity ( allergy ) against al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate , vitamin D@@ 3 or any of the other constitu@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; it must not be used in the case of diseases of the o@@ es@@ op@@ hag@@ us , in patients with hypo@@ cal@@ c@@ emia ( low calcium levels ) or in patients who cannot stand or sit for at least 30 minutes . &quot;
&quot; in January 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Mer@@ ck Shar@@ p &amp; Doh@@ a Ltd . a permit for the transport of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; cap@@ s@@ ular white to broken white tablets , marked with the outline of a bone on one side and &quot; 7@@ 10 &quot; on the other side . &quot;
&quot; AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is only available with water ( not with mineral water ) at least 30 minutes before the first meal , drink or intake of medicines ( including ant@@ acids , calcium and vitamin supplements ) for the day . &quot;
follow these instructions carefully to reduce the risk of es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation and associated side effects ( see section 4.4 ) :
&quot; • AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE should be swal@@ lowed only with a full glass of water ( at least 200 ml ) after the day . • The patients should not ch@@ ew the tablet or leave the tablet in the mouth , as there is a risk for or@@ op@@ har@@ yn@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a . &quot;
&quot; B. pep@@ tic ul@@ cer , active gastro@@ intestinal bleeding or surgical procedures in the upper gastro@@ intestinal tract , except P@@ yl@@ or@@ op@@ last@@ y , can only be given with special caution ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al reactions , such as es@@ op@@ ha@@ gi@@ tis , es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al ul@@ cer@@ a and es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al erosion , rarely followed by es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al strips , were reported in patients under the intake of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( sometimes these were severe and required hosp@@ itali@@ zation ) . &quot;
&quot; the doctor should therefore draw attention to all signs and symptoms that indicate possible es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al responses , and patients should be advised to stop the medicine at the onset of symptoms of menop@@ ause , such as dy@@ sp@@ ha@@ gia , pain in swal@@ lowing or retro@@ star@@ ving heart@@ burn , and seek medical advice ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; 3 The risk of severe es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al side effects seems to be elevated in patients who do not take the medicine correctly and / or , after the onset of symptoms , which point to an es@@ op@@ ha@@ ge@@ al irrit@@ ation . &quot;
it is very important that all dosing instructions can be passed on to the patient and be understood by the patient ( see section 4.2 ) .
&quot; while in large @-@ scale clinical trials with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate no increased risk was detected , there were rare ( after market introduction ) ga@@ stri@@ c and du@@ o@@ den@@ al@@ ul@@ cer@@ a , including some serious and with complications , reported ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw , usually associated with tooth extraction and / or a local infection ( including o@@ ste@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis ) , has been reported in cancer patients whose therapy regi@@ men mainly contains intraven@@ ously administered bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; there are no data available to indicate whether stopping a bis@@ phosph@@ on@@ ate therapy in patients who need a max@@ illary surgical procedure , reduces the risk of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose of the jaw . &quot;
the clinical assessment by the attending physician is decisive for treatment planning in each patient based on an individual benefit @-@ risk assessment .
patients should be instructed to use AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE to take the tablet next morning after taking a dose of AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE after they have noticed their failure .
&quot; you should not take two tablets the same day , but take the intake of one tablet per week as originally planned on the planned week of the week . &quot;
other diseases affecting the metabolism ( such as vitamin D deficiency and hyp@@ op@@ ar@@ ath@@ y@@ re@@ oi@@ dis@@ m ) should also be treated appropriately prior to therapy with AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE .
&quot; al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate foods and drinks ( including mineral water ) , calcium supplements , ant@@ acids and some oral medicines may affect the resor@@ ption of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate if taken at the same time . &quot;
&quot; therefore , after taking Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at , patients must wait at least 30 minutes before taking other medicines ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 5.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although specific interaction studies were not carried out , al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was used in clinical trials together with a variety of commonly prescribed drugs , without clin@@ ically relevant interactions . &quot;
AD@@ RO@@ V@@ AN@@ CE is intended for post @-@ menop@@ aus@@ al women only and is therefore not applicable during pregnancy or by breast@@ feeding women .
animal studies with al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate do not indicate directly damaging effects with regard to pregnancy that recognize embry@@ onic / fet@@ al or post@@ nat@@ al development .

the effects of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate on bone mass and frac@@ ture incidence in post@@ menop@@ aus@@ al women were examined in two phase III studies of identical design ( n = 9@@ 44 ) and in the Fra@@ k@@ tur intervention study ( F@@ IT : n = 6.@@ 4@@ 59 ) .

&quot; in the two @-@ year extension of these studies , the asc@@ ents of the BM@@ D of spine and tro@@ chan@@ ter continued ; also the BM@@ D of the fem@@ ur and the whole body was maintained . &quot;
&quot; it consisted of two placebo @-@ controlled trials , where al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was taken daily ( 5 mg daily over 2 years and then 10 m@@ g. a day , either over 1 or 2 years ) : &quot;
in this study the daily dose of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate reduced the occurrence of at least one new verteb@@ rate frac@@ ture by 47 % ( Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ at 7.@@ 9 % vs placebo 15.@@ 0 % ) .

&quot; in o@@ steopor@@ osis studies , Al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate was effective if taken at least 30 minutes before the first meal or drink of the day . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects , oral pre@@ d@@ nis@@ one ( 20 mg three times a day over five days ) led to no clin@@ ically significant change in the oral bio@@ availability of al@@ en@@ dr@@ on@@ ate ( increase in the range from 20 % to 44 % ) . &quot;

&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft are already in use in the EU , the company presented the results of previously conducted studies with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft and data from published literature . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results of a clinical trial on 6@@ 68 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation were presented , whereby the application of Adv@@ agra@@ f was compared with Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the number of patients with which the transplan@@ t was rep@@ elled after a treatment period of one year ( by examining how often a renewed organ transplan@@ t or a resum@@ ption of di@@ aly@@ sis was necessary ) .
&quot; in addition , shorter further studies have been carried out in 119 patients with kidney transplan@@ tation and 129 patients with liver transplan@@ tation and examined how adv@@ agra@@ f is absorbed by the body in comparison to Pro@@ gra@@ f / Pro@@ gra@@ ft . &quot;

only physicians who are familiar with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy and treatment of transplan@@ t patients should prescri@@ be this medicine or make changes in immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy .
&quot; due to clin@@ ically relevant differences in the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , this can lead to gra@@ ft rejection or increased incidence of side effects , including under@@ - or super@@ immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and the corresponding daily dose ; provision of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see sections 4.4 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as a result of switching to an alternative formulation , a therapeutic drug monitoring and corresponding dose adap@@ tations must be carried out to ensure that the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus remains . &quot;
the dosage of Adv@@ agra@@ f should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rejection and toler@@ ability in individual cases and on blood sample regulations ( see below &quot; Recommen@@ dations
&quot; after adjustment from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f , the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test mirror should be checked before switching and over two weeks after change@@ over . &quot;
&quot; in day 4 , systemic exposure , measured as a level mirror , was comparable to both ni@@ otic and liver transplan@@ ted patients . &quot;
careful and repeated controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test mirror are recommended during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation below Adv@@ agra@@ f to ensure adequate substance exposure in the immediate post transplan@@ tation phase .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is a substance with low clear@@ ance , an adjustment of the dose can take several days until the Ste@@ ady State is reached . &quot;
&quot; if the patient &apos;s condition in the first postoperative period does not allow oral consumption of medicines , the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ Treatment can be initiated intraven@@ ously ( Pro@@ gra@@ f 5 mg / ml concentrate for the production of an in@@ fusion solution ) with a dose of ca . &quot;
&quot; duration of application For suppression of transplan@@ t rejection , immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression must be maintained ; consequently , a maximum duration of oral therapy may not be indicated . &quot;
dosage recommendations - kidney transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive therapy should start with 0.@@ 20 - 0.@@ 30 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
further dose adap@@ tations can later be necessary as the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can change in the course of stabili@@ zation of the patient after the transplan@@ t .
dosage recommendations - liver transplan@@ tation proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection The oral contrac@@ ep@@ tive therapy should start with 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 20 mg / kg / day as a daily gift in the morning .
&quot; dosage recommendation - conversion from Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ f must require a transplan@@ t recipients of twice daily dosage of Pro@@ gra@@ f capsules to a once daily intake of Adv@@ agra@@ f , so this conversion must take place in relation 1 : 1 ( mg : mg ) , relative to the entire daily dose . &quot;
kidney and liver transplan@@ tation After switching from other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants to Adv@@ agra@@ ph once a day the treatment with the oral initial dose recommended in kidney and liver transplan@@ tation has to begin with the proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection .
&quot; in adult patients who are converted to adv@@ agra@@ f , an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day is taken once a day in the morning . &quot;
&quot; other transplan@@ t recipients , although there is no clinical experience with Advanced , pancre@@ atic and color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts , was used in an oral initial dose of 0.@@ 10 - 0.@@ 15 mg / kg / day , for pancre@@ atic transplan@@ ts in an oral initial dose of 0.3 mg / kg / day . &quot;
dose adap@@ tations in special patient groups patients with reduced liver function For the maintenance of blood tal@@ low levels in the targeted area a reduction of the dose may be required in patients with severe liver function disorders .
&quot; patients with reduced kidney function Since the kidney function does not affect the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , it can be assumed that a dose adjustment is not necessary . &quot;
&quot; however , due to the ne@@ phr@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic potential of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , careful monitoring of the ren@@ al function ( including a regular determination of serum cholesterol levels , a calculation of the cre@@ atine and a monitoring of the ur@@ inary volume ) is recommended . &quot;
change@@ over from C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to Adv@@ agra@@ f When converting from a C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in to a tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ based therapy caution is advised ( see sections 4.4 and 4.5 ) .
recommendations to the valley mirror in thorou@@ gh@@ bred The dose should be based primarily on the clinical assessment of rep@@ ul@@ sion and toler@@ ability in individual cases by using full blood Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test mirror controls .
&quot; recommended frequent controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels should also be checked after conversion of Pro@@ gra@@ f to Adv@@ agra@@ ph , dose adjustment , changes of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or while applying substances that could change the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus @-@ blood concentration ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since Adv@@ agra@@ f is a medicine with a low clearance , adjustments of the dose may require several days until the Ste@@ ady State has occurred . &quot;
clinical trials suggest that successful treatment is possible in most cases if the levels in blood do not exceed 20 n@@ g / ml .
&quot; in clinical practice , the valley level of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in full blood in the first time after liver transplan@@ ts is usually in the range of 5 - 20 n@@ g / ml and with kidney and heart transplan@@ ted patients at 10 - 20 n@@ g / ml . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent maintenance therapy of liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients , blood concentrations in the range of 5 - 15 n@@ g / ml were usually used . &quot;
&quot; this has led to serious adverse events , including gra@@ ft rejection or other side effects caused by tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus sub@@ - or over@@ exposure . &quot;
patients should always maintain the same tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus formulation and daily dosage ; provision of the formulation or the regime should only be carried out under close @-@ mes@@ h@@ ed control of a physician experienced in transplan@@ tation ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; 5 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are currently no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; in addition to proph@@ yla@@ xis of transplan@@ t rejection in adult heart transplan@@ t recep@@ tions and transplan@@ t recipients , there are still no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; due to possible interactions , which can lead to a reduction of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mia in the blood and a weak@@ ening of the clinical effect of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , the intake of herbal supplements containing St. John &apos;s wort ( hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) or other herbal remedies should be avoided during treatment with Adv@@ agra@@ f ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with diar@@ rho@@ ea , a particularly careful monitoring of the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus concentrations in the blood is required , since the Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels may be subject to considerable variations in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , a chamber or sep@@ tum hyper@@ tro@@ phy was observed in Pro@@ gra@@ f as a cardi@@ om@@ y@@ opathy , which can therefore also occur under Adv@@ agra@@ ph . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; as with other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , exposure to sunlight or UV light should be limited due to the possible risk of mal@@ ig@@ ner skin changes due to suitable clothing or use of a sun protection agent with a high protection factor . &quot;
&quot; if patients who take Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , show symptoms for PRE@@ S such as head@@ aches , altered state of consciousness , cra@@ mps and visual disturbances , should be a radi@@ ological examination ( e.@@ g . &quot;
&quot; as Adv@@ agra@@ f contains hard capsules , ret@@ ar@@ ded , lac@@ tose , patients with rare her@@ edi@@ tary gal@@ act@@ ose intoler@@ ance , lac@@ t@@ ase deficiency or glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose mal@@ absorption have special caution . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of medicines or herbal remedies known as inhibit@@ ors or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can influence the metabolism of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus and , consequently , increase or lower the blood levels of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is recommended to monitor the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus blood levels at the same time as a dose of substances that can change the C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3A metabolism and adjust the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus dose for maintenance of the same concentrations ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; a strongly distinctive interaction has been associated with an@@ tim@@ y@@ cot@@ ic such as k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole , flu@@ con@@ az@@ ole , I@@ tra@@ con@@ az@@ ole and v@@ ori@@ con@@ az@@ ole as well as with the Mac@@ ro@@ lid antibiotic ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin and HIV prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies showed that the rise in blood levels mainly resulted from the increased oral bio@@ availability of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , caused by inhibit@@ ing the gastro@@ intestinal metabolism . &quot;
&quot; highly dos@@ ed pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one or meth@@ yl@@ pre@@ d@@ nis@@ ol@@ one , as used in acute rejection reactions , can increase or lower the concentration of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the blood . &quot;
tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus on the metabolism of other medicines tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is known as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ or ; therefore the simultaneous use of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus with medicines that are met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can interfere with their metabolism .
&quot; since tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus lowers the clear@@ ance of ster@@ oid contrac@@ ep@@ tive pills and thus increase hormone exposure , it is particularly cau@@ tious when making decisions about contrac@@ ep@@ tive measures . &quot;
the results of animal experiments have shown that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus may reduce the clear@@ ance of pent@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al and phen@@ az@@ one and increase their half @-@ life time .
the results of a small number of studies on transplan@@ t patients do not indicate that under tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus compared to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants there is an increased risk of adverse events with regard to the course and result of pregnancy .
&quot; in uter@@ o exposure , a monitoring of the new@@ born is recommended for potential adverse effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( especially regarding its effect on the kidneys ) . &quot;
&quot; there is the risk of premature birth ( &lt; week 37 ) and a hyper@@ a@@ emia of the new@@ born ( incidence 8 of 111 new@@ bor@@ ns ) , i.e. : &quot;
the side effect profile of immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive drugs can often not be determined precisely because of the underlying disease of the patient and the simultaneous treatment with a variety of other medicines .
&quot; in the following , side effects are reported in descending order : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , ≤ 1 / 100 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( ≤ 1 / 10,000 , ≤ 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;

&quot; infections and par@@ asi@@ tic diseases As is known to other highly effective immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive drugs is often increased in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus , suscep@@ ti@@ bility to infections ( viral , bacterial , my@@ cot@@ ic , proto@@ zo@@ al ) . &quot;
cases of non @-@ virus @-@ associated N@@ eph@@ rop@@ athy and J@@ C virus @-@ associated progressive multi@@ focal leu@@ ko@@ en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( P@@ ML ) were reported in patients under immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression therapy including therapy with Adv@@ agra@@ f .
it was reported on ben@@ ign or malign@@ ant ne@@ oplas@@ ms including EB@@ V@@ - associated lymp@@ ho@@ prolifer@@ ative disorders and skin tum@@ ors associated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus therapy .
&quot; due to its high molecular weight , low water sol@@ ubil@@ ity and high binding to ery@@ thro@@ cytes and plasma rot@@ eins can be assumed that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is not di@@ aly@@ si@@ fiable . &quot;
&quot; the effects of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be medi@@ ated by binding to a cy@@ tos@@ ol@@ ic protein ( F@@ KB@@ P@@ 12 ) , which is responsible for enrich@@ ing the connection in the cell membrane . &quot;
&quot; this leads to a cal@@ ci@@ um @-@ dependent in@@ hibition of sign@@ alling path@@ ways in the T cell , thereby preventing the tran@@ scription of a certain number of lymp@@ ho@@ kin genes . &quot;
&quot; tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus supp@@ resses the activation of T cells and the proliferation of the B cells dependent on T @-@ hel@@ per cells , further the formation of lymp@@ ho@@ cytes ( such as inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 , inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 3 and γ @-@ interfer@@ on ) and the expression of the inter@@ leu@@ kin @-@ 2 receptor . &quot;
12 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2.6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % .
&quot; survival rates after 12 months were 8@@ 9.@@ 2 % for Adv@@ agra@@ f and 9@@ 0.8 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Advanced Arm 25 ( 14 women , 11 men ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f Arm 24 ( 5 women , 19 men ) were killed . &quot;
&quot; kidney transplan@@ tation The efficacy and safety of Adv@@ agra@@ f and Pro@@ gra@@ f was compared , each in combination with My@@ cop@@ hen@@ ol@@ at@@ mo@@ fe@@ til ( MM@@ F ) and cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , in 6@@ 67 de nov@@ o kidney transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; patients &quot; survival rates after 12 months were 9@@ 6.@@ 9 % for Adv@@ ant@@ f and 97@@ ,5 % for Pro@@ gra@@ f ; in the Advanced Arm 10 ( 3 women , 7 men ) and in Pro@@ gra@@ f Arm 8 ( 3 women , 5 men ) were killed . &quot;

&quot; the incidence of therapy prescri@@ p@@ tions after 12 months ( defined as death , gra@@ ft loss , biop@@ sy confirmed acute rejection or lack of follow @-@ up data ) was 14.@@ 0 % in the Pro@@ gra@@ f group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) and 17.@@ 0 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( N = 2@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; the difference in treatment was -@@ 3.0 % ( Adv@@ agra@@ f@@ - C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ) ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 9.@@ 9 % , 4.0 % &#93; ) for Adv@@ ant@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( 9@@ 5.2 % confidence interval &#91; -@@ 8.@@ 9 % , 5.2 % &#93; ) for Pro@@ gra@@ f vs C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in . &quot;

&quot; published results of primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus in the form of twice daily applied pro@@ gra@@ f capsules after other primary organ transplan@@ ts Pro@@ gra@@ f has developed into a recognized primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive medication after pancre@@ atic , lung and intestinal transplan@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; 175 person transplan@@ ted patients , with 4@@ 75 patients who underwent pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation and in 6@@ 30 cases after an intestinal transplan@@ t as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; overall , the safety profile of oral Pro@@ gra@@ f in these published studies correspon@@ ded to the observations in the large studies in which Pro@@ gra@@ f was used for primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression in liver , kidney and heart transplan@@ t recipients . &quot;
&quot; lung transplan@@ tation In an interim analysis of a recently conducted , multi@@ center trial with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f , more than 110 patients were reported to receive either tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in within 1 : 1 random@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; chronic transplan@@ t rejection , bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ al syndrome , was less common in the first year after transplan@@ tation ( 2.@@ 86 % versus 8.@@ 57 % ) . &quot;
&quot; survival rates after one year amounted to 8@@ 0.8 % in tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mia and 83 % in the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in Group ( Tre@@ ede et al . , 3rd IC@@ I San Diego , USA , 2004 ; Abstract 22 ) . &quot;
the patients treated with Tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus were found in 21.@@ 7 % of cases for the genesis of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis of ob@@ liter@@ ans compared to 3@@ 8.@@ 0 % below C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( p = 0.0@@ 25 ) .
&quot; the number of cases in which C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in had to be changed to tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 13 ) , was significantly greater ( p = 0.@@ 02 ) than the number of patients who were switched from tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus to C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 2 ) ( Ke@@ en@@ an et al . , Ann Sa@@ ac@@ ic Sur@@ g 1995 ; 60 : 5@@ 80 ) . &quot;
&quot; the number of cases in which no gra@@ ft rejection occurred was after 6 months ( 5@@ 7.@@ 7 % versus 4@@ 5.@@ 8 % ) and after 1 year ( 50 % versus 3@@ 3.3 % ) and after 1 year ( for@@ ge et al . , J Heart L@@ ung Transplan@@ t 2001 ; 20 : 5@@ 11 ) . &quot;
&quot; in one study , the incidence of the onset of a bron@@ chi@@ o@@ litis was significantly lower in patients treated with tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus . &quot;
pancre@@ atic transplan@@ tation A multi@@ center trial with oral pro@@ gra@@ f was carried out to 205 patients who were treated at the same time a pancre@@ atic and kidney transplan@@ t following a random@@ ized tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( n = 103 ) or C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( n = 102 ) .
the oral initial dose ( per protocol ) of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus was 0.2 mg / kg / day and was then used to achieve the target level of 8 to 15 n@@ g / ml on 5 .
&quot; the published clinical results of a mono@@ centric study with oral Pro@@ gra@@ f as primary immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive after color@@ ect@@ al transplan@@ ts showed an up @-@ to @-@ date survival rate of 75 % after 1 year , 5 % after 5 years and 42 % after 10 years . &quot;
&quot; methods for early detection of Ep@@ stein @-@ Bar@@ r ( EB@@ V ) - and CM@@ V infections , bone mar@@ row aug@@ mentation , supple@@ mental dose of the inter@@ leu@@ kin 2 antagon@@ ists D@@ ac@@ li@@ zumab , lower initial doses of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ zumab and recent transplan@@ t radiation ( Abu @-@ El@@ mag@@ d et al . , Ann Sur@@ g 2001 ; 2@@ 34 : 40@@ 4 ) . &quot;
factors such as a low ha@@ em@@ ato@@ cr@@ ite value and low protein concentrations that lead to an increase in the un@@ bound fraction of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus or a strengthening of metabolism caused by treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids should be responsible for the higher clear@@ ance rates observed after transplan@@ tation .
&quot; this suggests that tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus is almost completely met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed before ex@@ cre@@ tion , whereby ex@@ cre@@ tion is mainly carried out via bile . &quot;
&quot; in case of stable patients treated by Pro@@ gra@@ f ( twice daily ) to Adv@@ agra@@ ph ( once daily ) relative to the total daily dose , the systemic exposure of tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus ( AU@@ C@@ 0 @-@ 24 ) under Adv@@ agra@@ f was approximately 10 % lower than under Pro@@ gra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; recommended frequent controls of the tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus test mirror during the first two weeks after transplan@@ tation , followed by periodi@@ c checks during maintenance therapy . &quot;
&quot; 21 For the treatment of adult patients with gra@@ ft rejection , which proved to be refrac@@ tory to other immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ress@@ ants , there are no clinical data for the ret@@ ar@@ ded formulation of Adv@@ agra@@ f . &quot;
&quot; other factors that increase the risk of such clinical disorders are an already existing heart disease , a treatment with cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , high blood pressure , kidney or liver dysfunction , infections , fluid over@@ load and ede@@ ma . &quot;
28 confirmed acute rejection was 3@@ 2.6 % within the first 24 weeks ( N = 2@@ 37 ) 3@@ 2.6 % and in the Pro@@ gra@@ f Group ( N = 2@@ 34 ) 29.@@ 3 % .

&quot; advoc@@ ates are used to treat and prevent hem@@ ophi@@ lia A ( caused by the lack of factor VI@@ II , con@@ genital blood coag@@ ulation disorder ) . &quot;
the dosage and frequency of the application determine whether adv@@ ate is used to treat bleeding or to prevent bleeding during surgical procedures .
&quot; patients with hem@@ ophi@@ lia A suffer from a factor VI@@ II deficiency , which causes blood cl@@ ot@@ ting problems such as bleeding in joints , muscles or internal organs . &quot;
&quot; Oc@@ to@@ co@@ g al@@ fa is not extracted from human plasma , but is produced using a method known as &quot; re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a cell in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , enabling it to form the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; Adv@@ ate is similar to another medicine approved in the European Union called Rec@@ om@@ bin@@ ate , but is made differently so that the drug does not contain any proteins of human or animal origin . &quot;
&quot; in three additional studies in patients with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A , including a study with 53 children under six years , the use of the medicine was examined for the prevention of bleeding and surgical procedures . &quot;
&quot; in the main study , the efficacy of adv@@ ate in the prevention of bleeding was assessed in 86 % of 5@@ 10 new blood c@@ anti@@ cs with &quot; &quot; excellent &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; good &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of adv@@ ate ( observed from 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) are di@@ zz@@ iness , head@@ aches , py@@ re@@ x@@ ia ( fever ) and the formation of antibodies against factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; lawyers may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the human coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II , mouse or ham@@ ster protein or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in March 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Ba@@ x@@ ter AG company for the marketing of lawyers in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; dosage The dosage and duration of sub@@ stitution treatment follow the severity of the factor VI@@ II deficiency , after the place and the extent of the bleeding and the clinical condition of the patient . &quot;
&quot; in the following hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic events , the factor VI@@ II activity in the corresponding period is not to fall under the specified amount of plasma ( in % of the standard or I.@@ E. / dl ) . &quot;
injection every 12 @-@ 24 hours ( 8 @-@ 24 hours for patients under 6 years ) for 3 @-@ 4 days or longer until the pain and acute impair@@ ment are removed .
injection every 8 @-@ 24 hours ( 6 @-@ 12 hours for patients under 6 years ) until the risk for the patient is over .
&quot; during the course of treatment , the dose and frequency of inj@@ ections are recommended to control the dose of VI@@ II @-@ plas@@ m@@ asphalt . &quot;
&quot; individual patients may differ in response to Factor VI@@ II , different in vi@@ vo recovery and have different half @-@ value times . &quot;
3 Proph@@ yla@@ xis for long @-@ term proph@@ yla@@ xis of bleeding in patients with severe ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A should be given doses between 20 and 40 I.@@ U. of factor VI@@ II per kg body weight at a distance of 2 @-@ 3 days .
&quot; if the expected factor VI@@ II plasma activities are not reached or if bleeding is not dominated by an appropriate dose , a test must be carried out in order to prove an inhibit@@ or if necessary . &quot;
&quot; in patients with high inhibit@@ ors , it is possible that the factor VI@@ II therapy is not effective , so other therapeutic measures must be considered . &quot;
&quot; the speed of the dose should be directed after finding the patient , and a maximum injection rate of 10 ml / min should not be exceeded . &quot;
the formation of neutr@@ alizing antibodies against Factor VI@@ II is a well @-@ known complic@@ ation in treating patients with ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A .
&quot; these inhibit@@ ors are always opposed to the pro@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory activity of factor VI@@ II , Ig@@ G immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , which are quanti@@ fied in Beth@@ es@@ da units ( B.@@ E. ) per ml plasma by means of modified Beth@@ es@@ da As@@ say . &quot;
&quot; the risk of developing inhibit@@ ors cor@@ relates with the extent of exposure to the Factor VI@@ II , whereby the risk within the first 20 exposure days is the greatest and depends on genetic and other factors . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ treated patients ( PT@@ Ps ) with more than 100 exposure days and an@@ am@@ nes@@ tically known inhibit@@ ors development , after switching from a re@@ combin@@ ant factor VI@@ II product to another , the re@@ occurrence of ( low @-@ tri@@ vial ) inhibit@@ ors was observed . &quot;
&quot; due to the rare occurrence of hem@@ ophi@@ lia A in women , there are no experiences about the use of factor VI@@ II during pregnancy and lac@@ tation . &quot;
&quot; the AD@@ R@@ s treated with the greatest number of patients were inhibit@@ ors against factor VI@@ II ( 5 patients ) , all of whom had previously untreated patients , which have a higher risk of inhibit@@ ors formation , headache ( 5 patients ) , fever and di@@ zz@@ iness ( 3 patients each ) . &quot;
&quot; very often ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , frequently ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 100 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 to &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , very rare ( frequency based on available data is not estimated ) . &quot;
a ) The percentage of patients was calculated using the sum of the individual patients ( 2@@ 34 ) . the unexpected drop of the blood coag@@ ulation factor VI@@ II @-@ Spi@@ egels was performed post@@ oper@@ atively ( 10th - 14th postoperative day ) in a patient under continuous A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E in@@ fusion .
blood cl@@ ot@@ ting was maintained throughout the time and both the factor VI@@ II@@ - Spiegel in the plasma and the clearance rate showed sufficient levels again on the 15th postoperative day .

in none of 53 pa@@ edi@@ atric patients with an age of less than 6 years and diagnosed with severe to moderate ha@@ em@@ ophi@@ lia A ( F@@ VI@@ II ≤ 2 % ) a F@@ VI@@ II inhibit@@ or was found under previous exposure to Factor VI@@ II@@ - concentr@@ ates ( ≥ 50 days ) .
&quot; in previously untreated patients of an ongoing clinical trial , 5 out of 25 ( 20 % ) with A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E treated patients with inhibit@@ ors against Factor VI@@ II . &quot;
&quot; the patient &apos;s immune response to traces of contaminated proteins was analysed by investigating the antibody ti@@ ters against these proteins , laboratory parameters and reported side effects . &quot;
&quot; a patient showed a statisti@@ cally significant upward trend as well as a persistent peak of antibody levels against anti @-@ CH@@ O cell protein , but otherwise no signs or symptoms referred to an allergic reaction or hyper@@ sensitivity occurred . &quot;
&quot; in four patients , the occurrence of ur@@ tic@@ aria , pr@@ ur@@ itus , rash and increased number of e@@ os@@ in@@ ophi@@ le gran@@ u@@ loc@@ ytes was reported in several repeated product ex@@ positions within the study . &quot;

&quot; based on the data available since the initial approval , the CH@@ MP has furthermore assessed the benefits risk assessment as positive , but considering that the safety profile must be closely monitored for the following reasons : &quot;
&quot; therefore , the CH@@ MP has decided on the basis of A@@ DV@@ AT@@ E &apos;s safety profile that necess@@ it@@ ates a filing of P@@ SU@@ R@@ s every 6 months , that the regi@@ stran@@ t should apply for another extension procedure in 5 years . &quot;
&quot; in December 2008 , Gen@@ du@@ x Mol@@ ecular Limited granted the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) that the Company accepts its application for the use of Adv@@ ex@@ in for the treatment of Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer . &quot;
&quot; normally , however , the breast , the brain , the bones or the soft tissues ( tissue that connects other structures in the body , surrounds and supports ) are affected . &quot;
this is a kind of virus that genetically modified to carry a gene into the body &apos;s cells .
the virus in adv@@ ex@@ in is a &quot; Aden@@ o@@ virus &quot; that has been modified so that there are no copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans .
&quot; Adv@@ ex@@ in could have been directly inj@@ ected into the tum@@ ors , allowing cancer cells to re@@ form the normal p@@ 53 protein . &quot;
&quot; the p@@ 53 protein , which is made of the non @-@ defective p@@ 53 gene in the human body , normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered . &quot;
&quot; in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i &apos;s cancer , where the p@@ 53 gene is defective , the p@@ 53 protein is not working properly , and cancer cells can continue to grow and share . &quot;
&quot; the company presented data from a study with a patient , in which Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i cancer occurred in the area of the sub@@ structure , in the bones and in the brain . &quot;
&quot; after the CH@@ MP tested the company &apos;s answers to the questions posed by him , some questions were still unclear . &quot;
&quot; based on the review of the initial filing documents , the CH@@ MP creates a list of questions sent to the company on Day 120 . &quot;
&quot; according to the CH@@ MP , it has not been sufficiently proven that the injection of adv@@ ex in Li @-@ Frau@@ men@@ i tumours will benefit patients . &quot;
&quot; the Committee also had concerns regarding the processing of the drug in the body , the type of administration and the safety of the drug . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the company had not sufficiently demonstrated that Adv@@ ex@@ in can be produced in a reliable way and that it is neither harmful to the environment nor for people who come in close contact with the patient . &quot;
the company did not inform the CH@@ MP whether the withdrawal has consequences for patients currently participating in clinical trials or &quot; Com@@ passionate @-@ Use &quot; programs with Adv@@ ex@@ in .
&quot; changed drug release &quot; means that the tablets are so composed that one of the effective ingredients is released immediately and the other slowly over a few hours .
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is used to treat symptoms of seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever caused by allergies to pol@@ len ) in patients with nas@@ al mu@@ cous swelling ( c@@ logged nose ) .
&quot; for adults and adolescents age 12 , the recommended dose of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is twice daily a tablet , which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food . &quot;
&quot; the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms , especially the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a ( c@@ logged nose ) , are cl@@ ung . &quot;
a treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose .
the main activity measurements were the changes in severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to treatment and during the 15 @-@ day treatment .
during the study patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours .
&quot; considering all hay fever symptoms , except the con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose , patients who received aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze reported a decrease in symptoms by 4@@ 6.0 % compared to 3@@ 5.@@ 9 % in patients receiving pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine alone . &quot;
&quot; if only the swelling of the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a was considered , the patients under aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze showed a relief of the symptoms by 3@@ 7.@@ 4 % compared to 26.@@ 7 % in the patients receiving the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n alone . &quot;
&quot; the most frequent side effects of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze ( observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients ) are t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( heart ch@@ asing ) , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , psych@@ omot@@ or hyper@@ activity ( loss of appetite ) , con@@ sti@@ pation , headache , fatigue , in@@ som@@ nia ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ) , sleep disorders and nerv@@ ousness . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine or any of the other ingredients , against adren@@ ergi@@ c agents or Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( another medicine for the treatment of allergies ) . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should also not be used in patients who suffer from a narrow @-@ angle glaucoma ( elevated intra@@ ocular pressure ) , cardiac or vascular disease including hyper@@ tension ( hyper@@ tension ) , hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ( hyper@@ thy@@ ro@@ sis ) or a risk of hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ gic stroke . &quot;
&quot; on 30 July 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; the tablet can be taken with a glass of water , but can be swal@@ lowed whole ( i.e. without tear@@ ing , breaking or ch@@ ewing ) . &quot;
aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in children under the age of 12 due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy ( see section 5.1 ) .
the duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms fade away .
&quot; it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days , as long @-@ term use can decrease the activity of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with time . &quot;
&quot; after the swelling of the mu@@ cous membranes in the upper respiratory tract , treatment may be continued as mon@@ otherapy if necessary . &quot;
&quot; since Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze contains pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , the medicine is also contra@@ indicated in patients treated with a mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ or within 2 weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; this is due to al@@ ph@@ am@@ im@@ etic activity in combined application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine with other vas@@ o@@ con@@ stric@@ tors such as bro@@ mo@@ cri@@ pi@@ tin , per@@ go@@ lid , l@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ erg@@ ot@@ amine or other de@@ on@@ ges@@ tive substances that are per@@ ched or nas@@ al as abnormal r@@ hin@@ ology ( phen@@ yl@@ pro@@ pan@@ ol@@ amine , phen@@ y@@ le@@ phr@@ ine , eph@@ ed@@ rine , oxy@@ met@@ az@@ oline , nap@@ haz@@ olin etc . ) . &quot;
the safety and efficacy of this combination therapy were not checked for this patient collective and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations .
&quot; the safety and efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze were not tested in patients with kidney or liver dysfunction , and the data is not sufficient to pron@@ ounce appropriate dosage recommendations . &quot;
&quot; patients must be informed that treatment in case of hyper@@ tension or t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders , nausea or any other neuro@@ logical symptoms ( such as head@@ aches or a strengthening of head@@ aches ) must be stopped . &quot;
&quot; patients with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with hyper@@ tension • Pati@@ ents with a m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus , bladder neck and bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m in an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze is at least 48 hours before the implementation of der@@ mat@@ ological tests , since anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines otherwise can prevent or reduce positive reactions to indicators of skin reactions . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were administered in addition , no clin@@ ically relevant interactions or changes in the plasma concentration of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were observed . &quot;
the results of the psych@@ omot@@ or test showed no significant differences between the patients treated with the loss of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and the patients treated with placebo regardless of whether the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was alone or with alcohol .
&quot; the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified , so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , and in vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 is not inhibit@@ ing and neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins is . &quot;
&quot; the harm@@ lessness of the use of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze during pregnancy is not assured , but experiences from a large number of affected pregn@@ ancies could not increase the frequency of ab@@ norm@@ alities compared to the frequency in the normal population . &quot;
&quot; since reproductive studies on animals cannot always be transferred to humans and due to the vas@@ o@@ con@@ stri@@ c properties of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine , aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze should not be used in pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in a di@@ zz@@ iness which may result in impaired traffic or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; symptoms may vary between a CN@@ S depression ( se@@ dation , ap@@ nea , dimin@@ ished mental attention , cy@@ an@@ sis , coma , cardiovascular collapse ) and a CN@@ S stimulation ( sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , tre@@ mor , conv@@ ul@@ sions ) with possible let@@ ter@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; headache , anxiety , difficult mic@@ tion , muscle weakness and increased muscle tension , eu@@ ph@@ oria , arous@@ al , respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency , cardiac ar@@ rhyth@@ mia , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia , pal@@ pit@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , t@@ innitus , at@@ ax@@ ia , visual disturbances and hyper@@ tension or hyp@@ ot@@ ony . &quot;
&quot; a CN@@ S stimulation is especially prob@@ able in children , as well as at@@ rop@@ in @-@ typical symptoms ( mouth dry , pup@@ il stiff@@ ness and - di@@ lat@@ ation , redness , hyper@@ ther@@ mia and gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ) . &quot;
&quot; these include both the suspension of the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
&quot; in an individual dose study with adults , dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flow rate , including rein@@ forcing subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; the oral application of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine in the recommended dosage can cause further symp@@ om@@ im@@ etic effects , such as an increase in blood pressure , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia or manifestations of CN@@ S arous@@ al . &quot;
&quot; there were 1,@@ 24@@ 8 patients aged 12 to 78 with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , with 4@@ 14 patients receiving aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the hist@@ amine antagon@@ istic efficacy of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets , determined by the overall score for the symptoms ( except nose @-@ mu@@ cous swelling ) , was significantly higher than under a mon@@ otherapy with pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine on the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets with regard to the swelling effect , determined by the nas@@ al mu@@ cos@@ a swelling , was significantly higher than in a mon@@ otherapy with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n over the 2 @-@ week treatment period . &quot;
&quot; the effectiveness of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets showed no significant differences with regard to gender , age or ethnic origin . &quot;
&quot; as part of an individual dose study on the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze , des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n is det@@ ectable in plasma within 30 minutes of the dose . &quot;
&quot; after the per@@ or@@ al application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze in healthy subjects over 14 days , the flow equivalent of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , 3 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was reached on day 10 . &quot;
&quot; in the context of a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multiple dose study carried out with the formulation as a tablet in healthy adult subjects , it was noted that four volunteers were ill @-@ metabol@@ ised . &quot;
a component interaction study shows that the exposure ( C@@ MA@@ x and AU@@ C ) of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine after the sole administration of pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine is bio@@ equivalent to exposure to an aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablet .
&quot; however , based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; the combination had no greater toxic@@ ity than its individual components , and the observed effects were generally related to the substance pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine . &quot;
in reproductive toxic@@ ological studies the combination of Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n / Pseu@@ do@@ eph@@ ed@@ rine was not ter@@ ato@@ genic in the oral administration of rats at a dose of up to 150 mg / kg / day and to rab@@ bits in a dose of up to 120 mg / kg / day .
&quot; in March 2007 and in Module 1.@@ 8.1 of the authorisation application described , pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance system is established and works before and while the product is on the market . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines contribute to allevi@@ ating allergic symptoms by preventing hist@@ amine , a body &apos;s own substance , its effect . &quot;
&quot; aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze tablets allevi@@ ate symptoms associated with seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( hay fever ) , such as sne@@ e@@ zing , running or it@@ ching nose and tear@@ ing or it@@ ching eyes while con@@ sti@@ pation of the nose . &quot;

&quot; tell your doctor if you encounter or diagnose the following symptoms or diseases in the application of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze : hyper@@ tension , heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart rhythm disorders • nausea and head@@ aches , or strengthening existing head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; when taking Aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken medication , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
comp@@ action in the recommended dosage is not to be expected that aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze conduc@@ ts di@@ zz@@ iness or reduces the attention .
if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you ought to inform immediately your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken a larger amount of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze than you should .
&quot; if you have forgotten the intake of aer@@ in@@ a@@ ze if you forgot to take a dose in time , get the application as soon as possible and apply the next dose at the scheduled time . &quot;

&quot; after the market launch of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n very rarely has been reported about cases of severe allergic reactions ( breathing difficulty , whi@@ stling breathing , it@@ ching , hi@@ ves , hi@@ ves ) or skin rash . &quot;
&quot; cases of heart pal@@ pit@@ ations , heart ch@@ asing , stomach pain , nausea , vom@@ iting , stomach upset , diar@@ rhe@@ a , hall@@ u@@ cin@@ ations , di@@ zz@@ iness , di@@ zz@@ iness , obesity , rest@@ lessness with increased physical activity , about cases of liver inflammation and about cases of conspic@@ uous liver values has also been reported very rarely . &quot;
&quot; it is available as 5 mg tablet , 5 mg Ly@@ ophil@@ is@@ at ( soluble tablet ) , 2.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup tablets ( tablets that dissolve in the mouth ) , 0.5 mg / ml sy@@ rup and 0.5 mg / ml solution . &quot;
&quot; for children aged one to five years , the dose is 1.@@ 25 mg once a day , which is in the form of 2.5 ml sy@@ rup or milk . &quot;
&quot; for children aged six to eleven years , the dose is 2.5 mg once a day , either in the form of 5 ml sy@@ rup or &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us was examined in eight studies involving approximately 4,@@ 800 adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including four trials in seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and two studies on patients who also had asthma ) . &quot;
&quot; efficacy was measured by identifying symptoms ( it@@ ching , number and size of the quad@@ r@@ cles , impair@@ ment of sleep and performance on days ) before and after six weeks of treatment . &quot;
&quot; further studies have been submitted to verify that the body evalu@@ ates the sy@@ rup , the solution to the intake and the melting tablets in the same way as the tablets and the application in children is safe . &quot;
&quot; in case of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , if the results of all studies were taken together , the two @-@ week treatment with 5 mg A@@ eri@@ us resulted in an average decrease in the symptom scores ( symptom marks ) by 25 to 32 % , compared to the decrease of 12 to 26 % in patients receiving placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two trials in Ur@@ tic@@ aria , the decrease in symptoms after six weeks of treatment with A@@ eri@@ us 58 and 67 % , compared to 40 and 33 % in the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; in January 2001 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company SP Europe for the transport of A@@ eri@@ us throughout the European Union . &quot;
&quot; a tablet once a day , with or without a meal , to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and Ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
there is limited experience in clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 ) .
the treatment of the inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks ) should be done according to the previous disease progression and can be completed after the end of symptoms and resum@@ ing .
the persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days per week and over 4 weeks ) can be recommended to patients during the allergy period .
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not as@@ cer@@ tained in clinical trials with dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , the effect of alcohol was not increased while taking A@@ eri@@ us and alcohol ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be informed that in very rare cases it may result in di@@ zz@@ iness , which can lead to impaired traffic or ability to operate machinery . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us at the recommended dose of 5 mg daily compared to patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; the most frequently reported adverse events reported more frequently than placebo were ti@@ redness ( 1,2 % ) , mouth dri@@ p ( 0.8 % ) and headache ( 0.@@ 6 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial of 5@@ 78 young patients from 12 to 17 years , the most common adverse event was head@@ aches , which occurred in 5.@@ 9 % of patients treated with a loss of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and 6.@@ 9 % of patients who were treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , which was administered up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; this includes inhibit@@ ing the release of pro @-@ inflammatory cy@@ tok@@ ines such as IL @-@ 4 , IL @-@ 6 , IL @-@ 8 and IL @-@ 13 from human mast cells / bas@@ ophil@@ es as well as the in@@ hibition of the expression of the adhesion molecules P @-@ sel@@ tin on end@@ othel@@ ial cells . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was administered daily for more than 14 days .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was administered for more than ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study with adults , dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flow rate , including rein@@ forcing subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s can be divided in dependence on the duration of symptoms alternatively also in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s are defined as the appearance of symptoms for less than 4 days per week or less than 4 weeks .
persi@@ sting allergic rh@@ initi@@ s is defined as the appearance of symptoms at 4 or more days a week and over 4 weeks .
&quot; as shown in the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life at Rhin@@ o @-@ conjunction jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us effectively reduces the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the chron@@ ically idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria was investigated on behalf of other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , as the underlying path@@ ophysi@@ ology , not@@ withstanding the e@@ ti@@ ology , is similar to the different forms and chronic patients are easier to pro@@ spec@@ tively recru@@ it . &quot;
&quot; since the history of hist@@ amine is a caus@@ ative factor in all ur@@ inary diseases , it is expected that in other forms of ur@@ tic@@ aria , it is also possible to improve the symptoms ; this is confirmed by the recommendations of clinical guidelines . &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ r@@ als at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; as in other studies with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines in chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , the minority of patients who did not respond to anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines were excluded from the study . &quot;
an improvement in the it@@ ching rate by more than 50 % was observed in 55 % of patients treated with des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n compared to 19 % of patients treated with placebo .
the treatment with A@@ eri@@ us significantly reduced the distur@@ b@@ ance of sleep and wak@@ efulness as measured by a 4 @-@ point scale for evaluating these variables .
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study , in which patients were comparable to the general seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s population , 4 % of patients had a higher concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant cum@@ ulation following once daily application of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines are not completely excluded . &quot;
&quot; in @-@ vi@@ vo not C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and in @-@ vitro studies have shown that the drug C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 does not inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 , neither a medium nor an inhibit@@ or of P @-@ gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ eins . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose study involving lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in a dose of 7.5 mg , meals ( fatty , cal@@ orie @-@ rich breakfast ) did not affect the availability of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the pre @-@ clinical studies conducted with Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n showed no qualitative or quantitative differences in the toxic@@ ity profile of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , and Lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity and reproductive toxic@@ ity , the prec@@ lin@@ ical data with the loss of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;

&quot; A@@ eri@@ us may be taken independent of meals , for allevi@@ ating symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the prescri@@ bing doctor should be aware that most cases of rh@@ initi@@ s in children under 2 years are caused by infection ( see section 4.4 ) and that no data is available which support a treatment of infectious rh@@ initi@@ s with ap@@ eri@@ us .
&quot; in addition to the exclusion of upper respiratory tract infections or anatom@@ ical anom@@ ali@@ es , the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis , physical examination and appropriate laboratory and skin examinations should play a role in the diagnosis . &quot;
about 6 % of adults and children between 2 and 11 years have been met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed in the met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n and experienced higher substance exposure ( see section 5.2 ) .
the safety of A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup in children aged between 2 and 11 years is identical to those in children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
&quot; this medicine contains su@@ c@@ rose and sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase @-@ is@@ om@@ alt@@ as@@ e- in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take this medicine . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally administered ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , while taking A@@ eri@@ us tablets and alcohol , the performance @-@ reducing effect of alcohol was not increased ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the overall incidence of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the placebo group in the A@@ eri@@ us sy@@ rup group .
&quot; in clinical trials with adults and adolescents in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us in the recommended dose than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study of adults and adolescents , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
children aged between 1 and 11 years old who were eligible for an anti@@ hist@@ amine therapy received a daily des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine dose of 1.@@ 25 mg ( aged between 1 and 5 years ) or 2.5 mg ( aged between 6 and 11 years ) .
&quot; because the course of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s / chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria and the profile of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n are similar in adults and children , the efficacy data of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adults can be extra@@ pol@@ ated to the children &apos;s population . &quot;
&quot; no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical trial involving multiple doses of adults and adolescents , in which a dose of up to 20 mg daily has been applied daily for 14 days . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study of adults and adolescents , in which a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for ten days in adults , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a single dose of 7.5 mg , A@@ eri@@ us tablets in adults and adolescents in clinical studies led to no impair@@ ment of psych@@ omot@@ or . &quot;
&quot; in clinical pharmac@@ ological studies in adults , the simultaneous consumption of alcohol did not increase the risk of alcohol @-@ induced impair@@ ment , nor to increase drow@@ sin@@ ess . &quot;
&quot; in adults and adolescents with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the overall score of the questionnaire for quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the allergic rh@@ initi@@ s caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s &quot;
&quot; in two placebo @-@ controlled trials for 6 weeks in patients with chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , A@@ eri@@ us was effective in the improvement of pr@@ ur@@ itus and the reduction of size and number of quad@@ r@@ als at the end of the first dose interval . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children from 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adult , 3 % children ) . &quot;
similar pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic parameters were observed in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic multi@@ dose study with sy@@ rup formulation of children aged 2 to 11 with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s that inhi@@ bit the metabolism .
the load ( AU@@ C ) by Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n was about 6@@ times higher after 3 to 6 hours and the C@@ MA@@ x about 3 to 4 times higher with a terminal half @-@ life of about 120 hours .
there are no indications of clin@@ ically relevant drug accumulation after once daily application of dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( 5@@ - 20 mg ) over 14 days in adults and adolescents .
12 in various single dose studies showed that the AU@@ C@@ - and C@@ MA@@ x values of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n were comparable to the recommended doses of pedi@@ atric patients who received a dose of 5 mg in a dose of 5 mg .
&quot; however , the enzyme responsible for the metabolism of the lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n has not yet been identified so that interactions with other medicines can not be completely ruled out . &quot;

&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the ly@@ ophi@@ le must be removed without damaging it . &quot;
clin@@ ically relevant interactions were not found in clinical trials with A@@ eri@@ us tablets in which ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin or k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole were additionally applied ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials in different indications including allergic rh@@ initi@@ s and chronic idi@@ opathic ur@@ tic@@ aria , 3 % more adverse events were reported in patients with A@@ eri@@ us tablets daily than in patients treated with placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a multi @-@ dose study , with up to 45 mg of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( nine @-@ fold clinical dose ) , no clin@@ ically relevant effects were observed . &quot;
&quot; in two single dose studies , A@@ eri@@ us Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at was well tolerated ; this was documented by clinical laboratory results , medical examinations , vital signs and EC@@ G interval data . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied daily for more than 14 days .
&quot; in a clinical pharmac@@ ological study , in which a dose of 45 mg daily ( the nine times the clinical dose ) was applied for more than ten days , there was no pro@@ long@@ ation of the Q@@ t@@ c interval . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 m@@ g. a day , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in a 17 single dose study with adults , dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters of the flow rate , including rein@@ forcing subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;

two A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets once daily put in the mouth to relieve the symptoms of allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ( including inter@@ mitt@@ ent and persistent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s ) and ur@@ tic@@ aria ( see section 5.1 ) .
there is limited experience in clinical trials for efficacy in the use of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in adolescents from 12 to 17 years ( see Sec@@ tions 4.@@ 8 and 5.1 )
&quot; immediately before application , the bli@@ ster must be carefully opened and the dose of the melting tray is removed without damaging it . &quot;
the efficacy and safety of A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg melting tablets in children under 6 years of age have not been proven .
the overall frequency of side effects between the des@@ lor@@ at@@ ad@@ ine sy@@ rup and the placebo group was the same and did not differ significantly from the safety profile identified in adult patients .
&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at for the dimin@@ ishing formulation of cas@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study with multiple doses in which a dose of up to 20 mg daily was applied daily over 14 days , no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically significant &quot;

&quot; the spread of this poorly met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed phen@@ otype was comparable to adult ( 6 % ) and pedi@@ atric patients between 2 and 11 years ( 6 % ) , and among bl@@ acks ( adults 18 % , children 16 % ) , but the safety profile of these patients was not different from that of the general population . &quot;
&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us melting tray with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
&quot; A@@ eri@@ us 2.5 mg tablets were not examined in pedi@@ atric patients , however , in combination with the dose @-@ finding studies in children , however , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data for A@@ eri@@ us melting tablets support the use of 2.5 mg dosage in children from 6 to 11 years . &quot;

&quot; at the recommended dose , A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg melting tablet proved to be a bio@@ equivalent to the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablet formulation and the A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at for the dimin@@ ishing formulation of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
no statisti@@ cally significant or clin@@ ically relevant cardiovascular effect was described as part of a clinical study with multiple doses in which a dose of up to 20 m@@ g. a day was applied daily for more than 14 days .
&quot; for a 30 @-@ one @-@ dose study with adults , dis@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n 5 mg showed no influence on standard measurement parameters including rein@@ forcing subjective drow@@ sin@@ ess or the tasks associated with flying . &quot;
&quot; in patients with allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , A@@ eri@@ us tablets were effective in allevi@@ ating symptoms such as sne@@ e@@ zing , nas@@ al secre@@ tion and it@@ ching of the nose , it@@ ching , lac@@ ri@@ mal drainage and redness of the eyes as well as it@@ ching on the palate . &quot;
&quot; in single dose @-@ crossover studies of A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg mel@@ ts coated with A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg conventional tablets or A@@ eri@@ us 5 mg Ly@@ phil@@ is@@ at , the form@@ ulations were bio@@ equivalent . &quot;
the overall analysis of prec@@ lin@@ ical and clinical irrit@@ ation tests for the melting tray revealed that this formulation is an unlikely risk for local irrit@@ ation in clinical application .
the safety of lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n in children aged between 2 and 11 years is identical to those in children who are normally met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed .
&quot; this medicine contains sor@@ bit@@ ol ; therefore , patients with her@@ edi@@ tary problems of fru@@ ct@@ ose intoler@@ ance , glucose @-@ gal@@ act@@ ose absorption or sac@@ char@@ ase in@@ suffici@@ ency of this medicine should not take this medicine . &quot;
the overall frequency of adverse events in children aged 2 to 11 was similar to the placebo group .
&quot; in infants between 6 and 23 months , the most common adverse events reported were diar@@ rhe@@ a ( 3.@@ 7 % ) , fever ( 2,3 % ) and sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness ( 2,3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in an additional study , no adverse events were observed in patients aged between 6 and 11 years at a single dose of 2.5 mg of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in the recommended doses , the plasma concentrations of Des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n ( see Section 5.2 ) were comparable in pa@@ edi@@ atric and adult population . &quot;
&quot; in controlled clinical trials at the recommended dosage of 5 mg daily for adults and adolescents , there was no increased frequency of drow@@ sin@@ ess compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the established classification in seas@@ on@@ ally and per@@ ennial , allergic rh@@ initi@@ s may alternatively also occur in inter@@ mitt@@ ent allergic rh@@ initi@@ s , depending on the duration of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; as shown in the overall score of the questionnaire to improve quality of life in Rhin@@ o @-@ con@@ jun@@ c@@ tivi@@ tis , A@@ eri@@ us tablets effectively reduce the burden caused by seasonal allergic rh@@ initi@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the spread of this limited met@@ abo@@ li@@ zing phen@@ otype was comparable to adults ( 6 % ) and children from 2 to 11 years ( 6 % ) and in both populations greater in black ( 18 % adults , 16 % children ) than with Cau@@ ca@@ si@@ ans ( 2 % adult , 3 % children ) . &quot;
&quot; as A@@ eri@@ us solution for taking the same concentration of des@@ lor@@ at@@ adi@@ n , no bio @-@ equi@@ valence study was required and it is expected that it corresponds to the sy@@ rup and the tablets . &quot;

June 2008 Nov@@ arti@@ s V@@ acc@@ ines and Diagnostics S.@@ r.@@ l. officially approved the CH@@ MP &apos;s Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for Medic@@ inal Products for A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov to prevent avi@@ ar H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 influenza in adults and elderly people .
A@@ fl@@ un@@ ov should be used in adults and elderly people to protect against flu caused by the strain ( type ) H@@ 5@@ N@@ 1 of the influenza A virus .
this is a special kind of vaccine that should protect against a strain of flu virus that could cause a future pan@@ de@@ mic .
&quot; a flu pan@@ de@@ mic breaks out when a new stem of the flu virus emerges , which can easily spread from man to man because human beings have no immunity ( no protection ) against it . &quot;
&quot; following the vaccine , the immune system detects the constitu@@ ent parts of the flu virus as &quot; &quot; foreign &quot; &quot; and form antibodies against it . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the immune system is later able to form antibodies faster in contact with a flu virus . &quot;
&quot; subsequently , the membrane of the virus with the &quot; surface anti@@ gens &quot; ( proteins on the membrane surface that the human body recognizes as a body alien ) has been puri@@ fied , puri@@ fied and used as a component of the vaccine . &quot;
inspection of some of the study centres showed that the study was not conducted according to the &quot; good clinical practice &quot; ( G@@ CP ) .
&quot; as a result , the scale of the clinical data base for evaluating the safety of the vaccine was not sufficient to meet the requirements of the E@@ MEA Gui@@ delines for pre @-@ pan@@ de@@ mic vacc@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; if you are participating in a clinical trial and require further information on your treatment , please contact your attending physician . &quot;
&quot; if you would like more information on the basis of CH@@ MP recommendations , please read the scientific discussion ( also part of the EP@@ AR ) . &quot;
&quot; it is used in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines to treat adults and children over four years , which are infected with the human immun@@ o@@ deficiency virus type 1 ( HIV @-@ 1 ) , which causes the acquired immun@@ o@@ deficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) . &quot;
&quot; for patients who cannot swallow the capsules , there is a solution to intake , but this cannot be taken together with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , as the safety of this combination has not been investigated . &quot;
&quot; when the doctor has checked what anti@@ viral drug the patient has previously taken , it should be reported that the virus will appeal to the medicine . &quot;
&quot; the recommended dose for patients over twelve years is 600 mg twice daily , which are taken together with twice daily 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and with other anti@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in children between four and twelve years and in patients with a body weight of less than 50 kg , the recommended dose of as@@ under @-@ body depends on body weight . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ viral medicines , am@@ gener@@ ase reduces the amount of HIV in the blood and keeps them at a low level . &quot;
&quot; AIDS is not to be cured , but can delay the damage to the immune system and thus also the development of infections and diseases associated with AIDS . &quot;
&quot; am@@ er@@ ase was studied in combination with other anti@@ viral drugs , but without Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , in two main studies with 7@@ 36 HIV @-@ infected adults who had previously not been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the drug used with low dos@@ ed ri@@ de@@ avi@@ r was compared to other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in 20@@ 6 adults , which used to be prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the proportion of patients with non @-@ det@@ ectable levels of HIV in the blood ( viral load ) or the modification of the viral load after treatment .
&quot; in studies with patients who had previously had no prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , more patients had a viral load under 400 copies / ml than placebo in 48 weeks , but A@@ gen@@ ase was less effective than In@@ din@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in children , as@@ under also reduced the viral load , but only very few of the children who had previously been treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were only very few in the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in the study of adults , who had previously been treated with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , the drugs as@@ ol@@ ase ampli@@ fied with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r increased the viral load after 16 weeks of treatment just as effective as other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; in the patients with HIV , which was resistant to four other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors , there was a stronger decline in the viral load after four weeks , along with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , after four weeks as in the patients who continued their previous prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of am@@ gener@@ ase ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are headache , diar@@ rho@@ ea , flat@@ ul@@ ence , nausea , vom@@ iting , rash and fatigue ( fatigue ) . &quot;
2 / 3 A@@ cou@@ asis may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r or any of the other ingredients .
&quot; it may not be used in patients , St. John &apos;s wort ( a herbal supplement for the treatment of depression ) or medicines which are degra@@ ded in the same way as ag@@ ro@@ sis and are detri@@ mental to health in high concentrations in the blood . &quot;
&quot; as with other medicines for HIV , patients who take as@@ under are the risk of li@@ po@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ( changes in the distribution of the body fat ) , o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose ( loss of bone tissue ) or an immun@@ o@@ activation syndrome ( symptoms of an infection caused by the re@@ covering immune system ) . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of am@@ using in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral drugs used to treat HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected adults and children over four years against the risks .
&quot; A@@ cou@@ ase is usually taken together with the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic amplifier Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the committee stated that the benefit of as@@ ol@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r was not proven in patients who had previously not been a prot@@ ease inhibit@@ or . &quot;
&quot; A@@ gen@@ ase was originally licensed under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since only limited information was required at the time of approval for scientific reasons . &quot;
&quot; in October 2000 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit for the transport of as@@ under in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children ages 4 and older . &quot;
&quot; usually , am@@ on@@ ase capsules are to be given to pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic boo@@ ster of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see Sec@@ tions 4.2 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
the use of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r should take place taking into account the individual viral resistance pattern and the pre@@ treatment of the patient ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than from am@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a capsule , therefore , the intake capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see paragraph 5.2 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose for am@@ on@@ ase capsules amounts to 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily along with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines .
&quot; 2 If A@@ generic Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the ampli@@ fying additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of am@@ er@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for am@@ on@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics , efficacy and safety of as@@ under in combination with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were not examined in children . &quot;
&quot; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; based on pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic data , the dose of am@@ gener@@ ase capsules in adult patients with moderate liver dysfunction should be reduced to 450 mg twice daily and in patients with severe liver dysfunction to 300 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; simultaneous use should be done with caution in patients with mild or moderate liver dysfunction , in patients with severe liver dysfunction , it is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ cou@@ asis may not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic breadth , and are also medi@@ ums of the cy@@ to@@ chrome P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) . &quot;
herbal preparations containing St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) may not be used because of the reduced plasma concentrations and the reduced therapeu@@ tical effect of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r during the intake of amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) .
patients should be advised that am@@ er@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they can continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of an HIV infection .
&quot; the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with am@@ er@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmission from HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; usually , re@@ generative capsules should be used together with low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r and in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients suffering from chronic hepatitis B or C and treated with anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy have an increased risk of severe liver cir@@ rho@@ sis with potentially fatal outcome .
&quot; in case of simultaneous anti@@ viral treatment of hepatitis B or C , please read the relevant specialist information of this medicine . &quot;
patients with pre @-@ existing reduced liver function including chronic @-@ active hepatitis show an increased frequency of liver dysfunction in anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy and should be monitored according to clinical practice .
the simultaneous use of am@@ er@@ ase and ri@@ de@@ avi@@ r with flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on or other glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ides that are metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 is not recommended unless the potential benefits of a treatment out@@ weigh systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects including Mor@@ bus C@@ ushing and Supp@@ ression of the adren@@ al function ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; since the metabolism of the H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ or Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , a simultaneous administration of am@@ er@@ ase with Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin is not recommended because of the increased risk of my@@ opath@@ ies including R@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; 4 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under review of the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; in patients who use this medicine at the same time , am@@ on@@ ase may be less effective because of reduced plasma cutting of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the possibility of metabolic interaction with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r , the effectiveness of hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tives may be altered , but the information is not sufficient to assess the type of interactions . &quot;
&quot; if meth@@ ad@@ one is given at the same time with ammon@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for pi@@ racy symptoms , especially if also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r are administered . &quot;
&quot; because of the potential risk of toxic@@ ity due to the high propylene gly@@ cem@@ ic content of the A@@ generation solution , this formulation is contra@@ indicated in children under the age of four and should be applied with caution in certain other patient groups . &quot;
&quot; as@@ under should be removed for duration 5 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
patients who received anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy including prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors were reported about the occurrence of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia or an exac@@ erb@@ ation of an existing diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus .
many of the patients had other diseases that were needed for their therapy to be associated with the development of diabetes m@@ ell@@ itus or hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia .
&quot; B. higher age , and associated with drug @-@ dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis . &quot;
&quot; in the case of an anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections caused by severe clinical conditions or worsen@@ ing of symptoms . &quot;
&quot; although multi@@ fac@@ torial e@@ ti@@ ology is assumed ( including application of cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids , alcohol consumption , heavy immun@@ os@@ upp@@ ression , higher body mass index ) , cases of o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose were reported particularly in patients with advanced HIV disease and / or long @-@ term care of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 substrates with low therapeutic width can not be given at the same time with medicines that have a low therapeutic breadth and are also medi@@ ums of the Cy@@ to@@ ch@@ rom P@@ 450 @-@ I@@ so@@ enzy@@ ms 3@@ A4 ( C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 ) .
C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 @-@ Sub@@ strate with low therapeutic width A@@ generative with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r may not be combined with medicines whose active ingredients are mainly metabol@@ ised via C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and are linked to the increased plasma level with serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects .
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; in the attempt to compensate the reduced plasma level by a dose increase of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , unwanted effects on the liver were observed very often . &quot;
St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) The serum levels of ammon@@ ia can be reduced by the simultaneous use of herbal preparations with St. John &apos;s Wort ( Hyper@@ ic@@ um perfor@@ atum ) .
&quot; if a patient is already cur@@ sing St. John &apos;s wort , the ammon@@ ia mirror and , if possible , check the viral load and reduce St. John &apos;s wort . &quot;
dosage adjustment for one of the medicines is not required when nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r is administered along with ammon@@ avi@@ r ( see also E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z below ) .
&quot; increased 50@@ 8 % , while C@@ MA@@ x decreases by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , dos@@ ages of 600 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r were used twice daily and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily , demonstrating the efficacy and safety of this treatment regi@@ men . &quot;
&quot; decreases 52 % , if Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r ( 750 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with Kal@@ et@@ ra ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with potassium ( 600 mg twice daily ) with potassium ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
&quot; no pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic study was carried out in conjunction with Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in , but it is recommended that Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in and A@@ gen@@ ase income should be at least one hour apart from Di@@ dan@@ os@@ in ( see An@@ ta@@ zi@@ da below ) . &quot;
therefore in combination with am@@ pren@@ e@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) there is no dose adjustment required .
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
the effect of Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in on other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors and existing limited data suggests that Ne@@ vi@@ rap@@ in may possibly reduce the serum concentration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; should this medicine be used at the same time , caution is advised as Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din may be less effective because of the reduced or possibly sub@@ therapeutic plasma level . &quot;
&quot; if this medicine is used together , caution is advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous administration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin resulted in an increase in plasma concentrations ( AU@@ C ) by Ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin by 19@@ 3 % , thus contributing to an increase in the side effects associated with ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ under , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be recommended to at least half of the recommended dose , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic studies with am@@ er@@ ase in combination with ery@@ thro@@ my@@ cin have not been carried out , but both medicines could be increased in case of simultaneous administration . &quot;
the simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg hal@@ on@@ avi@@ r and 100 mg k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole once daily led to an increase in the C@@ MA@@ x of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ole in plasma by 25 % and the AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ Massage ) to 2.@@ 69@@ x compared to the value observed after 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol once daily without simultaneous use of Fos@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; other medicines listed below , including substrates , inhibit@@ ors , or induc@@ tors of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 can , if used together with ag@@ ro@@ ase , may lead to interactions . &quot;
patients should therefore be monitored for toxic reactions associated with these drugs if they are used in combination with am@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; based on the data of other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , it is advisable that ant@@ acids are not taken at the same time as as@@ under , as it can result in resor@@ ption dysfunction . &quot;
&quot; the simultaneous use of anti @-@ conv@@ ul@@ ants known as enzyme duc@@ tors ( phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine ) , with ammon@@ avi@@ r can lead to a degradation of the plasma gas of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ pen@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine
&quot; the con@@ current intake of as@@ under can considerably increase its plasma concentrations and increase side effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study , in which Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg capsules were given twice daily along with 50 µ@@ g flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate in@@ tran@@ as@@ al ( 4 times daily ) over 7 days of study subjects , the flu@@ ti@@ cas@@ on@@ pro@@ pi@@ on@@ ate plasma gas rose by about 86 % ( 90 % confidence interval 82 to 89 % ) . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the con@@ current dose of am@@ er@@ ase with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r along with these glu@@ co@@ cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ides is not recommended unless the possible benefit of a treatment prev@@ ails systemic cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid effects ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors such as Lov@@ ast@@ atin and Sim@@ v@@ ast@@ atin , whose metabolism is strongly dependent on C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , are to be expected with pronounced increases in plasma gas at the same time . &quot;
&quot; as plasma levels of these H@@ MG @-@ Co@@ A @-@ reduc@@ t@@ ase inhibit@@ ors can lead to my@@ opathy , including a r@@ hab@@ dom@@ y@@ oly@@ sis , the combined use of these drugs with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r is not recommended . &quot;
&quot; more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabili@@ zation of the mirror is recommended , as the plasma concentrations of cy@@ clos@@ por@@ in , rap@@ am@@ y@@ cin and tac@@ ro@@ li@@ mus can be increased at the same time as am@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore , ast@@ ase should not be used together with or@@ ally captured mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am ( see section 4.3 ) while at the same time caution is advised with par@@ enter@@ al mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
data for the simultaneous use of par@@ enter@@ al Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am with other prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors indicate a possible increase in the plasma gas of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am for 3 to 4 times .
&quot; when meth@@ ad@@ one is administered together with ammon@@ avi@@ r , patients should therefore be monitored for pi@@ racy symptoms , especially if there are also low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r administered . &quot;
&quot; because of the low reliability of historical compar@@ isons , there is currently no recommendation on how to adjust the pren@@ atal dose when amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r is administered simultaneously with meth@@ ad@@ one . &quot;
increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended for the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) at the same time as a combination of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; the effect of an additional dose of rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on hormon@@ al contrac@@ ep@@ tive contrac@@ tions is not predictable , so alternative methods for contrac@@ eption are also recommended . &quot;
careful monitoring of the therapeutic effects and side effects of tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants ( for example Des@@ i@@ pra@@ mine and Nor@@ tr@@ yp@@ ti@@ lin ) is recommended at the same time ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tation rats , amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study on gravi@@ d rats , which was given by the introduction into the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in the 12 body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
further development of offspring including fertility and reproductive ability was not affected by the administration of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r to the mother animal .
&quot; in adults and children aged 4 and over , the harm@@ lessness of am@@ gener@@ ase was studied in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; the side effects associated with the A@@ gen@@ ase treatment were slightly up to moderate , and rose early and rarely led to the termination of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are used in connection with the intake of as@@ under or another medicine used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; most of the side effects below stem from two clinical trials ( PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 1 , PRO@@ AB@@ 300@@ 6 ) , in which patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors did not receive 200 mg of as@@ ol@@ ase twice daily . &quot;
&quot; events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) , which were evaluated by the investig@@ ators as listed in connection with study medication and performed in more than 1 % of the patients , as well as laboratory changes occurring in the treatment ( Grade 3 to 4 ) . &quot;
&quot; anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy was associated with re@@ distribution of the body fat ( li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy ) in HIV patients , including a loss of peripheral and differential sub@@ cut@@ aneous fatty tissue , increased intra@@ abdominal and vis@@ cer@@ al fat tissue , hyper@@ tro@@ phy of the breasts and dor@@ so@@ cereb@@ ral obesity . &quot;
&quot; under 113 anti @-@ retro@@ viral individuals who had been treated with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r in combination with lam@@ i@@ v@@ u@@ dine / zi@@ do@@ v@@ u@@ dine over a mean duration of 36 weeks , only one case ( stit@@ ching ) was observed ( &lt; 1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study PRO@@ AB 300@@ 6 , 2,@@ 45 N@@ R@@ TI@@ s showed 7 cases ( 3 % ) compared to 27 cases ( 11 % ) in 24@@ 1 patients under In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , in combination with various N@@ R@@ TI@@ s over a mean duration of 56 weeks ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; skin r@@ ashes were usually slightly up to moderate , ery@@ them@@ at@@ ous or ma@@ ku@@ lo@@ pap@@ il@@ ous nature , with or without it@@ ching and usually occurred during the second week of treatment and disappeared spontaneously within two weeks without the treatment with amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r had to be canc@@ eled . &quot;
&quot; o@@ ste@@ on@@ ek@@ rose cases were reported in particular in patients with commonly known risk factors , advanced HIV @-@ disease or long @-@ term care of anti@@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) . &quot;
&quot; in HIV @-@ infected patients with severe immune defects , an anti @-@ retro@@ viral combination therapy ( ART ) can develop an inflammatory response to asy@@ mp@@ tom@@ atic or residual opportun@@ istic infections ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients who received 600 mg of am@@ er@@ ase twice daily together with low dose ri@@ de@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) were comparable to the type and frequency of adverse events ( Grade 2 to 4 ) and laboratory changes ( Grade 3 and 4 ) , which were observed in patients who received am@@ er@@ ase together with low dos@@ ed ri@@ de@@ avi@@ r , very often . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient can observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) when necessary , necessary supporting measures must be initiated . &quot;

&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of prolifer@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ e@@ r lies in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M in acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chronic infected cells
the connection between the activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r against HIV @-@ 1 in vitro and the in@@ hibition of HIV @-@ 1 rep@@ lication in humans is not yet defined .
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , mut@@ ations were rarely observed . &quot;
&quot; in sixteen of 4@@ 34 anti@@ retro@@ viral patients who received 700@@ mg of Fos@@ am@@ ul@@ avi@@ r with 100@@ mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily in the study ES@@ S@@ 100@@ 7@@ 32 , a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred up to week 48 , whereby 14 isol@@ ates could be gen@@ otyp@@ ically examined . &quot;
&quot; gen@@ otyp@@ ic analysis of the isol@@ ates of 13 out of 14 children , in which a vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred within the 59 patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors did not occur before untreated patients , showed resistance patterns that were similar to those in adults . &quot;
&quot; L@@ 10@@ F / I / V , V@@ 11@@ I , I@@ 13@@ V , K@@ 20@@ R , V@@ 32@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I , M@@ 46@@ I / M / V , I@@ 54@@ L / M / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , I@@ 85@@ V , L@@ 90@@ M and I@@ 9@@ 3@@ L / M . &quot;
&quot; in the AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 03 trial and its extension AP@@ V@@ 300@@ 05 ( 700 mg Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily : n = 107 ) , patients with vi@@ ro@@ logical failure occurred over 96 weeks , following the following prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors : &quot;
analysis of gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests based on gen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests can be used to estimate the activity of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r or Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates .
&quot; the current ( July 2006 ) AN@@ RS @-@ AC @-@ 11 algorithm for Fos@@ am@@ explo@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r defines resistance as the presence of mut@@ ations V@@ 32@@ I + 14@@ 7@@ a / V , or at least 4 of the following mut@@ ations L@@ 10@@ F / I , L@@ 33@@ F , M@@ 36@@ I , I@@ 8@@ 2@@ A / C / S / V , I@@ 8@@ 4@@ V and L@@ 90@@ M in combination with increased probability of vi@@ ro@@ logical response ( resistance ) . &quot;
&quot; the conclusions regarding the relevance of certain mut@@ ations or mut@@ ation patterns may be subject to changes caused by additional data , and it is recommended to always draw up the current interpretation systems for the analysis of the results of resistance tests . &quot;
&quot; based on phen@@ otyp@@ ic resistance tests , clin@@ ically vali@@ dated phen@@ otyp@@ ic interpretation systems can be used in conjunction with gen@@ otyp@@ ical data for estim@@ ating the activity of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in patients with prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ or resistant isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; companies that distribute diagnostic resistance tests have developed clinical @-@ phen@@ otyp@@ ic cut @-@ offs for F@@ PV / R@@ TV , which can be used to interpret the results of a resistance test . &quot;
&quot; each of these four genetic samples associated with a reduced sensitivity to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r creates a certain cross @-@ resistance to Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , but the sensitivity to In@@ din@@ avi@@ r , nel@@ fin@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r remains generally preserved . &quot;
&quot; there are currently data about cross @-@ resistance between amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r and other prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors for all 4 Fos@@ am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r resistance paths , either alone or in combination with other mut@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of twenty @-@ five anti@@ retro@@ viral patients not pre @-@ treated patients , in which a f@@ os@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 insul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( one of 25 isol@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three of 24 insul@@ ates ) , Dar@@ un@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( three out of 24 insul@@ ates ) , and Ti@@ den@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( four of 24 insul@@ ates ) , appear to be called forth . &quot;
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ on@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resist@@ ence mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a promising therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of A@@ gen@@ ase in combination with Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r 100 mg twice daily is based on the study PRO@@ 300@@ 17 , a random@@ ised open study , in which pre @-@ treated adults treated with a virus ( 600 mg twice daily ) and nucle@@ o@@ side alo@@ ga ( N@@ R@@ TI ) or a standard therapy ( standard of care , SO@@ C ) with a PI , mainly with low dos@@ ed ri@@ de@@ avi@@ r &quot; &quot; oo@@ st@@ ert &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one hundred and sixty @-@ three ( n = 163 ) patients with proven virus sensitivity to am@@ er@@ ase , at least one other PI and at least one N@@ R@@ TI were included in the A of PRO@@ 300@@ 17 . &quot;
&quot; the primary analysis showed the non @-@ superi@@ ority of AP@@ V / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r in comparison with the SO@@ C @-@ PI group in response to the time @-@ ad@@ missible mean change from the initial value ( A@@ AU@@ C@@ MB ) in the virus load ( HIV @-@ 1 RNA ) in the plasma after 16 weeks , with a non @-@ under@@ lay threshold of 0.4 lo@@ 10 copies / ml . &quot;
&quot; the evidence of the efficacy of untreated a@@ gener@@ ase is based on two un@@ controlled studies with a total of 28@@ 8 HIV @-@ infected children aged 2 to 18 , of which 152 were pre @-@ treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; in the studies , intake and capsules were administered three times daily , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg three times a day , 20 mg / kg twice daily , and 2@@ 2.5 mg / kg twice daily , and the majority of patients received 20 mg / kg twice daily . &quot;
no low dos@@ ed ri@@ de@@ avi@@ r was given at the same time ; the majority of patients treated with PI had at least one ( 78 % ) or two ( 42 % ) of the N@@ R@@ TI@@ s administered together with am@@ gener@@ ase .
&quot; after 48 weeks , approximately 25 % of patients enrolled in the study had a plasma @-@ HIV @-@ 1 RNA concentration &lt; 10,000 copies / ml and 9 % &lt; 400 copies / ml with a medi@@ an increase in CD@@ 4 cell count of 26 cells / mm ³ ( n = 74 ) compared to bas@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; 19 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ f@@ oo@@ ster@@ ized &quot; am@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into consideration in the treatment optimisation of the children treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; after oral administration , the mean duration ( t@@ max ) is approximately 1 to 2 hours for the capsule and about 0.5 to 1 hour for the solution . &quot;
&quot; increased 50@@ 8 % , on the other hand , reduced by 30 % for C@@ MA@@ x when Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was administered twice daily with Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the administration of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r with a meal leads to a 25 % decrease in the AU@@ C , but has no effect on the concentration of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r 12 hours after dosage ( C@@ 12 ) . &quot;
&quot; therefore minimal concentration in the Ste@@ ady State ( C@@ min , ss ) was unaffected by the intake of food , although the simultaneous intake of food influences the extent and rate of resor@@ ption . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large distribution volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
&quot; this change leads to a decrease in the total concentration of the active substance in the plasma , whereby the amount of un@@ bound ammon@@ ia , which represents the active part , probably remains unchanged . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound ammon@@ ia remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss . &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be taken with caution when given at the same time with as@@ under ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; the dose of am@@ gener@@ ase capsules , either 20 mg / kg twice or 15 mg / kg three times daily , leads to a similar daily amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r exposure as in adults with a dose of 1200 mg twice daily . &quot;
&quot; aspir@@ avi@@ r is 14 % less bio@@ available from the solution than from the capsules , which is why A@@ ger@@ ase Solution and A@@ cou@@ ture Cap@@ sul@@ es are not re@@ plac@@ eable on a milli@@ gram@@ m@@ basis . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is also neg@@ li@@ gible , therefore the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction is likely to be low on the elimination of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
these treatment schemes lead to am@@ on@@ avi@@ r plasma levels comparable to those with a dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice a day without simultaneous administration of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r .
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ bili@@ ary aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in male animals , corresponding to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans , after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of am@@ pren@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the 21 underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ bili@@ ary aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; this liver toxic@@ ity can be monitored and proven in clinical life through measurement of AST , AL@@ T and the activity of alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; so far , no significant liver toxic@@ ity in patients has been observed in clinical studies , neither during the administration of am@@ er@@ ase after the end of the treatment . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of fry , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor alterations including thy@@ me ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate delayed development . &quot;
&quot; 24 If A@@ generic Cap@@ sul@@ es are used without the ampli@@ fying additive of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( boo@@ ster ) , higher doses of am@@ er@@ ase ( 1200 mg twice daily ) must be applied . &quot;
the recommended dose for am@@ on@@ ase capsules is 20 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight twice a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 24@@ 00 mg Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in patients with severe liver dysfunction , patients with severe liver dysfunction are contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; 26 For some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under review of the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; as@@ under should be removed for duration 27 , if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; increased 50@@ 8 % , while C@@ MA@@ x decreases by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ min values of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r in plasma , which were achieved twice daily with potassium ( 600 mg twice daily ) with potassium ( 400 mg Lop@@ in@@ avi@@ r + 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r twice daily ) , are approximately 40 to 50 % lower than if Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r ( 600 mg twice daily ) is administered twice daily in combination with 100 mg Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; dosage recommendations for the simultaneous administration of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r and Kal@@ et@@ ra cannot be given , however , a close monitoring is recommended as the efficacy and safety of this combination is not known . &quot;
the treatment with E@@ fa@@ vi@@ ren@@ z in combination with Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r and Sa@@ quin@@ avi@@ r is not recommended since the exposure of both prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors would decrease .
&quot; if this medicine is used together , caution is advised ; thorough clinical and vi@@ ro@@ logical monitoring should be undertaken as a precise pre@@ diction of the effect of the combination of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r on Del@@ avi@@ r@@ din is difficult . &quot;
&quot; if it is necessary for clinical reasons to admini@@ ster ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin along with as@@ under , a reduction in the dosage of ri@@ fab@@ u@@ tin will be recommended to at least half of the recommended dose 31 , although no clinical data is available for this . &quot;
&quot; serum concentrations of calcium channel block@@ ers such as am@@ lo@@ di@@ pine , dil@@ ti@@ az@@ em , ri@@ pen@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@ fe@@ di@@ pine , ni@@

increased control of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) is recommended for the possibility of a weak@@ ening or strengthening of the anti@@ thro@@ m@@ bot@@ ic effect ( see section 4.4 ) at the same time as a combination of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; the simultaneous administration of Or@@ tho @-@ Nov@@ um 1 / 35 ( 0,@@ 0@@ 35 mg of eth@@ in@@ yl est@@ radi@@ ol plus 1.0 mg nor@@ eth@@ in@@ ed@@ ron ) led to a decrease in AU@@ C and C@@ min by 22 % respectively . &quot;
&quot; during pregnancy , this drug may be used only after careful weighing of possible benefits for the mother compared to the possible risks for the fet@@ us . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study on gravi@@ d rats , which was given by the introduction into the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a dimin@@ ished increase in body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; in adults and children aged 4 and over , the harm@@ lessness of am@@ gener@@ ase was studied in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the patient can observe signs of an intoxic@@ ation ( see paragraph 4.@@ 8 ) when necessary , necessary supporting measures must be initiated . &quot;
&quot; the anti@@ viral activity of prolifer@@ avi@@ r in vitro against HIV @-@ 1 II@@ I@@ B was studied in acute and chronic lymp@@ ho@@ blas@@ tic cell lines ( MT @-@ 4 , CE@@ M @-@ CC@@ RF , H@@ 9 ) and peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes . &quot;
the 50 % inhibit@@ or concentration ( IC@@ 50 ) of am@@ pren@@ e@@ r lies in the range of 0.@@ 0@@ 12 to 0.@@ 08 µ@@ M at acute infected cells and amounts to 0.@@ 41 µ@@ M in the case of chronic infected cells ( 1 µ@@ M = 0.@@ 50 µ@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; conver@@ sely , am@@ on@@ avi@@ r keeps its activity against some other prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors resistant insul@@ ates ; the preservation of this activity seems to depend on the number and type of resist@@ ence mut@@ ations in the isol@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; based on these data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ f@@ oo@@ ster@@ ized &quot; am@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into consideration in the treatment optimisation with PI pre@@ treated children . &quot;
&quot; while the absolute concentration of un@@ bound ammon@@ ia remains constant , the percentage of the free active component fluctu@@ ates during the dosing interval depending on the total drug concentration in the Ste@@ ady State over the range of C@@ MA@@ x , ss to C@@ min , ss .. &quot;
&quot; therefore , medicines that indu@@ ce or inhi@@ bit C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 or represent a substrate of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 must be taken with caution when given at the same time with as@@ under ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.3 , 4.4 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; also , the ren@@ al clearance of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r is neg@@ li@@ gible ; therefore , the effect of ren@@ al dysfunction may be low on the elimination of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r and Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; in long @-@ term studies on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity of mice and rats , h@@ ep@@ ato@@ bili@@ ary aden@@ omas oc@@ cured in male animals with dos@@ ages which correspon@@ ded to the 2.0 @-@ fold ( mice ) or 3.@@ 8 @-@ fold ( rat ) of exposure to humans after twice daily dose of 1200 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ cel@@ ular aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; the present exposure data on humans , both from clinical trials and therapeutic applications , showed little evidence of the clinical relevance of these findings . &quot;
&quot; in a standard battery of in @-@ vi@@ vo@@ - and in @-@ vitro gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity tests , the bacterial reverse mut@@ ation tests ( Am@@ es Test ) , mouse lymp@@ ho@@ m test , micro@@ kernel test on rats and chromos@@ om@@ al ab@@ err@@ ations in human peripheral lymp@@ ho@@ cytes , Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r was neither mut@@ agen nor gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; studies on the toxic@@ ity of fry , which were treated at an age of 4 days , showed a high mortality in both the control and the animals treated with amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r . &quot;
&quot; these results indicate that in young , the metabolism paths are not fully mature , so that amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r or other critical components of the formulation ( z ) . &quot;
&quot; in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines for the treatment of HIV @-@ 1 @-@ infected , prot@@ e@@ as@@ inhibit@@ ors ( PI ) -@@ pre@@ treated adults and children aged 4 and older . &quot;
&quot; the benefit of having a &quot; &quot; oo@@ ster@@ er &quot; &quot; A@@ generative solution for receiving was neither given to patients who were previously treated with PI or patients who were previously treated with PI . &quot;
&quot; the bio@@ availability of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a solution to intake is 14 % less than from am@@ on@@ avi@@ r as a capsule , therefore , the intake capsules and solution to intake on a milli@@ gram per milli@@ gram basis are not inter@@ changeable ( see paragraph 5.2 ) . &quot;
patients should stop taking the capsules once they are able to stop taking the solution ( see section 4.4 ) .
the recommended dose for am@@ on@@ ase solution is 17 mg ( 1.1 ml ) Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r / kg body weight three times a day in combination with other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines up to a daily dose of 28@@ 00 mg of amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r which should not be exceeded ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in addition , since no dose recommendation can be given for the simultaneous use of A@@ ger@@ ase solution for entry and low dos@@ ed ri@@ de@@ avi@@ r , this combination can be avoided in these patient groups . &quot;
&quot; although dose @-@ adjustment for amp@@ ut@@ avi@@ r is not considered necessary , an application of as@@ under @-@ ase solution for use in patients with kidney failure is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; due to the potential risk of toxic reaction as a result of the high propylene gly@@ col content , A@@ generic @-@ solution is contra@@ indicated for infants and children under 4 years of age , in pregnant women , in patients with reduced liver function or liver failure and in patients with kidney failure . &quot;
simultaneous administration may result in a competitive in@@ hibition of the metabolism of these drugs and potentially cause serious and / or life @-@ threatening side effects such as heart rhythm disorders ( z ) .
patients should be advised that am@@ er@@ ase or any other anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy does not lead to a cure of the HIV infection and that they will continue to develop opportun@@ istic infections or other complications of HIV infection .
&quot; the present anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy , including treatment with am@@ er@@ ase , does not prevent the risk of transmitting HIV to others through sexual contact or contamination with blood . &quot;
&quot; for some medicines that can cause serious or life @-@ threatening side effects such as carb@@ amaz@@ ep@@ ine , phen@@ ob@@ arbit@@ al , phen@@ y@@ to@@ in , tri@@ cy@@ c@@ lic anti@@ depres@@ s@@ ants and war@@ far@@ in ( under review of the International Reg@@ ulated R@@ atio ) , methods for determining the drug concentration are available . &quot;
&quot; as@@ under should be removed in the long run if a rash is accompanied by systemic or allergic symptoms , or the mu@@ cous membranes are involved ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; increased risk of li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy was associated with individual factors , such as higher age , and with drug @-@ 49 dependent factors , such as a longer lasting anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment and related metabolic disorders . &quot;
&quot; in hem@@ ophi@@ lic patients ( type A and B ) , which were treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors , reports of an increase in hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges , including spontaneous cut@@ aneous hem@@ at@@ omas and hem@@ o@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis . &quot;
&quot; it was shown that Ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in causes a 82 % reduction in the AU@@ C of Am@@ ph@@ avi@@ r , which can lead to vi@@ ro@@ logical failure and resistance development . &quot;
&quot; increased 50@@ 8 % , while C@@ MA@@ x decreases by 30 % , if Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( 100 mg twice daily ) was given in combination with am@@ on@@ avi@@ r capsules ( 600 mg twice daily ) . &quot;
&quot; the con@@ current intake of as@@ under can considerably increase its plasma concentrations and increase side effects with P@@ DE@@ 5 inhibit@@ ors including hyp@@ ot@@ en@@ sion , visual disturbances and pri@@ ap@@ ism ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; based on the data on 54 other C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors , significantly higher plasma concentrations of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am are expected after oral administration of Mi@@ da@@ z@@ ol@@ am . &quot;
the potential risk for humans is not known . a solution to intake may not be applied during pregnancy due to possible toxic reactions of the fet@@ us ( see section 4.3 ) .
&quot; in the milk lac@@ tation rats , amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ related substances have been detected , but it is not known whether amp@@ on@@ avi@@ r is transferred to breast milk in humans . &quot;
&quot; a reproduction study on gravi@@ d rats , which was given by the introduction into the uter@@ us up to the end of the lac@@ tation period , showed a reduced increase in 55 body weight during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; in adults and children aged 4 and over , the harm@@ lessness of am@@ gener@@ ase was studied in controlled clinical trials in combination with various other anti@@ retro@@ viral medicines . &quot;
&quot; in many of these events , it is not clear whether they are used in connection with the intake of as@@ under or another medicine used for HIV treatment , or whether they are a consequence of the underlying disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of anti@@ retro@@ viral patients with the currently approved Fos@@ am@@ on@@ avi@@ r / Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r dos@@ ages , as with other Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r @-@ based treatment schemes with prot@@ e@@ as@@ ein@@ inhibit@@ ors , mut@@ ations were rarely observed . &quot;
early abor@@ tion of a se@@ eding 60 therapy is recommended to limit the accumulation of a variety of mut@@ ations which may adver@@ sely affect subsequent treatment .
&quot; 62 Based on this data , the expected benefit of &quot; un@@ f@@ oo@@ ster@@ ized &quot; am@@ gener@@ ase should be taken into consideration in the treatment optimisation of the children treated with PI . &quot;
the apparent distribution volume amounts to approximately 430 l ( 6 l / kg with a body weight of 70 kg ) and can be closed to a large ve@@ to volume as well as an un@@ imp@@ eded penetration of am@@ on@@ avi@@ r from the blood@@ stream into the tissue .
the underlying mechanism for the formation of h@@ ep@@ ato@@ bili@@ ary aden@@ omas and carcin@@ omas has not yet been clari@@ fied and the relevance of these observed effects for humans is unclear .
&quot; in systemic plasma exposure , which was significantly lower ( rab@@ bit ) or not significantly higher ( rats ) than expected exposure under therapeutic dosage in humans , however , a number of minor alterations including thy@@ me ong@@ ation and minor skel@@ etal changes were observed that indicate delayed development . &quot;

the benefit of using Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r &apos;s &quot; oo@@ ster@@ ter &quot; ag@@ ro@@ ster@@ d solution for entry was not covered by patients who were previously treated with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors or with prot@@ ease inhibit@@ ors .
&quot; for the application of low doses of Rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r ( commonly used to ampli@@ fy the effect &#91; boo@@ ster &#93; of am@@ gener@@ ase capsules ) , along with as@@ under solution to intake , no dosage recommendations can be given . &quot;

important information about certain other components of A@@ ger@@ ase solution to take The solution to intake contains propylene gly@@ col which can lead to side effects in high doses .
&quot; propylene gly@@ col can cause a number of side effects including var@@ ic@@ ose attacks , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and reduction of red blood cells ( see also as@@ under are not allowed to be taken , special caution is required when taking a@@ ol@@ ase is required precau@@ tions ) . &quot;

&quot; this can include fat loss on legs , arms , and face , fat loss on the abdom@@ en and in other inner organs , breast enlargement and fat pur@@ ges in the neck ( &quot; &quot; bull &apos;s &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; other ingredients are propylene gly@@ col , mac@@ ro@@ go@@ l 400 ( pol@@ yethylene gly@@ col 400 ) , ac@@ es@@ ul@@ f@@ am potassium , su@@ c@@ rose sodium , sodium chlori@@ de , artificial ch@@ ewing mint flav@@ our@@ ing , cit@@ ric acid , sodium cit@@ rate di@@ ih@@ ydr@@ ate , puri@@ fied water . &quot;
&quot; the application frequency and duration of treatment with al@@ dar@@ a depend on the disease to be treated : • In case of small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas , the cream is to be applied three times a week for six weeks . &quot;
&quot; before bed@@ time , the cream is thin @-@ lay@@ ered on the affected areas of the skin , so that it leaves enough long ( about eight hours ) on the skin before it is washed away . &quot;
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was compared to a placebo ( the same cream , but without the active ingredient ) . • Al@@ dar@@ a was tested in four main studies of 9@@ 23 patients with war@@ ts in the genital area for 16 weeks each . &quot;
&quot; • Al@@ dar@@ a was also studied in 7@@ 24 patients with small bas@@ al cell carcin@@ omas in two studies , in which patients were treated six weeks or five times a week either daily or five times a week . &quot;
• Al@@ dar@@ a was also tested in two studies involving a total of 50@@ 5 patients with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses .
&quot; in all studies , Al@@ dar@@ a was more effective than placebo . • In the treatment of war@@ ts in the genital area , the total treatment rate in all four main studies was 15 % to 52 % in the patients treated with placebo . &quot;
the most common side effects of Al@@ dar@@ a ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are reactions to the application point of the cream ( pain or it@@ ching ) .
&quot; clin@@ ically typical , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses ( A@@ K@@ s ) in the face or on the scal@@ p in immun@@ o@@ competent adults , if the size or number of les@@ ions restrict the efficacy and / or acceptance of cr@@ y@@ otherapy and other topical treatment options are contra@@ indicated or less suitable . &quot;
&quot; Monday , Wednesday and Friday or Tuesday , Thursday and Saturday ) before bed@@ time and leave for 6 to 10 hours on the skin . &quot;
&quot; the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream continues until all visible genital war@@ ts have disappeared in the genital or peri@@ al canal , or up to a maximum of 16 weeks per treatment period . &quot;
an inter@@ ruption in the treatment procedure described above should be considered when intensive local inflammatory reactions occur ( see section 4.4 ) or when an infection is observed in the treatment area .
&quot; if during follow @-@ up examination 4 to 8 weeks after the second treatment period the les@@ ions were only healed completely , another therapy should be initiated ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; if a dose is om@@ itted , the patient should apply the cream as soon as he / she notices this and continue with the usual therapy plan . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream is to be applied in a thin layer and in the clean@@ sed , infected skin area to be rub@@ bed until the cream is fully drawn . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should take place between the benefit of a treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with a possible worsen@@ ing of their auto@@ immune disease . &quot;
&quot; in these patients , it should take place between the benefit of treatment with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od and the risk associated with possible organ rejection or gra@@ ft @-@ versus @-@ host reaction . &quot;
&quot; in other studies , in which no daily pre @-@ auth@@ y@@ gi@@ ene was performed , two cases of severe phi@@ mo@@ sis and one case were observed with one to circumc@@ ision leading stri@@ k@@ tur . &quot;
&quot; when applying I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in higher than recommended doses , there is an increased risk of severe local skin irrit@@ ations ( see section 4.2 . ) In rare cases severe local skin irrit@@ ations have been observed , which necess@@ itated a treatment and / or have led to a temporary physical impair@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; in cases where such reactions occurred at the exit of the ureth@@ ra , some women had difficulty passing urine requiring emergency cath@@ eter@@ isation and treatment of the affected area . &quot;
&quot; for the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream immediately after treatment with other cut@@ aneous remedies for the treatment of external genital war@@ ts in the genital and peripheral area , no clinical experience has yet occurred . &quot;
&quot; although limited data suggest an increased rate of Tamiflu @-@ positive patients , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od @-@ creme has shown less efficacy in this group of patients regarding the removal of the inclin@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; treatment of bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma with i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od within 1 cm around the ey@@ eli@@ ds , nose , lips , or hair@@ line was not examined . &quot;
local skin reactions are common but the intensity of these reactions generally decreases during therapy or the reactions form after completion of the treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if it is necessary due to the patient &apos;s discomfort or due to the severity of local skin reactions , a treatment interval of several days may be made . &quot;
the clinical outcome of the therapy may be judged after the regeneration of the treated skin approximately 12 weeks after the end of the treatment .
&quot; as currently no data on long @-@ term healing rates of more than 36 months after the treatment is available , other appropriate therapy forms should be considered in super@@ fici@@ al cell carcin@@ omas . &quot;
&quot; in patients with recur@@ rent and pre@@ treated BC@@ Cs , no clinical experience is present , therefore the application is not recommended in pre @-@ treated tum@@ ors . &quot;
data from an open clinical trial suggest that large tum@@ ors ( &gt; 7.@@ 25 c@@ m2 ) have a lower probability of response to I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od therapy .
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od was not examined for treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses on ey@@ eli@@ ds , inside the nose or in the ears or on the lip area within the lip@@ id . &quot;
there are only very limited data on the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ oses in anatom@@ ical places outside of the face and scal@@ p .
&quot; the available data on ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose on the lower arms and hands does not support effectiveness in this application , therefore such an application is not recommended . &quot;
local skin reactions occur frequently but these reactions normally decrease in the course of therapy to intensity or go back after stopping the therapy with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream .
&quot; if local skin reactions cause severe discomfort or are very strong for the patient , treatment may be suspended for a few days . &quot;
the data from an open clinical study shows that patients with more than 8 files showed a lower total healing rate than patients with less than 8 les@@ ions .
&quot; due to the immun@@ o @-@ stimulating properties , I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream should be used with caution in patients receiving immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive treatment ( see 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; animal studies do not show any direct or indirect harmful effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; although there are no quanti@@ fiable serum levels ( &gt; 5@@ n@@ g / ml ) , neither after a one @-@ time nor after multiple topical application , no recommendation can be given during the lac@@ tation period . &quot;
the most frequent contribut@@ ors and probably or possibly with the application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects in the trials with three weeks of treatment were local reactions at the site of treatment of the genital war@@ ts ( 3@@ 3.@@ 7 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) .
adverse events reported most frequently and probably or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream related side effects include discomfort on the application site with a frequency of 28.@@ 1 % .
the side effects reported by 185 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream from a placebo @-@ controlled phase III clinical trial are shown below .
&quot; the most common , probably , or possibly with the application of the I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream in relation to the side effect , were in these studies a response to the application location ( 22 % of patients treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od ) . &quot;
side effects reported by 25@@ 2 in placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials of phase III with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream were listed below .
&quot; according to the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan , this placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream frequently came to local skin reactions including Er@@ y@@ them@@ ( 61 % ) , erosion ( 30 % ) , ex@@ cre@@ ation / leaves / sli@@ ppers ( 23 % ) and o@@ ede@@ ma ( 14 % ) ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; according to the clinical evidence assessed according to the test plan , it is very common in these studies with five times weekly treatment with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream very often to severe ery@@ thema ( 31 % ) , severe ero@@ sions ( 13 % ) , and severe scar@@ ring ( 19 % ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials investigating the application of i@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od for the treatment of ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose , al@@ op@@ eci@@ a was diagnosed with a frequency of 0.4 % ( 5 / 12@@ 14 ) at the treatment centre or surrounding area . &quot;
&quot; the accidental unique oral intake of 200 mg I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , which corresponds to the content of approximately 16 bags , could lead to nausea , vom@@ iting , headache , my@@ al@@ gia and fever . &quot;
&quot; the clin@@ ically serious side effect , which occurred after several oral doses of &gt; 200 mg , consisted of hyp@@ ot@@ onia norm@@ alized after or@@ aler or intraven@@ ous fluid . &quot;
&quot; in a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic investigation , systemic concentrations of alpha interfer@@ ons and other cy@@ tok@@ ines were detected after the topical application of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od . &quot;
&quot; in 3 pi@@ vot@@ al Phase 3 efficacy studies , efficacy with regard to a complete healing of the genital war@@ ts is clearly superior in I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treatment over 16 weeks of placebo treatment . &quot;
&quot; at 60 % of the 119 patients who were treated with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od , patients were completely healed ; this was the case with 20 % of the 105 patients who had been treated with placebo ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; complete healing could be achieved at 23 % of 157 with I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od treated male patients , compared to 5 % of 161 treated male patients ( 95 % CI ) : &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in five @-@ week use per week over 6 weeks was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical trials . &quot;
the target tum@@ ors were hist@@ ologically confirmed single primary super@@ fici@@ al cell carcin@@ omas with a minimum size of 0.5 c@@ m2 and a maximum diameter of 2 cm .
&quot; the data presented from an open , un@@ controlled long @-@ term study after four years showed that around 7@@ 9.@@ 3 % &#91; 95 % CI ( 7@@ 3.@@ 7 % , 8@@ 4.@@ 9 % ) &#93; were clin@@ ically cured and this remained for 48 months . &quot;
&quot; I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od &apos;s efficacy in three weeks of treatment in one or two treatment periods of 4 weeks , interrupted by a four @-@ week treatment @-@ free period , was examined in two double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled clinical studies . &quot;
&quot; the patients had clin@@ ically typical , visible , dis@@ crete , non @-@ hyper@@ trop@@ hic ac@@ - les@@ ions within a con@@ ti@@ gu@@ ous 25 c@@ m2 treatment area on the uncomfortable scal@@ p or in the face . &quot;
the one @-@ year data from two combined monitoring studies show a recur@@ rence rate of 27 % ( 35 / 128 patients ) for patients with clinical healing after one or two treatment periods .
&quot; the approved indications external gra@@ dient ni@@ p@@ ples , ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose and super@@ fici@@ ent bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma do not usually appear in pa@@ edi@@ atric patients and were therefore not examined . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ dar@@ a Creme is studied in four random@@ ised , double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled studies of children aged 2 to 15 with M@@ oll@@ us@@ cum con@@ ta@@ gi@@ os@@ um ( I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od n = 5@@ 76 , placebo n = 3@@ 13 ) . &quot;
the efficacy of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od could not be shown in these studies in the doses investigated there ( 3@@ x / week for a period of ≤ 16 weeks or months ) .
minimal systemic absorption of the 5 % I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od cream through the skin of 58 patients with ac@@ tin ker@@ at@@ ose was observed in the three weeks weekly application during 16 weeks .
&quot; the highest concentrations in serum at the end of the week 16 were observed between 9 and 12 hours and were 0.1 , 0.2 and 1.6 n@@ g / ml in the face ( 12.@@ 5 mg , 1 disposable bag ) , on the scal@@ p ( 25 mg , 2 bags ) and on the hands / arms ( 75 mg , 6 bags ) . &quot;
the calculated obvious half @-@ value time was about 10 times higher than the 2 @-@ hour half @-@ life after the sub@@ cut@@ aneous use in an earlier study ; this indicates an extended retention of the medicine in the skin .
the data on systemic exposure showed that the absorption of I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od after topical application on MC @-@ dise@@ ased skin of patients aged 6 @-@ 12 years was low and comparable to that in healthy adults and adults with ac@@ tin@@ ic ker@@ at@@ ose or super@@ normal bas@@ al cell carcin@@ oma .
&quot; in a four @-@ month study on der@@ mal toxic@@ ity at rat , doses of 0.5 and 2.5 mg / kg KG lead to significantly reduced body weight and increased sp@@ le@@ en weight ; a study carried out for four months resulted in no similar effects with the mouse . &quot;
a two year study on carcin@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity in mice on three days per week did not indu@@ ce tumours in the application .
&quot; the appropriate mechanism is not known , but because I@@ mi@@ qu@@ im@@ od has only a low systemic absorption from the human skin and is not mut@@ ant , a risk for humans is regarded as very low due to systemic exposure . &quot;
&quot; tum@@ ors oc@@ cured in the group of mice treated with the active free cream , earlier and in greater numbers than in the control group with low U@@ VR . &quot;

tell your doctor / health care professional or pharmac@@ ist immediately if you don &apos;t feel comfortable while using Al@@ dar@@ a cream .
&quot; if your skin re@@ acts too strongly to the treatment with Al@@ dar@@ a Creme , you should not use the cream further , wash the affected skin area with water and a mild soap and communicate your doctor or pharmac@@ ist . &quot;
a reduced number of blood cells can make you more suscep@@ tible to infections ; it can cause you to quickly create a blue stain or you can cause fatigue .
inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will significantly affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information information .
&quot; in addition , you can feel it@@ ching ( 32 % of patients ) , burning ( 26 % of patients ) or pain in the areas you have applied to Al@@ dar@@ a cream ( 8 % of patients ) . &quot;
&quot; most of these are lighter skin reactions , which end up again within 2 weeks after the treatment is completed . &quot;
&quot; occasionally some patients notice changes at the application location ( wound secre@@ tion , inflammation , swelling , scar@@ ring , der@@ mati@@ tis ) or irrit@@ ability , nausea , dry mouth , flu @-@ like symptoms and fatigue . &quot;

al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is used for enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I ; α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat the non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( the symptoms that are not related to brain or nerve ) .
&quot; this means that certain substances ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans , g@@ ags ) are not broken down and thus accumulate in most organs in the body and damage them . &quot;
&quot; following non @-@ neuro@@ logical symptoms of the M@@ PS I can occur : enlarged liver , stiff joints , the movements difficult , decreased lung volume , cardiac and eye diseases . &quot;
the treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be monitored by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic disorders .
&quot; the administration of Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should take place in a hospital or clinic with re@@ vit@@ ational devices , and patients may need medicines to prevent an allergic reaction . &quot;

&quot; the study mainly examined the safety of the drug , but its effectiveness has also been measured ( by examining its effect on reducing G@@ AG concentrations in urine and in relation to the size of the liver ) . &quot;
&quot; in children under five years , Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me lowered the G@@ AG concentrations in the urine by about 60 % , and half of the children treated showed a normal large liver at the end of the study . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients aged over five years ( observed in more than 1 of 10 patients ) are headache , nausea , abdominal pain , rash , ar@@ th@@ rop@@ athy ( joint pain ) , back pain , pain in limbs ( in hands and feet ) , heat sensation , fever and reactions at the in@@ fusion site . &quot;
&quot; very common side effects in patients less than five years are elevated blood pressure , decreased oxygen satur@@ ation ( a measurement size of lung function ) , t@@ ach@@ y@@ car@@ dia ( accelerated heart rate ) , fever and ch@@ ills . &quot;
al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase or any of the other components ( an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ ic reaction ) .
&quot; every year , the European Medic@@ ines Agency ( E@@ MEA ) will review all new information that may be disclosed and where necessary update this summary . &quot;
the manufacturer of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me will observe patients who receive al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me regarding reactions to in@@ fusion and development of antibodies .
&quot; in June 2003 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Gen@@ zy@@ me Europe B.V. to appro@@ ve Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is a re@@ combin@@ ant form of human α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase and is produced using re@@ combin@@ ant DNA technology using CH@@ O mam@@ mal cell cultures ( Chinese ham@@ ster O@@ vary , derived from the Chinese ham@@ ster ) . &quot;
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me is indicated for long @-@ term enzyme replacement therapy in patients with assured diagnosis of a Mu@@ cop@@ ol@@ ys@@ ac@@ chari@@ dosis I ( M@@ PS I , α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase deficiency ) to treat non @-@ neuro@@ logical manifestations of the disease ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should be carried out by a doctor who has experience in the treatment of patients with M@@ PS I or other her@@ edi@@ tary metabolic diseases .
the initial in@@ fusion rate of 2 E / kg / h can be increased every 15 minutes in individual steps to a maximum dose of 43 E / kg / h .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in adults over 65 years has not been determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me in patients with kidney or liver failure was not determined and no dosing schedule can be recommended for these patients .
patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me can develop in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions which are defined as any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; for this reason , especially these patients should continue to be closely monitored and the in@@ fusion of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should only be carried out in an appropriate clinical environment where re@@ vit@@ ational facilities for medical emer@@ gen@@ cies are immediately available . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the clinical phase 3 study , nearly all patients with Ig@@ G antibodies against Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase are usually within 3 months from the beginning of the treatment . &quot;
patients who develop antibodies or symptoms of in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction must be treated with caution when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms ( see Sec@@ tions 4.3 and 4.@@ 8 ) .
&quot; as little experience exists regarding resum@@ ption of treatment after a long break , the risk of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions must be cau@@ ti@@ ously cau@@ tious after an inter@@ ruption of treatment . &quot;
treat 60 minutes before the start of in@@ fusion with medication ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and / or anti@@ py@@ ri@@ cular ) in order to minimize the potential occurrence of in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions .
&quot; in case of mild or moderate in@@ fusion reactions , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ines and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen should be considered and / or a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to half of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a single , severe in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction the in@@ fusion must be stopped until symptoms decrease , treatment with anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen is to be considered . &quot;
in@@ fusion can be resum@@ ed with a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the reaction occurred .
3 ( anti@@ hist@@ am@@ ini@@ ka and par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol / i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and / or cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ) as well as a reduction of in@@ fusion rate to 1 / 2 - 1 / 4 of the in@@ fusion rate in which the previous response has occurred .
&quot; al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me should not be used simultaneously with chlor@@ o@@ qu@@ in or proc@@ aine , because there is a potential risk of interference with the in@@ trac@@ ell@@ ular reception of larv@@ ae oxid@@ ase . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies do not allow direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth and post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; since no data on new@@ bor@@ ns , which were exposed to breast milk over breast milk , is recommended not to breast@@ feed during treatment with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; adverse events in clinical trials were mainly classified as in@@ fusion @-@ related reactions , which were observed in 53 % of patients in the Phase 3 study ( treatment duration of up to 4 years ) and 35 % of patients in the study with participants under 5 years ( duration of treatment up to 1 year ) . &quot;
adverse drug reactions in connection with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me observed during the Phase 3 study and their extension in a total of 45 patients at the age of 5 years or older for a duration of up to 4 years are reported in the following table : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 to &lt; 1 / 10 ) .
&quot; in some patients with severe M@@ PS @-@ I @-@ related involvement of the upper respiratory tract and lungs in the pre@@ history , severe reactions occurred , including bron@@ ch@@ os@@ pas@@ m , respiratory level and facial oil ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; children Un@@ desirable drug effects associated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , which were reported during a phase 2 study with a total of 20 patients at the age of 5 , with predominantly severe form and treatment duration of up to 12 months , are reported in the table . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 mg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 mg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; in most patients , a ser@@ o@@ con@@ version occurred within 3 months after the beginning of the treatment , whereby the patients at the age of 5 were mostly within a month to form a serum version ( on average after 26 days compared to 45 days in patients aged 5 and older ) . &quot;
&quot; until the end of the Phase 3 study ( or until early ex@@ cre@@ tion from the study ) , there were no antibodies that were det@@ ectable by radio@@ immun@@ op@@ ha@@ cip@@ itation ( R@@ IP ) as@@ say , including 3 patients , in which there was never a serum version . &quot;
patients with low to low antibody levels showed a robust reduction in the G@@ AG @-@ mirror in the urine while in patients with high antibody ti@@ ters a variable reduction of G@@ AG in the urine was determined .
four patients ( three in phase 3 study and one in phase 2 study ) showed a marginal to low neutr@@ alizing inhibit@@ ory effect on enz@@ ym@@ atic larv@@ ae activity in vitro which did not seem to affect clinical efficacy and / or reduction of G@@ AG in the urine .
&quot; the presence of antibodies did not appear to be related to the incidence of un@@ desirable drug reactions , even if the incidence of adverse drug reactions typically coinci@@ ded with the formation of Ig@@ G antibodies . &quot;
the ration@@ ale for the replacement therapy lies in one for the hydro@@ ly@@ sis of the accumulated sub @-@ str@@ atum and the prevention of further accumulation of sufficient restoration of enzyme activity .
&quot; after intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion , Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase is rapidly removed from the circulation and absorbed by cells into the ly@@ s@@ os@@ omes , most likely via man@@ nose @-@ 6 phosph@@ ate recept@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; the safety and efficacy of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in a random@@ ised , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled Phase 3 study to 45 patients aged 6 to 43 years . &quot;
&quot; although patients were recru@@ ited for the study , which showed the entire disease spectrum , the majority of patients from the middle phen@@ otype and only one patient showed the severe phen@@ otype . &quot;
patients were recru@@ ited if they had a forced exp@@ ir@@ atory volume ( FE@@ V ) of less than 80 % of the expected value and they had to be able to stand 6 minutes and walk 5 meters .
the primary end@@ points for the efficacy were the percentage change of the expected FE@@ V and the total distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test .
&quot; all patients were subsequently recru@@ ited for an open @-@ label extension study , where they received 100 E / kg Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me for another 3.5 years ( 18@@ 2 weeks ) each week . &quot;
&quot; after 26 weeks of therapy , patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me showed an improvement in lung function and the ability to respond in the following table . &quot;
the open extension study showed an improvement and / or maintenance of these effects of up to 20@@ 8 weeks in the Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group and from 18@@ 2 weeks in the placebo / Al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me group as shown in the following table .
the decrease in the expected percentage of FE@@ V is not clin@@ ically significant over this period and the absolute pul@@ mon@@ ary volumes increased further propor@@ tionally to the body size of growing children .
&quot; of the 26 patients with a H@@ ep@@ Atom@@ eg@@ aly before treatment , 22 ( 85 % ) reached normal liver size until the end of the study . &quot;
within the first 4 weeks a significant decrease of the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine ( µ@@ g / mg of cre@@ atine ) was determined that remained constant until the end of the study .
&quot; in terms of the hetero@@ geneous disease manifestation among patients receiving clin@@ ically significant changes across five efficacy @-@ variables ( expected percentage normal FE@@ V , distance in the 6 @-@ minute hearing test , range of shoulder joint A@@ HI and visual acuity ) , there was generally an improvement in 10 patients ( 22 % ) and a deterioration in 9 patients ( 20 % ) . &quot;
a one @-@ year open phase 2 study was conducted in which the safety and pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tics of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me were examined in 20 patients who were under 5 years old at the time of their admission ( 16 patients with severe form and 4 with the mean follow @-@ up form ) .
in four patients the dosage was increased to 200 E / kg due to increased G@@ ag@@ - levels in urine in week 22 in the last 26 weeks .
&quot; in several patients a size growth ( n = 7 ) and a weight gain ( n = 3 ) were determined after the Z @-@ S@@ core for this age group The younger patients with the severe form of displacement ( &lt; 2,5 years ) and all 4 patients with the mean follow @-@ up form showed a normal mental development rate , whereas in the elderly patients with severe form of exp@@ ir@@ ation were only limited or no progress in cognitive development . &quot;
&quot; in a phase 4 study , studies on pharmac@@ o@@ dynamic effects of various al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me dosage regi@@ mens were performed on the G@@ AG @-@ Spiegel in the urine , the liver volume and the 6 @-@ minute hearing test . &quot;
&quot; 100 E / kg intraven@@ ously once a week ( recommended dose ) , 200 mg intraven@@ ously once a week , 200 mg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks or 300 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks . &quot;
&quot; the dosage schedule with 200 E / kg intraven@@ ously every 2 weeks can represent an acceptable alternative in patients who have difficulties with weekly in@@ fu@@ sions ; however , it is not proven that the long @-@ term clinical efficacy of these two dosage schemes is equivalent . &quot;

&quot; within the given time , the holder of the permit for placing on the market has completed the following program , whose results form the basis for the annual evaluation report for the benefit @-@ risk ratio . &quot;
&quot; this register will include long @-@ term safety and efficacy information on patients treated with al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , as well as data on the natural progression of the disease in patients without this treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients suffering from M@@ PS I , there is an enzyme called α -@@ L @-@ I@@ dur@@ on@@ id@@ ase that breaks down certain substances in the body ( gly@@ cos@@ am@@ ino@@ gly@@ cans ) , either in a small amount or this enzyme is missing completely . &quot;
&quot; if you are allergic ( hyper@@ sensitive ) to one of the ingredients of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me , or if you have encountered a severe allergic reaction to Lar@@ on@@ id@@ ase . &quot;
in@@ fusion @-@ related reaction is any side effect that occurs during in@@ fusion or until the end of the in@@ fusion @-@ day ( see section 4 &quot; Which side effects are possible &quot; ) .
&quot; when using al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me with other medicines please inform your doctor if you take medicines that contain chlor@@ o@@ quin@@ ine or proc@@ aine , because there is a possible risk of a dimin@@ ished effect of al@@ dur@@ az@@ y@@ me . &quot;
&quot; please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken , including non @-@ prescription medicines . &quot;

&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( another medicine against cancer ) in patients who have not yet received chemotherapy ( medicines for cancer ) and &quot; mal@@ ig@@ ne &quot; ( malign@@ ant , cancer has already spread to other parts of the body ) and is likely to easily spread to other parts of the body . &quot;
&quot; A@@ lim@@ ta is used for patients who have not been treated before , in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and in patients who have previously received other chem@@ otherap@@ ies than chemotherapy alone . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce side effects , patients should take a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid as well as fo@@ lic acid ( a vitamin ) during treatment with A@@ lim@@ ta and receive inj@@ ections of vitamin B@@ 12 . &quot;
&quot; if A@@ lim@@ ta is administered together with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , an &quot; &quot; anti@@ em@@ etic &quot; &quot; ( drugs for vom@@ iting ) and fluids ( to prevent a liquid deficiency ) should be given before or after the administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose blood pattern changes or where certain other side effects occur , the treatment should be delayed , removed or the dose is reduced . &quot;
the active form of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed thus slow@@ s the formation of DNA and RNA and prevents the cells from sharing .
&quot; the transformation of P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into its active form goes more easily in cancer cells than in healthy cells , leading to higher concentrations of the active form of the drug and a longer active duration in cancer cells . &quot;
&quot; for the treatment of the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma , A@@ lim@@ ta was examined in a major study of 4@@ 56 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for their disease . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of non @-@ small cell lung cancer , the effects of A@@ lim@@ ta in a study were compared to 5@@ 71 patients with a local advanced or metastatic disease previously treated with chemotherapy , with the effects of doc@@ et@@ axel ( another medicine against cancer ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , A@@ lim@@ ta was compared with gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine ( another medicine against cancer ) , both in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin in one 7@@ 25 patients who had previously not received chemotherapy for lung cancer . &quot;
patients treated with A@@ lim@@ ta and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin survived an average of 12.@@ 1 months compared to 9.@@ 3 months in the all@@ u@@ vial administration of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin .
patients who had previously received chemotherapy was the average survival time with A@@ lim@@ ta 8.3 months compared to 7.@@ 9 months in doc@@ et@@ axel .
&quot; in both studies , however , patients in which the cancer did not attack the squ@@ am@@ ous cell cells during the administration of A@@ lim@@ ta showed longer survival times than with the equivalent drug . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Eli Lil@@ ly Ne@@ der@@ land B.V. to author@@ ise the transport of A@@ lim@@ ta in the entire European Union . &quot;
each bottle must be dissolved with 4.2 ml 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) which results in a resolution of 25 mg / ml .
the corresponding volume of the necessary dosage is taken from the flow bottle and dil@@ uted with 0.@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) to 100 ml ( see section 6.@@ 6 ) .
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is shown in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for first @-@ line treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic non @-@ small , non @-@ small bron@@ chi@@ al cell carcin@@ oma ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in Mon@@ otherapy is indicated for the treatment in second @-@ line treatment of patients with loc@@ us , advanced or metastatic non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma except for predomin@@ ant disk @-@ epitheli@@ al hist@@ ology ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² of body surface ( KO@@ F ) is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a 10 @-@ minute period of every 21 day treatment cycle .
the recommended dose of c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin is 75 mg / m ² KO@@ F as an in@@ fusion over a period of 2 hours around 30 minutes after completion of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - in@@ fusion on the first day each 21 day treatment cycle .
&quot; in patients with non @-@ small cell carcin@@ oma after previous chemotherapy , the recommended dose of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA 500 mg / m ² KO@@ F is administered intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion over a period of 10 minutes on the first day of every 21 day treatment cycle . &quot;
&quot; to reduce the frequency and severity of skin reactions , a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oid should be given the day before and on the day of the p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed administration and the day after the treatment . &quot;
&quot; during the seven days before the first dose of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , at least 5 doses of fo@@ lic acid must be taken and the intake must be continued throughout the therapy period as well as for another 21 days after the last p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ x@@ ed@@ - dose . &quot;
patients also need to receive an intra@@ muscular injection of vitamin B@@ 12 ( 1000 mc@@ g ) in the week before the first p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed dose and after each third action cycle .
&quot; in patients receiving P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , a complete blood pattern should be created before each administration , including a differentiation of leu@@ ko@@ cytes and a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te count . &quot;
&quot; alkal@@ ine phosph@@ at@@ ase ( AP ) , as@@ part@@ ate trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AST or S@@ GO@@ T ) and al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( AL@@ T or S@@ G@@ PT ) should be ≤ 3 times the upper limit value . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of a new treatment cycle , a dose review must take place taking account of the N@@ adi@@ r of the blood sample or the maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of the previous therapy cycles . &quot;
&quot; after the recovery , patients must be treated according to the indications in tables 1 , 2 and 3 , which are suitable for A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA as mon@@ otherapy or in combination with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
these criteria are based on the definition of the National Cancer Institute Common Tox@@ ic@@ ity C@@ riteri@@ a ( C@@ TC v@@ 2.0 ; N@@ CI 1998 ) ≥ C@@ TC degree 2 bleeding .
&quot; should patients develop non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity ≥ grade 3 ( except neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity ) , the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be interrupted until the patient has the value before the treatment &quot;
the treatment with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA must be canc@@ eled if a hem@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity degree 3 or 4 occurs in patients after 2 dose @-@ reduc@@ ti@@ o- or non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity of Grade 3 or 4 neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity .
&quot; clinical studies showed no indication that patients aged 65 years old or older , compared to patients aged 65 years old , have an increased side effect risk . &quot;
A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA is not recommended for use in children under the age of 18 due to insufficient data on safety and efficacy .
&quot; in clinical trials , no dose adjustments were necessary in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of ≥ 45 ml / min , which go beyond the dose adap@@ tations recommended for all patients . &quot;
the data situation in patients with a Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance of less than 45 ml / min was not sufficient ; therefore the application is not recommended ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; however , patients with a liver function restriction of &gt; the 1.5 @-@ fold of the upper bili@@ ru@@ bin limit and / or trans@@ amin@@ ase values of &gt; the 3.0 @-@ fold of the upper limit value ( in the presence of liver metast@@ ases ) were not studied especially in studies . &quot;
&quot; patients must be monitored with regard to bone @-@ bone resor@@ ting , and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be given to patients before their absolute neut@@ ro@@ ph@@ ils return a value of ≥ 1500 cells / mm ³ and the thro@@ m@@ bo@@ - cy@@ te number again a value of ≥ 100,000 cells / mm ³ . &quot;
&quot; dose @-@ reduction for further cycles is based on the N@@ adi@@ r of absolute neut@@ ro@@ logy , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te number and maximum non @-@ ha@@ em@@ at@@ ological toxic@@ ity as observed in previous treatment cycles ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
&quot; a lower toxic@@ ity and a reduction of Grade 3 / 4 hem@@ at@@ ological and non @-@ ab@@ at@@ ologic toxic@@ ity , such as neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia , f@@ eb@@ ri@@ le neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia and infection with grade 3 / 4 neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia was observed when pre @-@ treatment with fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 occurred . &quot;
&quot; therefore , all treated patients need to be instructed to use fo@@ lic acid and vitamin B@@ 12 as a proph@@ yl@@ actic measure to reduce treatment @-@ related toxic@@ ity ( see section 4.2 ) . &quot;
patients with mild to medium ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 45 to 79 ml / min ) must avoid the simultaneous consumption of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s ) such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen and acet@@ yl@@ sali@@ va ( &gt; 1.3 g daily ) for at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; all patients , intended for therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , must avoid taking N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life for at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; many patients in which these events occurred had appropriate risk factors for the occurrence of ren@@ al events , including de@@ hydr@@ ation , pre @-@ existing hyper@@ tension or diabetes . &quot;
&quot; in patients with clin@@ ically significant fluid accumulation in the trans@@ cellular space , a drainage of the eff@@ usion is to be contem@@ plated before p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot;
&quot; 5 major cardiovascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events were reported in clinical trials with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed occasionally , if this substance was usually given in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the simultaneous use of atten@@ u@@ ated live vacc@@ ines ( except yellow fever , this vacc@@ ination is contra@@ indicated ) is not recommended ( see section 4.3 and 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible pe@@ eling of reproductive @-@ ability by p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , males should be advised to obtain advice regarding the preservation of sperm . &quot;
&quot; in patients with normal ren@@ al function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) high doses of non@@ ster@@ oidal anti@@ ph@@ log@@ isti@@ ca ( N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s , such as i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen &gt; 1600 mg / day ) and acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses ( ≥ 1.3 g daily ) can result in reduced p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed separation with the consequence of an increased occurrence of side effects . &quot;
caution is therefore advised to use high doses of N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s or A@@ ce@@ - t@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses in patients with normal kidney function ( Cre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance ≥ 80 ml / min ) .
&quot; i@@ bu@@ pro@@ fen ) or acet@@ yl@@ sal@@ ic@@ y@@ lic acid in high doses for at least 2 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; as no data is available with regard to the interaction potential with N@@ SA@@ ID@@ s with long half @-@ life such as Pi@@ ro@@ x@@ x@@ ic@@ am or R@@ of@@ ec@@ oxi@@ b , the simultaneous use with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed must be avoided at least 5 days before therapy , on the day of therapy and at least 2 days after therapy with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed . &quot;
the large in@@ tra @-@ individual vari@@ ability of the coag@@ ulation status during the disease and the possibility of interactions between oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants and ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic chemotherapy requires an increased monitoring frequency of IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) when the decision was made to treat the patient with oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants .
&quot; there are no data for the use of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in pregnant women , but as with an@@ de@@ - and an@@ tim@@ etab@@ ol@@ ites severe birth defects are expected in an application during pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed should not be used during pregnancy , unless it is mandatory and after careful weighing of benefits for both the mother and the risk for fet@@ us ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; since the possibility of irre@@ ver@@ sible damage to reproductive capacity is due to p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , men should be advised prior to the beginning of the treatment to obtain advice regarding the prevention of sperm . &quot;
it is not known whether P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed into breast milk and unwanted effects in the breast@@ fed baby cannot be ruled out .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects reported in &gt; 5 % of 168 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma and random@@ ised C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and 163 patients with mes@@ othel@@ i@@ oma who were random@@ ised to receive c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin as mon@@ otherapy .
&quot; frequency : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 and &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 and &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , very rare ( &lt; 1 / 10 ) and not known ( based on available data of spontaneous reports ) . &quot;

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was fixed with respect to the inclusion of all events in which the report doctor held a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients who received random@@ ized c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , included ar@@ rhyth@@ mia and motor neu@@ rop@@ athy . &quot;

&quot; clin@@ ically relevant C@@ TC toxic@@ ity , which were reported at &lt; 1 % ( occasionally ) of the patients receiving random@@ ised p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , included su@@ pra@@ v@@ entri@@ cular ar@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the clinical relevant laboratory toxic@@ ity Level 3 and 4 was similar to phase 2 of three single p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed @-@ mon@@ otherapy studies ( n = 164 ) , except neut@@ rop@@ en@@ ia ( 12.@@ 8 % compared to 5.3 % ) and an increase in al@@ anine @-@ trans@@ amin@@ ase ( 15.@@ 2 % compared to 1.9 % ) . &quot;
these differences are likely to result in differences in the patient population as the pha@@ k@@ se 2 studies both chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ve and clearly pre @-@ treated breast cancer patients with existing liver metast@@ ases and / or abnormal starting values of liver function tests .
the following table shows the frequency and severity of adverse effects that could potentially be related to study medication ; they were reported in &gt; 5 % of 8@@ 39 patients with NSC@@ LC who were random@@ ised to receive random@@ ised c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine .

&quot; for this table , a threshold of 5 % was determined for the inclusion of all events in which the report doctor held a connection with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed and c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; clin@@ ically relevant toxic@@ ity , which were reported in ≥ 1 % and ≤ 5 % ( common ) of patients who received random@@ ized C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin and P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed : &quot;

&quot; serious cardiovascular and cereb@@ rov@@ ascular events , including m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction , ang@@ ina pec@@ tor@@ is , cereb@@ rov@@ ascular is@@ insulin and trans@@ itory isch@@ em@@ ic attacks were reported in clinics with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed , commonly administered in combination with another cy@@ tot@@ ox@@ ic substance . &quot;
&quot; in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment , cases of co@@ li@@ - tis ( including intestinal and rec@@ tal bleeding , sometimes fatal , intestinal transit , intestinal nec@@ ro@@ sis and typ@@ ho@@ litis ) were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment , cases of sometimes fatal inter@@ sti@@ tial pneum@@ oni@@ tis with respiratory in@@ suffici@@ ency were reported in patients with p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed treatment . &quot;
it was reported on cases of acute ren@@ al failure in p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed mon@@ otherapy or in combination with other chemotherapy agents ( see section 4.4 ) .
cases of radiation pneum@@ oni@@ tis were reported in patients who were ir@@ radi@@ ated before or after their P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ xed therapy ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed ) is a ant@@ ine@@ oplas@@ tic anti@@ fol@@ ate , which performs its effect by interrup@@ ting important fol@@ lic@@ le @-@ dependent metabolic processes necessary for cell rep@@ lication . &quot;
&quot; in vitro studies showed that p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed acts as anti@@ fol@@ ate with several points of attack by blocking the thy@@ me dy@@ late syn@@ th@@ ase ( TS ) , D@@ ih@@ y@@ dro@@ fol@@ ate reduc@@ t@@ ase ( D@@ H@@ FR ) and Gly@@ cin@@ am@@ i@@ dri@@ bon@@ u@@ cle@@ ot@@ id@@ for@@ - m@@ yl@@ transfer@@ ase ( G@@ AR@@ FT ) , which are the follow @-@ dependent key enzymes in the de nov@@ o Bi@@ osyn@@ thesis of thy@@ mid@@ ine and pur@@ inn@@ u@@ cle@@ oti@@ des . &quot;
&quot; E@@ MP@@ H@@ AC@@ IS , a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , simple @-@ blind Phase 3 study of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA plus c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin for chem@@ on@@ ai@@ ven patients with malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma showed that patients with AD@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin had a clin@@ ically significant benefit to those patients who were only cau@@ tious with c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
the primary analysis of this study was carried out in the population of all patients receiving the medication in the treatment arm ( random@@ ized and treated ) .
statisti@@ cally significant improvement in the clin@@ ically relevant symptoms ( pain and dy@@ sp@@ nea ) in connection with the malign@@ ant ple@@ ural end@@ othel@@ i@@ oma was shown in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm ( 2@@ 12 patients ) .
the differences between the two arms showed an improvement in lung function parameters in the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA / C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin arm and in@@ timi@@ dation of lung function over time in the control room .
&quot; a multi @-@ centric , random@@ ised , open phase III trial with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA against doc@@ et@@ axel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSC@@ LC showed an medi@@ an survival of 8.3 months in patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA ( Int@@ ent to treat Population n = 28@@ 3 ) and 7.@@ 9 months in patients treated with doc@@ et@@ axel ( IT@@ T n = 28@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; an analysis of the influence of hist@@ ology on overall survival fell in favour of A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA in patients with NSC@@ LC with a predominantly non @-@ plate epitheli@@ al hist@@ ological type ( n = 3@@ 99 , 6.2 versus 7.@@ 4 months , adapted HR = 1.@@ 56 ; 95 % CI = 1.@@ 08 @-@ 2.@@ 26 , p = 0.0@@ 18 ) . &quot;
&quot; limited data of a separately random@@ ised , controlled phase 3 study show that efficacy data ( survival and progression @-@ free survival ) for p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed between patients with ( n = 41 ) and without ( n = 5@@ 40 ) pre@@ treatment similar to doc@@ et@@ axel is similar . &quot;
the efficacy analyses of the P@@ Q population are consistent with the analyses of the IT@@ T population and support the non @-@ superi@@ ority of the A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination against gem@@ cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin combination .
&quot; mean P@@ FS was 4,8 months for the combination of cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin versus 5.1 months for the combination of cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ( adjusted HR = 1.@@ 04 ; 95 % CI = 25.@@ 0 - 3@@ 1,4 ) for the combination of cit@@ ab@@ ine c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin . &quot;
&quot; analysis of the influence of NSC@@ LC &apos;s hist@@ ology on survival showed clin@@ ically relevant differences in hist@@ ology , see table below . &quot;
&quot; CI = confidence interval ; IT@@ T = Sur@@ face @-@ to @-@ treat ; N = Size of the total population a Statisti@@ cal Sig@@ ni@@ fic@@ ant for non @-@ superi@@ ority , with a total confidence interval for HR ( = Haz@@ ard ratio ) significantly below the non @-@ lower limit of 1,@@ 17@@ 6@@ 45 ( p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) . &quot;
&quot; patients treated with A@@ LI@@ M@@ TA and C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin needed less trans@@ fu@@ sions ( 16.@@ 4 % versus 28.@@ 9 % , p &lt; 0.@@ 001 ) , ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te transfer ( 1.8 % versus 4.5 % , p = 0.00@@ 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition , patients needed the gift of ery@@ thro@@ po@@ ie@@ tin / Dar@@ b@@ opo@@ e@@ tin ( 10.@@ 4 % versus 18.@@ 1 % , p &lt; 0,@@ 001 ) , G @-@ CS@@ F / GM @-@ CS@@ F ( 3.1 % versus 7.0 % , p = 0.0@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 26 cancer patients with different solid tumours in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² , pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed in doses ranging from 0.2 to 8@@ 38 mg / m ² were examined in in@@ fusion zones over a period of 10 minutes . &quot;
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed is mainly ex@@ cre@@ ted in the urine and 70 % to 90 % of the dos@@ ed dose will be found in the urine within 24 hours of the application .
P@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed has a total of 9@@ 1.8 ml / min and the half @-@ life in plasma is 3.5 hours in normal ren@@ al fun@@ tion ( Kre@@ at@@ in@@ in @-@ Clear@@ ance 90 ml / min ) .
&quot; in a study with Be@@ ag@@ le dogs , which had received intraven@@ ous bol@@ us inj@@ ections for 9 months , sti@@ cky changes were observed ( degeneration / nec@@ ro@@ sis of the sem@@ ini@@ f@@ al epitheli@@ al tissue ) . &quot;
&quot; unless otherwise applied , the storage times and conditions after preparation are in the responsibility of the user and should normally not exceed 24 hours at 2 to 8 ° C unless the preparation / di@@ lution has occurred under controlled and vali@@ dated as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . &quot;
&quot; dissolve the content of the 100 mg dose bottles with 4.2 ml 0,@@ 9 % sodium chlori@@ de injection solution ( 9 mg / ml ) without preser@@ vatives , resulting in a solution with a concentration of about 25 mg / ml of p@@ em@@ et@@ re@@ mixed . &quot;

&quot; the resulting solution is clear and the colouring is from colour@@ less to yellow or green@@ ish yellow , without compromising the quality of the products . &quot;
&quot; it is used in overweight adults with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) ≥ 28 kg per square meter in conjunction with a low @-@ cal@@ orie , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
patients who take allergy and do not have a weight loss after 12 weeks should contact their doctor or pharmac@@ ist .
&quot; if these enzymes are ham@@ mer@@ ed , they can not break down some fats in the food , causing approximately a quarter of the fats led with food un@@ di@@ gest@@ ed the intest@@ ines . &quot;
&quot; in a third study , All@@ i was compared to 3@@ 91 overweight patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 compared to placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the two studies of patients with a BM@@ I of ≥ 28 kg / m2 , patients who received an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg after a year had an average weight loss of 4.@@ 8 kg compared to 2.3 kg in the use of placebo . &quot;
&quot; in the study with All@@ i in patients with a BM@@ I between 25 and 28 kg / m2 , no weight loss could be observed for patients . &quot;
&quot; the most common side effects of All@@ i ( observed in more than 1 out of 10 patients ) are o@@ ily spots at anus , fl@@ atus ( winds ) with stu@@ cco , stu@@ cco strand , gre@@ asy / o@@ ily chair , leaving o@@ ily secre@@ tion ( rot@@ ting ) , flat@@ ul@@ ence ( winds ) and soft chairs . &quot;
it must not be used in patients who are treated with c@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( to prevent organ rejection in transplan@@ t patients ) or with medicines such as war@@ far@@ in for preventing blood cl@@ ots .
&quot; furthermore , it may not be used in patients suffering from a long @-@ term mal@@ absorption syndrome ( with which insufficient nutrients from the digestive tract ) or chol@@ est@@ ase ( liver disease ) suffer , and in pregnant or nursing mothers . &quot;
&quot; in July 2007 , the European Commission granted Gla@@ xo Group Limited a permit to transport Or@@ list@@ at GS@@ K across the European Union . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i is indicated for the weight reduction of adults with overweight ( Body @-@ Mass Index BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 ) and should be used in conjunction with a slightly hypo@@ kal@@ ative , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; all@@ i may not be used by children and adolescents under 18 , because there are insufficient data on efficacy and safety . &quot;
&quot; however , as or@@ list@@ at is only minim@@ ally resor@@ bed , elderly people and patients with reduced liver and / or kidney function are not required to adjust the dosage . &quot;
• chronic treatment with C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see section 4.6 ) • Pre@@ mature treatment with war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( see Sec@@ tion@@ 4.5 and 4.@@ 8 )
the likel@@ ihood of occurrence of gastro@@ intestinal symptoms ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) may increase if all@@ i is taken along with a fat @-@ rich single meal or fat @-@ rich diet .
&quot; since the weight reduction in diabetes can be accompanied by an improved metabolic control , patients who take a medicine against diabetes should consult a doctor or pharmac@@ ist before starting a therapy with all@@ i because the dose of the anti@@ diabe@@ tic needs to be adjusted if necessary . &quot;
patients who take all@@ i as well as medicines for high blood pressure or elevated cholesterol levels should ask their doctor or pharmac@@ ist whether the dosage of these drugs has to be adjusted .
it is recommended to take additional pregnancy @-@ contrac@@ tive measures in order to prevent the potential failure of oral contrac@@ eption in case of severe diar@@ rho@@ ea ( see section 4.5 ) .
both in a study on drug interactions and in several cases with simultaneous use of or@@ list@@ at and C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in a sin@@ king of the C@@ ic@@ los@@ por@@ in plasma was observed .
&quot; in the application of war@@ far@@ in or other oral anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants in combination with or@@ list@@ at , the Quick values ( international normal ratio , IN@@ R ) could be affected ( see section 4.@@ 8 ) . &quot;
&quot; in most patients treated with or@@ list@@ at in clinical trials up to 4 full years , the levels of vitamins A , D , E and K as well as beta carot@@ ene remained in the normal range . &quot;
&quot; however , patients should be advised to take a supplementary mul@@ tiv@@ it@@ amin supplement before bed@@ time to ensure adequate vitamin intake ( see section 4.4 ) . &quot;
&quot; after the administration of one single dose of A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ one , a marginal number of healthy volunteers who received or@@ list@@ at were observed a minor decrease in the A@@ mi@@ o@@ dar@@ on plasma concentration . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies showed no direct or indirect damaging effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; the side effects of or@@ list@@ at are mainly gastro@@ intestinal nature and are associated with the pharmac@@ ological effect of the drug , as the absorption of bi@@ ased fat is prevented . &quot;
the gastro@@ intestinal side effects were obtained from clinical trials with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg over a period of 18 months to 2 years and were generally mild and temporary .
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) , rare ( ≥ 1 / 10 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , rarely ( ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 1000 ) , not known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot;
&quot; the frequency of reported adverse events reported after the launch of or@@ list@@ at is not known , as these events were voluntarily reported by a population of un@@ certain size . &quot;
† It is plau@@ sible that the treatment with all@@ i can lead to anxiety regarding possible or actual gastro@@ intestinal side effects .
single doses of 800 mg or@@ list@@ at and multiple doses of up to 400 mg three times a day were administered to normal and obes@@ e patients over a period of 15 days without significant clinical findings .
&quot; in the majority of cases reported after market launch , either side effects or similar side effects were reported as at the recommended dose of or@@ list@@ at . &quot;
&quot; based on research on humans and animals , a rapid recovery of possible systemic effects that can be traced back to the properties of or@@ list@@ at can be assumed . &quot;
the therapeutic effect lies in the l@@ umen of the stomach and the upper small intest@@ ine through co@@ valent bonding to the active Ser@@ in residue of ga@@ stri@@ c and pancre@@ atic li@@ pas@@ es .
&quot; clinical trials have been derived that 60 mg or@@ list@@ at , taken three times a day , has blocked the absorption of approximately 25 % of the food fat . &quot;
&quot; two double blind , random@@ ised , placebo @-@ controlled studies in adults with a BM@@ I ≥ 28 kg / m2 demonstrate the efficacy of 60 mg or@@ list@@ at that has been taken three times a day in combination with a hypo@@ kal@@ ine , fat @-@ reduced diet . &quot;
&quot; the primary parameter , the change in weight compared to the initial value ( at the time of random@@ isation ) , was evaluated as follows : as a change in the body weight in the course of study ( Table 1 ) and as a percentage of those participating in study , which have lost more than 5 % or more than 10 % of their initial weight ( Table 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; although weight reduction was observed over 12 months in both studies , the greatest weight loss occurred in the first 6 months . &quot;
the average dietary change in the Gesamt@@ chol@@ esterin was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg -@@ 2.4 % ( initial value 5.@@ 20 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and with placebo + 2.8 % ( initial value 5.@@ 26 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
the average change in LD@@ L cholesterol was with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg - 3.5 % ( initial value 3.@@ 30 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) and placebo + 3.@@ 8 % ( initial value : 3.@@ 41 m@@ mo@@ l / l ) .
&quot; at waist circum@@ ference , the average change was -@@ 4.5 cm with or@@ list@@ at 60 mg ( starting point 10@@ 3.@@ 7 cm ) and with placebo -@@ 3,@@ 6 cm ( bas@@ eline 10@@ 3.5 cm ) . &quot;
plasma concentrations of non @-@ met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at were not measurable 8 hours after the oral administration of 360 mg or@@ list@@ at ( &lt; 5 n@@ g / ml ) .
&quot; 7 In general , not met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed or@@ list@@ at in plasma could be detected spor@@ adi@@ cally and at extremely low concentrations ( &lt; 10 n@@ g / ml or 0,@@ 02 µ@@ mo@@ l ) and without signs of cum@@ ulation . &quot;
&quot; two main metabol@@ ites , namely M1 ( in position 4 hydro@@ ly@@ zed lac@@ t@@ onal ring ) and M3 ( M1 after separation of the N @-@ For@@ my@@ l leu@@ c@@ ine group ) , were identified , representing approximately 42 % of the total plasma concentrations . &quot;
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated use , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity , carcin@@ ogen@@ ic potential and reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data cannot detect any particular danger to humans . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ o@@ vi@@ gil@@ ance system The holder of approval for the marketing authorization must ensure that the pharmac@@ o@@ virus system , as described in module 1.@@ 8.@@ 1. of the authorisation application , is applied and works before and while the product is available on the market . &quot;
risk management planning The holder of approval for the transport company comm@@ its itself to conduct the trials and additional pharmac@@ o@@ virus activities as described in the pharmac@@ ovi@@ gil@@ ance plan and thus comply with the agreement of the risk management plan ( R@@ MP ) of October 2008 as well as all other updates of the R@@ MPs which are agreed with the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products ( CH@@ MP ) .

&quot; the most common side effects are related to the effect of the capsules , resulting in increasing fat from the body . &quot;
&quot; these side effects usually occur within the first weeks of treatment , as at this time you may have not consistently reduced the fat portion in your diet . &quot;
&quot; with the following basic rules , you can learn to minimize nutritional supplements : • Beg@@ in a few days , or better a week , before the first intake of capsules with a fat diet . • Learn more about the usual fat content of your favorite foods and about the size of portions that you normally take . &quot;
&quot; if you know exactly how much you eat , the likel@@ ihood that you exceed your fat limit decreases . • Share your recommended fat amount evenly to daily meals . &quot;
&quot; save the amount of calories and fat that you are allowed to take per meal , not to take them in the form of a fat @-@ rich main court or a substantial Nach@@ tisch@@ sch@@ ism as you possibly have done in other programs for weight reduction . &quot;
&quot; • Do not store medicines for children . • Do not store any more than 25 ° C after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified on the box . • The container tightly closed to protect the contents from moisture . • The bottle contains two white sealed containers with si@@ lic@@ a@@ gel , which serve to keep the capsules dry . &quot;
do not swallow them in any case . • You can take your daily dose all@@ i in the blue transport box ( shuttle ) which is enclosed with this package .

obesity has an impact on your health and increases the risk of developing various serious diseases such as : • high blood pressure • Diabetes • Heart disease • stroke • Cer@@ tain cancers • O@@ ste@@ o@@ arthritis Spe@@ aking with your doctor about your risk for these diseases .
&quot; permanent weight loss , for example by improving nutrition and more exercise , can prevent severe diseases and has a positive effect on your health . &quot;
&quot; choose meals that contain a wide range of nutrients , and gradually learn to eat permanently healthy . &quot;
&quot; energy is also measured in kil@@ o@@ j@@ ou@@ les , which can also be found on food packaging . • The recommended cal@@ orie intake indicates how many calories you should consume at maximum per day . &quot;
keep in mind the tables below . • The recommended fat intake in grams is the maximum amount of fat that you should take with each meal .
&quot; the amount of calories that is suitable for you can be found in the information below , which indicates the number of calories that is appropriate for you . • Due to the capsule &apos;s mode of action , adher@@ ence to recommended fat intake is crucial . &quot;
&quot; if you take the same amount of fat as before , this can mean that your body cannot handle this amount of fat . &quot;
&quot; by compl@@ ying with the recommended fat intake , you can maximize weight loss and at the same time decrease the likel@@ ihood of nutritional supplements . • You should try to take gradual and continuous weight . &quot;
&quot; 34 This cal@@ orie intake should allow you to gradually and continuously lose approximately 0.5 kg per week , without developing frustr@@ ations and dis@@ appointments . &quot;
&quot; the more active you are , the higher your recommended cal@@ orie intake . • &quot; &quot; Medium physical activity &quot; &quot; means that you can burn 150 k@@ cal every day , e.g. by 3 km walking , 30@@ - to 45 @-@ minute gardening or 2 km running in 15 minutes . &quot;
&quot; • For permanent weight loss , it is necessary to set oneself realistic cal@@ orie and fat targets and also adhere to it . • Me@@ et is a nutritional journal with information on cal@@ orie and fat content of your meals . • T@@ ry to move more before you start taking all@@ i . &quot;
the all@@ i program to support weight loss combines the capsules with a nutritional plan and a large number of other information materials that can help you to eat cal@@ orie and gre@@ asy foods and give guidelines to become physically active .
&quot; combined with a program tailored to your type to support weight loss , this information can help you develop a healthier lifestyle and achieve your target weight . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi is used in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( like c@@ is@@ pl@@ atin ) , as well as in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , which are moderate triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting ( such as cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in or carb@@ op@@ l@@ atin ) . &quot;
the efficacy of Alo@@ xi can be increased by the additional administration of a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids ( a medicine used as an anti@@ em@@ etic drug ) .
the use of patients under 18 years of age is not recommended as there is not enough information on the effects of this age group .
&quot; this means that the substance inhi@@ bits the binding of a chemical substance in the body , 5 @-@ hydro@@ xy@@ tr@@ yp@@ t@@ amin ( 5@@ HT , also known as ser@@ oton@@ in ) , to the recept@@ ors in the gut . &quot;
&quot; Alo@@ xi was studied in three main studies on 1,@@ 8@@ 42 adults who received chemotherapy , which are strong or moderate rele@@ as@@ ers for nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the strong triggers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 59 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting in 24 hours after chemotherapy ( 132 of 2@@ 23 ) , compared to 57 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 126 of 2@@ 21 ) . &quot;
&quot; in chem@@ otherap@@ ies , the moderate rele@@ as@@ ers for nausea and vom@@ iting , 81 % of patients treated with Alo@@ xi showed no vom@@ iting ( 153 of 18@@ 9 ) compared to 69 % of patients treated with On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron ( 127 of 185 ) . &quot;
in a comparison with Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron these values were 63 % for Alo@@ xi ( 119 of 18@@ 9 patients ) and 53 % for Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron ( 101 of 191 patients ) .
&quot; in March 2005 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Helsinki Bi@@ re@@ x Pharmaceuticals Ltd . a permit for the use of Alo@@ xi in the entire European Union . &quot;
Alo@@ xi is inde@@ xed : to prevent acute nausea and vom@@ iting in heavily em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer and for prevention of nausea and vom@@ iting in moder@@ ately em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy due to cancer .
&quot; the efficacy of Alo@@ xi to prevent nausea and vom@@ iting , which is induced by a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy , can be ampli@@ fied by adding a cor@@ ti@@ co@@ ster@@ oids given before chemotherapy . &quot;
&quot; since Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can pro@@ long the colon , patients with an@@ am@@ n@@ esti@@ scher ob@@ sti@@ pation or signs of a sub@@ acute i@@ le@@ us should be closely monitored after injection . &quot;
&quot; however , as with other 5@@ HT@@ 3 antagon@@ ists , caution is advised at the simultaneous administration of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron with medicines that extend the Q@@ T interval or in patients with which the Q@@ T interval is prolonged or which tend to such extension . &quot;
&quot; in addition to chemotherapy , in the days following chemotherapy , Alo@@ xi is not intended to be used for the prevention or treatment of nausea and vom@@ iting . &quot;
&quot; in prec@@ lin@@ ical studies Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron did not obstruc@@ t the activity of the five studied chem@@ otherap@@ ics ( C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide , Cy@@ clo@@ ab@@ in , Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and Mit@@ om@@ y@@ cin C ) . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical trial , no significant pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic interaction between a single intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron and a Ste@@ ady stat@@ e- concentration of oral met@@ oc@@ clu@@ ster@@ oids , a C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ or was found . &quot;
&quot; a pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic analysis based on a population showed that the simultaneous administration of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 induc@@ tors ( dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one and ri@@ f@@ amp@@ ic@@ in ) as well as C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 inhibit@@ ors ( am@@ i@@ o@@ dar@@ on , c@@ elec@@ oxi@@ b , chlor@@ pro@@ ma@@ z@@ ine , rit@@ on@@ avi@@ r , ser@@ tr@@ aline and ter@@ bin@@ af@@ in ) had no significant effect on the clearance of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; the use of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in human pregn@@ ancies does not occur , so Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron should not be used in pregnant women unless it is considered necessary by the attending physician . &quot;
&quot; clinical trials were the most frequent in a dose of 250 mc@@ g. of observed side effects ( a total of 6@@ 33 patients ) , which at least possibly were associated with Alo@@ xi , head@@ aches ( 9 % ) and ob@@ sti@@ pation ( 5 % ) . &quot;
&quot; very rare cases ( &lt; 1 / 10,000 ) of hyper@@ sensitivity reactions and reactions at the destination ( burning , har@@ dening , discomfort and pain ) were reported in post @-@ marketing experience reports . &quot;
the group with the highest dosage had similar frequency of adverse events as in the other dosage groups ; there were no dose @-@ active relationships observed .
&quot; no di@@ aly@@ sis studies have been carried out , however , due to the large distribution volume , a di@@ aly@@ sis is probably not an effective therapy for Alo@@ xi@@ - over@@ dose . &quot;
&quot; in two random@@ ised double blind studies , a total of 1,@@ 132 patients who received a moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≤ 50 mg / m2 of C@@ is@@ pl@@ atin , Car@@ b@@ op@@ l@@ atin , ≤ 1,500 mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250@@ mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250@@ mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250@@ mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250@@ mg / m2 Do@@ x@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in and 250@@ mg / m2 were given intraven@@ ously on Day 1 without dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one . &quot;
&quot; in a random@@ ized double @-@ blind study , a total of 6@@ 67 patients who received a strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy with ≥ 60 mg / m2 cyclo@@ phosph@@ amide and d@@ ac@@ ar@@ ba@@ z@@ ine as well as 250 or 750 micro@@ grams of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were compared with patients given intraven@@ ously 32 mg On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron . &quot;
results of studies with moderate @-@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy and the study of strongly em@@ eto@@ genic chemotherapy are summ@@ arized in the following tables .
&quot; in clinical trials of the indication of chemotherapy @-@ induced nausea and vom@@ iting ( C@@ IN@@ V ) , the effects of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron were comparable to blood pressure , heart rate and EC@@ G parameters including the Q@@ t@@ c interval with the corresponding effects of On@@ dan@@ set@@ ron and Dol@@ as@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; following clinical investigations , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron has the ability to block the ion channels involved in v@@ entri@@ cular degeneration and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of the action potential . &quot;
&quot; the purpose of the study carried out in 2@@ 21 healthy subjects was the evaluation of the EC@@ G @-@ effects of i.@@ v. administered Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron in single doses of 0.@@ 25 , 0.@@ 75 and 2.@@ 25 mg . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption After intraven@@ ous administration , an initial decrease in plasma concentrations follows a slow elimination from the body with an average time @-@ term half @-@ life of approximately 40 hours . &quot;
the average maximum plasma concentration ( C@@ MA@@ x ) and the area under the concentration time curve ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) are generally dose @-@ proportional in the entire dose range of 0.@@ - 90 μ g / kg in healthy patients and cancer patients .
&quot; after an intraven@@ ous dose of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron 0.@@ 25 mg every second day for a total of 3 doses , the mean ( ± SD ) cell concentration measured in 11 testi@@ cular cancer patients was 42 ± 34 % between day 1 and day 5 . &quot;
&quot; pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic simulations show that at once daily intraven@@ ous dose of 0.@@ 25 mg Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron was comparable to 3 consecutive days of measured value ( AU@@ C@@ 0@@ - ∞ ) , which was measured after a one @-@ time intraven@@ ous administration of 0.@@ 75 mg . however , the C@@ MA@@ x was higher after one @-@ time dose of 0.@@ 75 mg . &quot;
about 40 % are eliminated by the kidneys and about 50 % are converted into two primary metabol@@ ites which compared to Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron have less than 1 % of the antagon@@ istic effect on the 5@@ HT@@ 3 receptor .
&quot; in vitro studies on metabolism , C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 and , in lesser degree , the I@@ so@@ dic C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 1@@ A2 are involved in the metabolism of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron . &quot;
&quot; elimination After an intraven@@ ous single dose of 10 micro@@ grams / kg &#91; 14@@ C &#93; -@@ Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , about 80 % of the dose was found within 144 hours in the urine , Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron as un@@ modified active ingredient made about 40 % of the given dose . &quot;
&quot; after a unique intraven@@ ous injection , the total body was 17@@ 3 ± 73 ml / min and the ren@@ al clearance 53 ± 29 ml / min . &quot;
&quot; although patients with severe liver function disorder have increased the terminal elimination time and the average systemic exposure with Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron , however , a reduction in the dose is not justified . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ clinical studies , effects were only observed after exposure , which should be considered sufficient above the maximum human therapeutic exposure , suggest@@ ing a low relevance for clinical use . &quot;
10 Out of prec@@ lin@@ ical studies evidence that Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron can only block ion channels in very high concentrations that are involved in v@@ entri@@ cular de@@ - and rep@@ ol@@ arization and extend the duration of action .
&quot; high doses of Pal@@ on@@ os@@ et@@ ron ( each dose correspon@@ ded to approximately the 30@@ x of the therapeutic exposure in humans ) , which were given daily over two years , led to an increased frequency of liver tumours , endo@@ cr@@ ine ne@@ oplas@@ ms ( in thy@@ roid gland , p@@ itu@@ itary gland , pancre@@ as , adren@@ al mar@@ row ) and skin tumours in rats , however , not in mice . &quot;
&quot; the underlying mechanisms are not fully known , but due to the high dos@@ ages used and since Alo@@ xi is determined by humans for one @-@ time application , the relevance of these results is low for humans . &quot;
the holder of this permit for the transport of goods must inform the European Commission on the plans for the marketing of the medicine approved as part of this decision .

&quot; in June 2006 , the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) approved a negative opinion in which the approval of the marketing authorisation for the treatment of hepatitis C was recommended by Al@@ ph@@ eon 6 million IE / ml injection solution . &quot;
&quot; this means that al@@ ph@@ eon should resemble a biological drug called Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A with the same drug , which is already approved in the EU ( also called &quot; &quot; reference drug &quot; &quot; ) . &quot;
al@@ ph@@ eon should be used to treat adult patients with chronic ( persistent ) hepatitis C ( a liver disease caused by virus infection ) .
&quot; in a micro@@ scopic examination , liver tissue damage causes damage , and the values of the liver enzyme al@@ anine amino ran@@ s@@ fer@@ ase ( AL@@ T ) are further increased in the blood . &quot;
&quot; it is produced by a yeast in which a gene ( DNA ) was introduced , which stimulates the formation of the active substance . &quot;
&quot; the manufacturer of Al@@ ph@@ eon presented data that demonstrate the comparison of al@@ ph@@ eon with Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A ( substance structure , composition and purity of the drug , mode of operation , safety and efficacy in hepatitis C ) . &quot;
&quot; in the study of hepatitis C patients , the efficacy of al@@ ph@@ eon was compared to the efficacy of the reference doctor in 4@@ 55 patients . &quot;
the study was measured how many patients responded to the drug after 12 of a total of 48 treatment weeks and 6 months after the treatment was received ( i.e. no signs of the virus in the blood ) .
( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 00 Fax ( 44 @-@ 20 ) 74 18 84 16 E @-@ mail : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ eme@@ a.@@ eu@@ .@@ int © E@@ MEA 2006 Re@@ production and / or distribution of this document is acknowledged
&quot; in addition , concerns were expressed over the fact that the data on the stability of the drug and the drug to be marketed was not sufficient . &quot;
the number of hepatitis C patients who responded to treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon and Ro@@ fer@@ on @-@ A was similar in clinical study .
&quot; after the treatment with al@@ ph@@ eon , the disease was again reduced to more patients than with the reference drug ; moreover , al@@ ph@@ eon had more side effects . &quot;
&quot; apart from this , the test used in the study to investigate the extent to which the medicine is immune response ( i.e. the body forms antibodies - special proteins - against the medicine ) is not sufficiently vali@@ dated . &quot;
&quot; it can be used to treat Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o ( a skin infection associated with crust formation ) and small infected in@@ firm@@ ations ( crack or cutting ) , abra@@ sions and stit@@ ching wounds . &quot;
Al@@ tar@@ go should not be used to treat infections that have been proven or presumably caused by meth@@ ic@@ il@@ lin@@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) because Alar@@ go may not affect this kind of infections .
&quot; al@@ tar@@ go can be applied in patients with nine months of age , but in patients under 18 years the area to be treated may not be more than 2 % of the body &apos;s surface . &quot;
&quot; if the patient does not respond to the treatment after two or three days , the doctor should examine the patient again and consider alternative treatments . &quot;
it works by blocking the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ omes ( the parts of the bacterial cells in which proteins are produced ) and thereby inhi@@ bits the growth of bacteria .
the main indicator of efficacy was in all five trials of the proportion of patients whose infection was cleared after the end of the treatment .
119 ( 8@@ 5.@@ 6 % ) of the 139 patients under Al@@ tar@@ go and 37 ( 5@@ 2.1 % ) of 71 patients under placebo addressed the treatment .
&quot; in the treatment of infected skin wounds , Al@@ tar@@ go and C@@ ef@@ al@@ ex@@ in showed similar response rates : when the results of both studies were examined together with skin wounds , about 90 % of both groups responded to the treatment . &quot;
&quot; however , in these two studies , Al@@ tar@@ go was not effective enough in the treatment of ab@@ sc@@ esses ( freezing cavi@@ ties in the body tissues ) or infections caused by MR@@ SA . &quot;
the most common side effect with al@@ tar@@ go ( which was observed in 1 to 10 of 100 patients ) is a irrit@@ ation at the job site .
&quot; the Committee for Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that the benefits of Al@@ tar@@ go were out@@ weighed in the short @-@ term treatment of the following superficial skin infections : • Im@@ pe@@ tig@@ o , • infected small in@@ firm@@ aries , abra@@ sions or stit@@ ched wounds . &quot;
&quot; in May 2007 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company Gla@@ xo Group Ltd . a permit for the transport of Al@@ tar@@ go across the European Union . &quot;
patients with no improvement within two or three days should be examined again and an alternative therapy should be considered ( see section 4.4 ) .
&quot; in the case of sensi@@ tization or serious local irrit@@ ation by the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve , the treatment should be abor@@ ted , the o@@ int@@ ment is carefully di@@ gest@@ ed and an appropriate alternative treatment of the infection is started . &quot;
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin should not be used to treat infections in which MR@@ SA is known or suspected as patho@@ gen ( see section 5.1 ) .
&quot; in clinical trials of secondary open wounds , the efficacy of retin@@ am@@ ulin was insufficient in patients with infections caused by a meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in @-@ resistant Stap@@ hy@@ lo@@ co@@ cc@@ us au@@ re@@ us ( MR@@ SA ) . &quot;
an alternative therapy should be considered if after a 2 @-@ 3 @-@ day treatment no improvement or deterioration of the infected area occurs .
the effect of the simultaneous use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin and other topical remedies on the same skin surface is not examined and the simultaneous use of other topical pharmaceuticals is not recommended .
a clin@@ ically relevant in@@ hibition in vi@@ vo is not expected ( see Section 5.2 ) due to the low plasma concentrations that have been reached in humans after topical application on isolated skin or infected superficial wounds .
&quot; 3 After the simultaneous oral administration of 2 times daily 200 mg of k@@ eto@@ con@@ az@@ ol , the mean Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) and C@@ MA@@ x were increased by 81 % after topical application of 1 % retin@@ ot@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin . &quot;
&quot; due to the low systemic exposure to topical application in patients , dose adap@@ tations are not considered necessary when topical re@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is applied during systemic treatment with C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 inhibit@@ ors . &quot;
animal studies have shown a reproductive toxic@@ ity after oral consumption and are inadequate in relation to a statement on the birth and fet@@ al / post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) .
Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ be should only be used during pregnancy if a topical anti@@ bacterial therapy is clearly indicated and the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is prefer@@ able to the administration of a systemic antibiotic .
deciding whether breast@@ feeding continues / terminated or the treatment with Al@@ tar@@ go should be continued / terminated is to weigh between the benefit of breast@@ feeding for the infant and the benefit of the Al@@ tar@@ go therapy for the woman .
&quot; in clinical trials involving 2@@ 150 patients with superficial skin infections , the Al@@ tar@@ go was the most widely reported adverse event irrit@@ ation at the administration of the administration , which affects approximately 1 % of patients . &quot;
&quot; Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is a semi @-@ synthetic deri@@ v@@ ative of P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ lin , a substance that is isolated by fermentation from Cl@@ it@@ op@@ il@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ( formerly Ple@@ ur@@ ot@@ us pass@@ eck@@ eri@@ anus ) . &quot;
the active mechanism of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin is based on selective in@@ hibition of bacterial protein synthesis through interaction at a specific binding site of the 50s support unit of the bacterial ri@@ bos@@ ome that differs from the binding sites of other ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al inter@@ acting anti@@ bacterial substances .
data indicate that the binding site ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al protein L@@ 3 is involved and lies in the region of the ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al P @-@ binding site and the Pep@@ ti@@ dy@@ l@@ transfer@@ ase centre .
&quot; by binding on this binding site , P@@ leu@@ ro@@ mu@@ ti@@ line hem@@ med the pep@@ tide transfer , block partial P @-@ binding interactions and prevent the normal formation of active 50 ri@@ bos@@ om@@ al sub@@ units . &quot;
&quot; should the local pre@@ valence of resistance appear to be the use of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin at at least some infection forms , a consultation should be as@@ pi@@ red by experts . &quot;
no differences in the in @-@ vitro activity of Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin was observed in relation to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us irrespective of whether the isol@@ ates were sensitive or resistant to meth@@ ic@@ ill@@ in .
&quot; in case of failure to respond to S.@@ au@@ re@@ us treatment , the presence of trun@@ ks with additional vir@@ ul@@ ence factors ( such as PV@@ L = P@@ anton @-@ Valent@@ ine Leu@@ co@@ ci@@ din ) should be considered . &quot;
&quot; resor@@ ption In a healthy adult study , 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin sage was applied daily in oc@@ clu@@ sion to intact and lac@@ ed skin for up to 7 days . &quot;
&quot; of 5@@ 16 patients ( adults and children ) who received 1 % Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin Sal@@ ve twice daily for 5 days for topical treatment of secondary trau@@ matic wounds , individual plasma samples were obtained . &quot;
samples were taken during the days 3 or 4 in the adult patients before the medication and the children between 0 @-@ 12 hours after the last application .
&quot; however , the maximum individual systemic acceptance on humans according to topical application of 1 % sal@@ be on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ewed skin ( C@@ MA@@ x = 22 n@@ g / ml ; AU@@ C ( 0 @-@ 24 ) = 2@@ 38 n@@ g · h / ml ) 6@@ 60 times lower than the Ret@@ ap@@ am@@ ulin IC@@ 50 for P@@ GP inhibit@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; metabolism The in vitro oxid@@ ative metabolism of retin@@ ot@@ o@@ glob@@ ulin in human liver micro@@ som@@ s was primarily medi@@ ated by C@@ Y@@ P@@ 3@@ A4 , lower involvement of C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ C@@ 8 and C@@ Y@@ P@@ 2@@ D@@ 6 ( see section 4.5 ) . &quot;
&quot; in studies on the oral toxic@@ ity of rats ( 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg ) performed over 14 days , there were signs of adaptive liver and thy@@ roid disease . &quot;
in @-@ vitro analysis on gene mut@@ ation and / or chromos@@ om@@ al effects in the mouse lymp@@ ho@@ oma test or in cultures of human peripheral blood lymp@@ ho@@ cytes as well as in the rats micro@@ kernel test for in @-@ vi@@ vo investigation of chromos@@ om@@ al effects .
&quot; there was neither male nor female rats evidence of reduced fertility in oral dos@@ ages of 50 , 150 or 450 mg / kg / day , whereby a up to 5 times higher exposure was achieved than the highest estimated exposure to humans ( topical application on 200 c@@ m2 of sk@@ ewed skin ) : &quot;
&quot; in an embry@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity study on rats at oral dos@@ ages of ≥ 150 mg / kg / day ( according to the ≥ 3 times the estimated human exposure ( see above ) ) , development sto@@ ic@@ ity ( decreased body weight of fet@@ us and delayed Os@@ si@@ fication ) and mat@@ ernal toxic@@ ity . &quot;

&quot; if the o@@ int@@ ment comes from acci@@ dentally on one of these areas , wash the place with water and ask your doctor for advice if discomfort occurs . &quot;
&quot; after applying the o@@ int@@ ment , you can cover the affected area with a sterile association or a gaz@@ ebo , unless your doctor has advised you not to cover the area . &quot;
&quot; it is offered in an aluminum tube with a plastic zip@@ lock containing 5 , 10 or 15 grams of o@@ int@@ ment , or in an aluminum bag containing 0.5 g of o@@ int@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ ani is used for the protection against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( diseases affecting the liver ) in children aged between one and 15 years , which are not immune to these two diseases . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ ani is used as part of a vacc@@ ination plan consisting of two doses , whereby the protection against hepatitis B may only be achieved after the second dose is administered . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , Ambi@@ rix may only be used if there is a low risk of hepatitis B infection during the imm@@ uni@@ zation and it is ensured that the vaccine existing from two doses can be terminated . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her dose for hepatitis A or B is desired , Ambi@@ rix or any other hepatitis B or B vaccine can be given . &quot;
&quot; vacc@@ ines act by contributing to the immune system ( the natural def@@ ences of the body ) , as it can fight against a disease . &quot;
&quot; after a child has received the vaccine , the immune system detects viruses and surface anti@@ gens as &quot; &quot; alien &quot; &quot; and creates antibodies against it . &quot;
Ambi@@ ani contains the same components as the vacc@@ ination used since 1996 with Twin@@ rix adults and the vacc@@ ination used since 1997 Twin@@ rix children .
&quot; the three vacc@@ ines are used to protect against the same diseases , but Twin@@ rix adults and Twin@@ rix children are given as part of a three @-@ dos@@ ed vacc@@ ination plan . &quot;
&quot; because Ambi@@ rix and Twin@@ rix contain adults identical ingredients , some of the data that support the use of Twin@@ et adults have also been used as evidence for the application of Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
the main indicator of efficacy was the share of vacc@@ inated children who had developed a protective antibody concentration one month after the last injection .
&quot; in an additional study with 20@@ 8 children , the efficacy of the vaccine was compared with a six month and a 12 month interval between the two inj@@ ections . &quot;
Ambi@@ ani conducted between 98 and 100 % of vacc@@ inated children a month after the last injection for the development of protective antibody concentrations against hepatitis A and B .
the additional study showed that the degree of Ambi@@ rix &apos;s degree of protection was similar to a six @-@ month and a 12 @-@ month interval between inj@@ ections .
&quot; the most common side effects of Ambi@@ rix ( observed with more than 1 of 10 vaccine doses ) are headache , loss of appetite , pain at the injection point , redness , mat@@ ur@@ ability ( fatigue ) as well as irrit@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ ence may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to the active ingredients , one of the other components or ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) . &quot;
&quot; in August 2002 , the European Commission issued Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals from the company Gla@@ x@@ o@@ S@@ mith@@ K@@ line Bi@@ ologi@@ cals . &quot;
&quot; the standard vacc@@ ination plan for the pri@@ mor@@ dial imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ ani consists of two doses , whereby the first dose is administered at the date of choice and the second dose is between six and twelve months after the first dose . &quot;
&quot; if a refres@@ her vacc@@ ination is desired for both hepatitis A and hepatitis B , the appropriate mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines or combination vaccine can be vacc@@ inated . &quot;
the anti @-@ hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus ( anti @-@ HB@@ s@@ A@@ g ) and anti @-@ hepatitis A virus are in the same order as after vacc@@ ination with the respective mon@@ ov@@ al@@ ent vacc@@ ines .
&quot; it is not yet fully secured whether immun@@ o@@ competent persons , who have responded to hepatitis A vacc@@ ination , need a refres@@ ment as protection , as they may be protected by immun@@ ological memory even in the case of non @-@ det@@ ectable antibodies . &quot;
&quot; 3 As for all injection @-@ vacc@@ ines , appropriate possibilities of medical treatment and monitoring should always be available immediately for the rare case of an an@@ ap@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ tic reaction after the vacc@@ ination of the vaccine . &quot;
&quot; if a rapid protection against hepatitis B is required , the standardis@@ ation scheme is recommended with the combination vaccine that contains 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; in the case of hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis patients and persons with mal@@ functions of the immune system , there may be no adequate anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibody value after the initial imm@@ uni@@ zation , so that in these cases the gift of additional doses may be required . &quot;
&quot; as an intra@@ ocular injection or intra@@ muscular administration in the glut@@ eal muscle could lead to a sub@@ optimal success , these injection ways should be avoided . &quot;
&quot; in thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia or coag@@ ulation disorders , Ambi@@ rix may , however , be inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ ane@@ ously , as in these cases intra@@ muscular administration may lead to bleeding . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ rix was administered in the second year of life in the form of a separate injection with a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ ite , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - und Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b @-@ vaccine ( DT@@ PA @-@ IP@@ V / HI@@ B ) or combined with a combined meas@@ ur@@ - m@@ um@@ ps vaccine , the immune response was sufficient ( see section 5.1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with immun@@ os@@ upp@@ res@@ sive therapy or in patients with immune defects , it is necessary that no adequate immune response may be achieved . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of this formulation in adults , the frequency of pain , redness , swelling , mat@@ ing , gastro@@ ent@@ eri@@ tis , headache , and fever is comparable to the frequency observed in the earlier thi@@ omer sal@@ - and preser@@ v@@ ative @-@ containing vaccine formulation . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials , 20@@ 29 vacc@@ inations were administered to a total of 10@@ 27 vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years . &quot;
&quot; in a study involving 300 participants at the age of 12 to 15 years , the toler@@ ability of Ambi@@ ani was compared with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; the only exceptions were the higher frequency of pain and mat@@ ur@@ ability on a calculation basis per injection dose Ambi@@ rix , but not on a calculation basis per person . &quot;
pain was observed after the grant of Ambi@@ ani at 50@@ ,@@ 7 % of the subjects compared to 3@@ 9.@@ 1 % in subjects after the dose of a dose of 3 @-@ doses combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; after the complete vacc@@ ination cycle , 6@@ 6.@@ 4 % of subjects received the Ambi@@ rix had pain , compared to 6@@ 3.@@ 8 % in subjects who had been vacc@@ inated with the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine . &quot;
&quot; however , the frequency of mat@@ ur@@ ation was comparable to per pro@@ band ( i.e. over the whole vacc@@ ination cycle at 3@@ 9.@@ 6 % of subjects receiving Ambi@@ rix compared to 3@@ 6.2 % in the subjects receiving the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine ) . &quot;
the frequency of pronounced pain and mat@@ ur@@ ability was low and comparable to those observed after the combination vaccine was taken with the 3 @-@ doses @-@ vacc@@ ination scheme .
&quot; in a comparative study of 1- and 11 @-@ year @-@ old vacc@@ ines , the presence of local reactions and general reactions in the Ambi@@ ri@@ x@@ group was comparable to that observed in the administration of the 3 @-@ dose combination vaccine with 360 immun@@ o@@ hist@@ ochem@@ ically in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
&quot; however , in the 6@@ - to 11@@ - year @-@ olds one reported a frequent occurrence of pain ( at the injection point ) per dose , not per pro@@ band , after vacc@@ ination . &quot;
&quot; the proportion of vacc@@ ines reported by severe side effects during the 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination schem@@ as with Ambi@@ ani or during the 3 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination schem@@ as with the combination vaccine with 360 EL@@ IS@@ A@@ - units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen was not statisti@@ cally different . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials conducted in vacc@@ ines at the age of 1 to 15 years , the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ gence rates for anti @-@ HA@@ V 9@@ 9.@@ 1 % were one month after the first dose and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Ser@@ o@@ conver@@ gence rates for anti @-@ HB@@ s were 7@@ 4.2 % one month after the first dose , and 100 % one month after the second dose ( i.e. in month 7 ) . &quot;
&quot; 7 In a comparative study conducted at 12@@ - to including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , 142 two doses of Ambi@@ rix and 147 received the standard combination vaccine with three doses . &quot;
&quot; in the 28@@ 9 persons whose immun@@ ogen@@ ic@@ ity was sel@@ ectable , the Ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection rates ( SP in the table below ) were significantly higher against hepatitis B in month 2 and 6 according to the administration of the 3 @-@ dose vaccine significantly higher than with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; immun@@ o@@ defici@@ encies , which were achieved in a clinical comparative study of 1- to 11 @-@ year @-@ olds one month after completion of the full vacc@@ ination series ( i.e. in month 7 ) , are listed in the following table . &quot;
&quot; in both studies , the vacc@@ inations received either a 2 @-@ dose vacc@@ ination scheme with Ambi@@ rix or a 3 @-@ dos@@ ed vaccine with a combination vaccine with 360 HA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10@@ µ@@ g re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen . &quot;
the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies could be detected at least 24 months after imm@@ uni@@ zation with Ambi@@ rix in the 0 @-@ 6 @-@ month vacc@@ ination .
&quot; the immune response observed in this study was comparable to that observed after vacc@@ ination of 3 doses with a combination vaccine , consisting of 360 ELISA units of form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated H@@ ep@@ ati@@ tis@@ - A virus and 10 µ@@ g of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen in a dose volume of 0.5 ml . &quot;
&quot; in a clinical study at 12@@ - and including 15 @-@ year @-@ olds , the persist@@ ence of anti @-@ H@@ AV@@ - and anti @-@ HB@@ s antibodies can be compared 24 months after immun@@ isation in the 0 @-@ 6@@ - month vacc@@ ination scheme compared to the 0 @-@ 12 @-@ month vacc@@ ination schedule . &quot;
&quot; if the first dose of Ambi@@ rix in the second year of life was administered simultaneously with the wi@@ dening of a combined di@@ ph@@ th@@ eri@@ - , tet@@ anus , az@@ ell@@ ular per@@ t@@ uss@@ ite , in@@ activated poli@@ om@@ y@@ eli@@ tis@@ - und 8 Ha@@ em@@ ophil@@ us influ@@ enz@@ ae type b vaccine , the immune response was sufficient to all anti@@ gens . &quot;
a clinical study conducted with 3 doses of the current formulation in adults showed similar ser@@ op@@ rot@@ ection and ser@@ o@@ conver@@ gence rates similar to previous formulation for the present formulation .
the vaccine is to be examined both before and after the res@@ us@@ pen@@ dium to investigate possible foreign particles and / or physically visible changes .
&quot; in accordance with Article 114 of Directive 2001 / 83 / EC , state batch release is carried out by a state laboratory or a laboratory authorized for this purpose . &quot;

&quot; the hepatitis A virus is usually transmitted by viral foods and beverages , but can also be transmitted through other ways , such as swimming in eff@@ lu@@ ent waters . &quot;
&quot; you can feel very tired , have a dark urine , pale face , yellow skin and / or eyes ( ja@@ un@@ dice ) and other symptoms that may make a stationary treatment necessary . &quot;
&quot; as with all vacc@@ ines , Ambi@@ rix cannot completely protect against infection with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus , even if the full ino@@ cul@@ ation series has been completed with 2 doses . &quot;
if you / your child is already infected with Hepatitis A@@ - or Hepatitis B virus before the two doses of Ambi@@ ani ( although you / her child may not feel uncomfortable or ill ) vacc@@ ination may not prevent a disease .
protection against other infections that cause the liver damage or cause symptoms similar to those after hepatitis B or Hepatitis B infection cannot be medi@@ ated .
&quot; • If an allergic reaction to Ambi@@ rix or any part of this vaccine , including ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( an antibiotic ) , has already shown to you / your child . &quot;
&quot; allergic reaction may be caused by it@@ chy skin r@@ ashes , short@@ ness of breath or swelling of the face or tongue . • If you have already an allergic reaction to an earlier vacc@@ ination against hepatitis A or hepatitis B , if you / your child has a severe infection with fever / has . &quot;
&quot; • If you would like to have a high level of protection against hepatitis B ( i.e. , within 6 months and prior to the regular dose of the second vacc@@ ination ) . &quot;
&quot; at a potential risk of hepatitis B infection , between the first and second vacc@@ ination , the doctor will advise you / your child from vacc@@ ination with Ambi@@ rix . &quot;
&quot; instead , he / she will recommend 3 inj@@ ections of a combined hepatitis B / Hepatitis B vaccine with a reduced content of effective constitu@@ ents per vaccine ( 360 ELISA units of a form@@ al@@ in@@ in@@ activated hepatitis A virus and 10 micro@@ grams of re@@ combin@@ ant hepatitis B surface an@@ tigen ) . &quot;
the second vacc@@ ination dosage of this vaccine with reduced content of effective components is usually given one month after the first dose and is likely to give you / your child a vaccine prior to the end of the vacc@@ ination series .
&quot; sometimes , Ambi@@ ani is inj@@ ected by persons suffering from severe bleeding disorders , under the skin and not in the muscle . • If you / your child are weakened due to a disease or treatment in your / his / her body &apos;s def@@ ences / is or if you / her child is undergoing a hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis . &quot;
&quot; Ambi@@ ani can be given in these cases , but the immune response of these individuals on vacc@@ ination may not be sufficient so that a blood test may be necessary to see how strongly the reaction to vacc@@ ination is . &quot;
21 Tell your doctor if you / she / she / she / she / she / she / she has been vacc@@ inated ( including those you have been vacc@@ inated without prescription ) or if you have been given vacc@@ ines or immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins ( antibodies ) or has been planned in the near future .
&quot; however , it may be that in this case the immune response to the vaccine is not sufficient and the person is therefore not protected against one or both hepatitis A and B viruses . &quot;
&quot; if another vaccine needs to be given at the same time with Ambi@@ ani , it should be vacc@@ inated in separate areas and as different extre@@ mi@@ ties as possible . &quot;
&quot; if Ambi@@ ani is to be administered at the same time or shortly before or after injection of immun@@ o@@ glob@@ ul@@ ins , it is likely that the reaction to the vaccine will nevertheless be sufficient . &quot;
&quot; typically , Ambi@@ ani pregnant women or nursing women will not be given , unless it is urgent that they are vacc@@ inated against hepatitis A and hepatitis B. &quot;
important information about certain other components of Ambi@@ ani Please tell your doctor if you have already shown an allergic reaction to Ne@@ om@@ y@@ cin ( antibiotic ) in your child .
&quot; if you miss the agreed date for the second vacc@@ ination , talk to your doctor and arrange a new date as soon as possible . &quot;
♦ very often ( more than 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • P@@ ain or discomfort on the insertion point or redness • Mat@@ eness • Rei@@ z@@ ability • headache • lack of appetite
♦ frequently ( up to 1 case per 10 dec@@ im@@ ated doses ) : • swelling at the injection point • fever ( over 38 ° C ) • Di@@ zz@@ iness • gastro@@ intestinal complaints
&quot; other side effects , which were reported in days or weeks after vacc@@ ination with comparable combination or individual vacc@@ ines against hepatitis A and hepatitis B ( less than 1 case per 10,000 recycled doses ) , are : &quot;
&quot; these include spati@@ ally limited or expanded r@@ ashes that can be it@@ chy or b@@ low@@ ish , swelling of the eye part and face , difficult breathing or swal@@ lowing , sudden blood pressure drop and un@@ consciousness . &quot;

23 Please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if one of the listed side effects you / your child substantially affects or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this package .
Ambi@@ rix is available in packs of 1 and 10 with or without need@@ les and in packs of 50 without need@@ les .
&quot; on the basis of the data , which have been known since the issu@@ ance of the first permit for the market , the CH@@ MP suggested that the benefit @-@ risk ratio for Ambi@@ rix remains positive . &quot;
&quot; however , since Ambi@@ ani was in circulation only in a Member State ( in the Netherlands since May 2003 ) , the available safety data for this medicine is limited due to the low patient exposure . &quot;
ammon@@ ia can also be used in patients aged over a month with in@@ comprehensive enzyme defect or hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy ( brain damage due to high ammon@@ ia concentrations ) in pre@@ history .
&quot; ammon@@ ia is - divided into several individual doses to the meals - swal@@ lowed , mixed under the food or administered via a gastro@@ stom@@ ia ( through the abdominal wall into the stomach &apos;s leading hose ) or a nas@@ al probe ( through the nose into the stomach of leading hose ) . &quot;
&quot; it was not a comparative study , since Am@@ mon@@ soon could not be compared with any other treatment or placebo ( a pseudo @-@ medication , i.e. without active substance ) . &quot;
&quot; ammon@@ ia can also lead to loss of appetite , abnormal aci@@ dity in the blood , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , fluid retention , stomach pain , vom@@ iting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , rash , unpleasant body odor or weight gain . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that Am@@ mon@@ soon in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle effectively prevented high ammon@@ ia levels .
&quot; Am@@ mon@@ soon was approved under &quot; exceptional circumstances , &quot; since only limited information is available for this medicine at the time of admission . &quot;
&quot; the use is indicated in all patients , in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in new@@ bor@@ ns ( within the first 28 live days ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ man@@ ned form ( incomplete enzyme defect , which mani@@ f@@ ests itself after the first months of life ) , there is an indication for use when hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy is present in the an@@ am@@ n@@ esis . &quot;
&quot; for infants , for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is also available in gran@@ ular form . &quot;
the daily dose is calculated individually with respect to protein intoler@@ ance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient &apos;s growth and development .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ ate phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
patients with ar@@ gin@@ in@@ os@@ u@@ cc@@ in@@ at@@ syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase deficiency must obtain ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.@@ 7 g / kg / day or 8.@@ 8 - 15.@@ 4 g / m ² / day .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swal@@ lowing , because there is a risk for the formation of es@@ op@@ hag@@ us ul@@ cer@@ a if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach . &quot;
&quot; each tablet AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS contains 62 mg ( 2.7 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; therefore , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with caution in patients with con@@ ges@@ tive heart failure or severe ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency and with sodium retention and ede@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; since metabolism and ex@@ cre@@ tion of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat over the liver and kidneys is carried out , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or ren@@ al in@@ suffici@@ ency . &quot;
the importance of these results in pregnant women is not known ; the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS during pregnancy is therefore contra@@ indicated ( see 4.3 ) .
&quot; in sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate to young rats in high doses ( 190 - 4@@ 74 mg / kg ) , there was a slow@@ down of neur@@ onal proliferation and increased loss of neur@@ ons . &quot;
there was also a delayed mat@@ ur@@ ation of cereb@@ ral syn@@ ap@@ ses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth .
&quot; it could not be as@@ cer@@ tained whether phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is ex@@ cre@@ ted in humans in breast milk , and for this reason the use of AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS is contra@@ indicated during the lac@@ tation period ( see 4.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; in clinical trials with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , 56 % of patients had at least one adverse event ( AE ) and 78 % of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS . &quot;
&quot; the frequency is defined as follows : very common ( ≥ 1 / 10 ) , often ( ≥ 1 / 100 , &lt; 1 / 10 ) and occasionally ( ≥ 1 / 1000 , &lt; 1 / 100 ) . &quot;
&quot; an prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed metabolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tic tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
a case of over@@ dosage occurred in a 5 @-@ month @-@ old to@@ dd@@ ler with an accidental single dose of 10 g ( 13@@ 70 mg / kg ) .
these symptoms coinci@@ de with the accumulation of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate which showed a dose @-@ limiting neur@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity in intraven@@ ous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate is a met@@ abo@@ li@@ zed active compound con@@ ju@@ gated by acet@@ yl@@ ation with glut@@ amine to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine which is ex@@ cre@@ ted via the kidneys .
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess nitrogen .
5 patients suffering from the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of sodium phen@@ ylene but@@ y@@ rat between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
it is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome .
the pro@@ g@@ nosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in new@@ bor@@ ns was almost always inf@@ au@@ st and the disease itself led to death in the treatment with per@@ it@@ one@@ al di@@ aly@@ sis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen @-@ free analo@@ gues within the first year of life .
&quot; through hem@@ odi@@ aly@@ sis , the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen ex@@ cre@@ tion ( sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , sodium ben@@ zo@@ ate and sodium phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ) , protein @-@ reduced food and possibly sub@@ stitution of essential amino acids , it was possible to increase the survival rate of new@@ bor@@ ns in post@@ part@@ al ( but within the first months of life ) to 80 % . &quot;
&quot; in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and they were treated before the first appearance of hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy , the survival rate was 100 % , but even in those patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neuro@@ logical defic@@ its . &quot;
&quot; in patients with a late @-@ man@@ ent form of the disease ( including female patients with the hetero@@ zy@@ g@@ ous form of the Or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e deficiency ) , which were recovered from hyper@@ ammon@@ ia en@@ cephal@@ opathy and treated permanently with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and a protein @-@ reduced diet , the survival rate was 98 % . &quot;
already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur .
&quot; it is known that phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is oxi@@ di@@ zed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate , which is con@@ ju@@ gated in liver and kidneys with glut@@ amine , whereby phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is produced . &quot;
&quot; the concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites in plasma and urine were determined after the dose of an individual dose of 5 g sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in so@@ ber healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle , ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in metabolism and recur@@ rent doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day ( non @-@ controlled trials ) . &quot;
the behaviour of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat and its metabol@@ ites was also examined in cancer patients after the intraven@@ ous administration of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( up to 2 g / m ² ) or phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate .
&quot; after an oral dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in tablet form , measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were observed 15 minutes after the intake . &quot;
&quot; in the majority of patients with ur@@ ic cycle disorders or ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in , phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 300 @-@ 650 mg / kg / day up to 20 g / day ) in the next morning after a ni@@ gh@@ tly fast no phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate in plasma was det@@ ectable . &quot;
&quot; in three out of six patients with cir@@ rho@@ sis of the liver , which were repeatedly treated with sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ( 20 g / day or@@ ally in three single doses ) , the medium @-@ sized phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate concentrations in the plasma are five times higher than after the first gifts . &quot;

&quot; according to the results of the Mic@@ ron@@ u@@ cle@@ us test , sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat did not treat rats treated with toxic and non @-@ toxic doses ( examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 8@@ 78 to 28@@ 00 mg / kg ) . &quot;
AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate is taken either or@@ ally ( infants and children who cannot swallow tablets or give patients with swal@@ lowing ) or via a gastro@@ stom@@ ia or a nas@@ al probe .
&quot; according to previous clinical experience , the normal daily dose of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat : • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day for new@@ born infants , infants and children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,@@ 9 - 13,@@ 0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of ammon@@ ia , ar@@ gin@@ ine , essential amino acids ( especially bran@@ ched chain amino acids ) , car@@ nit@@ ine and serum protein in the plasma should be kept within the normal area . &quot;
the sub@@ stitution of cit@@ rul@@ line or ar@@ gin@@ ine in a dosage of 0.@@ 17 g / kg / day or 3.@@ 8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Car@@ bam@@ ate phosph@@ ate syn@@ th@@ et@@ ase or or@@ ni@@ in@@ tran@@ scar@@ bam@@ y@@ las@@ e .
&quot; AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS gran@@ ulate contains 124 mg ( 5.@@ 4 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per gram of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , corresponding to 2.5 g ( 108 m@@ mo@@ l ) sodium per 20 g of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat , which corresponds to the maximum daily dose . &quot;
&quot; when rat tur@@ tles were exposed to phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ ate ( active metabol@@ ite of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat ) before the birth , there were les@@ ions in the pyramid cells of the brain cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; an prob@@ able toxic reaction to AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS ( 450 mg / kg / day ) was reported by a 18 @-@ year @-@ old anor@@ ec@@ tic patient who developed metabolic En@@ cephal@@ opathy in conjunction with lac@@ tic tin , severe hypo@@ kal@@ emia , tank top@@ en@@ ia , peripheral neu@@ rop@@ athy and pancre@@ atitis . &quot;
phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine ( both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms ) ; phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for ex@@ cre@@ tion of excess .
on the basis of studies on ex@@ cre@@ tion of phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine in patients with disorders of the ure@@ a cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phen@@ ylene but@@ y@@ rat can be produced between 0.@@ 12 and 0.@@ 15 g phen@@ yl@@ acet@@ yl@@ glut@@ amine .
&quot; already existing neuro@@ logical defic@@ its are hardly rever@@ sible for treatment , and a further deterioration of the neuro@@ logical condition can occur in some patients . &quot;
&quot; after an oral dose of 5 grams of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat in gran@@ ulated form , measurable plasma concentrations of phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat were observed 15 minutes after the intake . &quot;
&quot; during the duration of the durability , the patient can store the finished product for a period of 3 months at a temperature of less than 25 ° C. &quot;
&quot; this procedure contains the small measuring spoon 0.@@ 95 g , the mean measuring sco@@ op of 2.@@ 9 g and the large measuring sco@@ op of 8.@@ 6 g of sodium phen@@ ylene but@@ y@@ rat . &quot;
&quot; if a patient has to receive the medication via a probe , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS can also be dissolved in water before use ( the sol@@ ubil@@ ity of sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat is up to 5 g in 10 ml of water ) . &quot;
&quot; in patients with these rare diseases , certain liver enzymes are missing , so that they cannot ex@@ crete the nitrogen @-@ containing waste products that accumulate in the body after consuming proteins . &quot;
&quot; if laboratory tests are carried out at you , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
&quot; during the lac@@ tation period , you should not take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , as the medicine may enter the breast milk and damage your baby . &quot;
&quot; in rare cases , confusion , head@@ aches , taste disorders , leaving the ear , dis@@ orientation , memory problems and worsen@@ ing of existing neuro@@ logical conditions have also been observed . &quot;
&quot; if you find one of these symptoms , immediately contact your doctor or the emergency room of your hospital for the purpose of initiation of appropriate treatment . &quot;
&quot; if you forgot taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , take the appropriate dose as soon as possible with the next meal . &quot;
&quot; changes in the blood type ( red blood cells , white blood cells , thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cytes ) , decreased appetite , depression , irrit@@ ability , headache , f@@ ain@@ ting , nausea , con@@ sti@@ pation , unpleasant skin smell , rash , ren@@ al dysfunction , weight gain and abnormal laboratory values . &quot;
please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if any of the listed side effects will adver@@ sely affect you or you notice any side effects that are not stated in this information information .
&quot; after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date , AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS will no longer be able to use AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS after the exp@@ ir@@ ation date specified . &quot;
&quot; as AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS looks and content of the package AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS tablets are of whi@@ tish color and oval shape , and they are provided with the embos@@ sing &quot; U@@ C@@ Y 500 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; 30 If laboratory tests are carried out at you , you must tell the doctor that you are taking AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS , because sodium phen@@ yl@@ but@@ y@@ rat may affect the results of certain laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; if you take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS with other medicines please inform your doctor or pharmac@@ ist if you have taken other medicines or have recently taken it , even if it is not prescription medicine . &quot;
they should take AM@@ MO@@ NA@@ PS evenly on the same single doses or via a ga@@ stri@@ c fi@@ st@@ ula ( hose which runs through the abdominal wall directly into the stomach ) or a nas@@ al probe ( hose which is led through the nose into the stomach ) .
&quot; • Take from the container a he@@ aped measuring spoon of gran@@ ulate . • Fol@@ low a straight edge , e.g. a knife back over the top edge of the knife , to remove excess powder . • Take the recommended amount of measuring sco@@ op of gran@@ ulate from the container . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to treat adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S , reduced blood supply to the heart ) , for example in unstable ang@@ ina ( a form of pain in the chest with different starch ) or m@@ yo@@ car@@ dial inf@@ ar@@ ction ( heart attack ) without &quot; &quot; stress &quot; &quot; ( an anom@@ al@@ ous measured value of the electro@@ cardi@@ ogram or EC@@ G ) . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox is used to prevent blood cl@@ ots in patients undergoing a PCI , a higher dose is administered and the in@@ fusion can be continued up to four hours after the procedure . &quot;
this can help patients with ang@@ ina or heart attack to maintain blood flow to the heart and increase the effectiveness of a PCI .
&quot; approximately 14 000 patients participated in the main study on the treatment of AC@@ S , in which the effect of angi@@ ox in combination with a gly@@ cop@@ rot@@ ein II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( G@@ PI ) was compared to conventional combination treatment with He@@ par@@ in ( another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ) and a G@@ PI . &quot;
&quot; during the PCI , patients were often employed ( a short tube left in the ar@@ tery to prevent closure ) and additionally received other medicines to prevent blood cl@@ ots , such as c@@ xi@@ mab and aspir@@ in . &quot;
&quot; in the treatment of AC@@ S , angi@@ ox - with or without the gift of G@@ PI - was as effective in preventing new events ( deaths , heart attacks or re@@ as@@ cul@@ arization ) after 30 days or a year as usual as conventional treatment . &quot;
&quot; in patients undergoing a PCI , angi@@ ox in relation to all indicators was as effective as He@@ par@@ in , except for severe bleeding , in which it was significantly more effective than He@@ par@@ in . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ dine , other Hi@@ ru@@ dine or any of the other ingredients . &quot;
&quot; it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding , as well as for people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection . &quot;
the Committee on Medic@@ inal Products for Human Use ( CH@@ MP ) concluded that angi@@ ox is an acceptable substitute for He@@ par@@ in during the treatment of AC@@ S and during a PCI .
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the Medic@@ ines Company UK Ltd to author@@ ise the transport of angi@@ ox in the entire European Union . &quot;
for the treatment of adult patients with acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) with an emergency intervention or if an early intervention is provided .
the recommended initial dose of angi@@ ox in patients with AC@@ S is an intraven@@ ous dose of 0.1 mg / kg followed by an in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h .
&quot; if a PCI is carried out in another row , an additional bolt of 0.5 mg / kg should be given and the in@@ fusion can be increased to 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
&quot; after the PCI , the reduced in@@ fusion dose of 0.@@ 25 mg / kg / h can be resum@@ ed for 4 to 12 hours after clinical requirements . &quot;
&quot; immediately before the operation , a maximum of 0.5 mg / kg should be administered , followed by an in@@ fusion of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg / h for the duration of the operation . &quot;
the recommended dose of angi@@ ox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion of 0.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intraven@@ ous in@@ fusion with a dose of 1.@@ 75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery .
the safety and efficacy of a certain type of Bol@@ us @-@ administration of angi@@ ox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned .
&quot; if this value ( ACT after 5 minutes ) is shortened to less than 225 seconds , a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values , the re@@ constituted and dil@@ uted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and the dose is quickly administered intraven@@ ously . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds , further monitoring is no longer required , provided that the 1.@@ 75 mg / kg in@@ fusion dose is given correctly . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney function restriction ( GF@@ R 30 @-@ 59 ml / min ) , which are subjected to a PCI ( whether treated with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din versus AC@@ S or not ) , a lower in@@ fusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used . &quot;
&quot; if the ACT value is less than 225 seconds , a second dose dose of 0.3 mg / kg is to be given and the ACT 5 minutes after the second dose dose is checked again . &quot;
&quot; in patients with moderate kidney damage , which were included in the II@@ I@@ - PCI study ( RE@@ PLA@@ CE @-@ 2 ) , which led to approval , the ACT value was 5 minutes after the gift of the Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din @-@ Bol@@ us without dose adjustment at an average 3@@ 66 ± 89 seconds . &quot;
3 In patients with severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and also in di@@ aly@@ sis patients angi@@ ox is contra@@ indicated ( see section 4.3 ) .
treatment with angi@@ ox can be initiated 30 minutes after the intraven@@ ous administration of non @-@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or 8 hours after the cut@@ aneous administration of the sub@@ cut@@ aneous administration of low @-@ molecular He@@ par@@ in .
• serious hyper@@ sensitivity to the drug or other constitu@@ ents or against hi@@ ru@@ dine • active bleeding or increased blood risk due to a mal@@ functioning of the hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis system and / or irre@@ ver@@ sible bacterial endo@@ cardi@@ tis . • severe kidney damage ( GF@@ R &lt; 30 ml / min ) and for di@@ aly@@ sis patients
patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially if bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is administered in combination with another anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ant ( see section 4.5 ) .
&quot; even if the majority of bleeding in arter@@ ial oc@@ cl@@ usal positions occur in patients with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , patients who undergo a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) may occur throughout the treatment throughout all hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; in patients who are taking war@@ far@@ in and being treated with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , a monitoring of the IN@@ R ( International Reg@@ ised R@@ atio ) should be considered to ensure that the value after sett@@ ling the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is again reached the level before the treatment . &quot;
&quot; based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants ( He@@ par@@ in , War@@ far@@ in , Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ oly@@ tics or thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggregates ) , these substances can increase the risk of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in combination of bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din with thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ te aggreg@@ ators or anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ ants , the clinical and biological hem@@ o@@ sta@@ sis parameters are regularly monitored . &quot;
&quot; the animal experimental investigations are insufficient in relation to the effects on pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , binding or post @-@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
46@@ 12 were random@@ ised to Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din alone ; 4@@ 60@@ 4 were random@@ ized to Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or and 4@@ 60@@ 3 were random@@ ized to either non @-@ frac@@ tional He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a In@@ hibit@@ or .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din group and the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years more often came to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
severe bleeding were defined according to AC@@ U@@ ITY and Tim@@ i standards for severe bleeding as in table 2 foot@@ notes .
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently than in groups of he@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or ( see table 2 ) .
&quot; AC@@ U@@ ITY serious hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge was defined as one of the following events : intra@@ cran@@ ial , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , intra@@ ocular hem@@ or@@ r@@ ha@@ ge or bleeding in the point area , reducing ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in levels ≥ 3 g / dl with a well @-@ known hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in mirror , re@@ operation due to bleeding , application of blood products to trans@@ fusion . &quot;
&quot; other , less frequently observed bleeding loc@@ al@@ isations , which occurred with more than 0.1 % ( occasionally ) , were &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; spots , retro@@ per@@ it@@ one@@ al , gastro@@ intestinal , ear , nose or neck . &quot;
the following information on side effects is based on the data of a clinical trial with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din in 6000 patients undergoing a PCI .
&quot; in both the Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din group and the comparison groups treated with He@@ par@@ in , women and patients over 65 years more often came to adverse events than in male or younger patients . &quot;
both light and severe bleeding occurred significantly less frequently in the comparison group under He@@ par@@ in plus GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or .
&quot; the following side effects , which are not listed above , were reported after extensive application in practice and are grouped by system organ classes in table 6 . &quot;
&quot; in case of over@@ dose , the treatment with bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is immediately broken off and the patient is closely mes@@ h@@ ed with regard to signs of bleeding . &quot;
&quot; angi@@ ox contains bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din , a direct and specific thro@@ m@@ bin@@ inhibit@@ or , which bin@@ ds both at the cataly@@ tic centre and the ani@@ on @-@ bond region of Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in , regardless of whether thro@@ mb@@ in is bound in the liquid phase or on a cl@@ ots . &quot;
&quot; the binding of bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din to thro@@ mb@@ in , and there@@ with its effect , is rever@@ sible , because Th@@ ro@@ mb@@ in re@@ generates the binding of Bi@@ vali@@ ru@@ din @-@ AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ Pro@@ 4 , thus re@@ generating the function of the active centre of thro@@ mb@@ in . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , a thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / he@@ par@@ ine @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ie / he@@ par@@ ine @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis syndrome ( H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS ) was not induced by bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din in patients with serum @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ cy@@ top@@ en@@ ia / he@@ par@@ ine @-@ induced thro@@ m@@ bo@@ sis syndrome . &quot;
&quot; in healthy subjects and in patients , bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din shows a dose and concentration @-@ dependent anti@@ coag@@ ul@@ atory effect , which is substanti@@ ated by the extension of ACT , a@@ PT@@ T , PT , IN@@ R and TT . &quot;
&quot; if a PCI was carried out below , an additional bolt of 0,@@ 5@@ mg / kg of bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din should be given and the in@@ fusion for the duration of the surgery can be increased to 1,@@ 75@@ mg / kg / h . &quot;
&quot; in the Arm A of the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , non @-@ frac@@ tion@@ ated He@@ par@@ in or E@@ no@@ x@@ apar@@ in was administered in accordance with the relevant guidelines for the treatment of acute cor@@ on@@ ary syndrome ( AC@@ S ) in patients with unstable ang@@ ina / non @-@ ST lifting inf@@ ar@@ ction ( IA / N@@ STE@@ MI ) . &quot;
patients in arm A and B were also random@@ ised to obtain a GP@@ II@@ b / II@@ I@@ a inhibit@@ or either before the onset of angi@@ ography ( at the time of random@@ isation ) or in the PCI .
&quot; in the AC@@ U@@ ITY study , the characteristics of high @-@ risk patients , which required angi@@ ography within 72 hours , were distributed evenly over the 3 treatment arms . &quot;
&quot; about 77 % of patients had recur@@ rent isch@@ emia , 70 % had dynamic EK@@ G@@ - changes or increased cardiac biom@@ ark@@ ers , 28 % had diabetes and about 99 % of all patients underwent angi@@ ography within 72 hours . &quot;
the primary analysis and results from the AC@@ U@@ ITY study for the 30 @-@ day and the 1- year end@@ point for the overall population ( IT@@ T ) and for the patients receiving aspir@@ in and clo@@ pi@@ do@@ gre@@ l according to protocol ( before angi@@ ography or before the PCI ) are presented in tables 7 and 8 .

clinical trials with a small number of patients provided limited information on the use of angi@@ ox in patients with H@@ IT / H@@ IT@@ TS .
the pharmac@@ ok@@ ine@@ tic properties of Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din were evaluated in patients with a perc@@ ut@@ aneous cor@@ on@@ ary intervention ( PCI ) as well as in patients with AC@@ S .
&quot; as a pep@@ tide , Bi@@ vali@@ d@@ din is expected to pass a cat@@ abol@@ ism into its amino acid components with subsequent re@@ valuation of amino acids in the body pool . &quot;
the primary metabol@@ ite resulting from the split of the AR@@ G@@ 3 @-@ pro@@ 4 binding of the N @-@ terminal sequence through thro@@ mb@@ in is not effective due to the loss of its aff@@ inity to the cataly@@ tic centre of thro@@ mb@@ in .
the elimination takes place in patients with normal ren@@ al function after a first order process with a termin@@ ale half @-@ life of 25 ± 12 minutes .
&quot; based on conventional studies on safety pharmac@@ ology , toxic@@ ity in repeated administration , gen@@ ot@@ ox@@ ic@@ ity or reproductive toxic@@ ity , prec@@ lin@@ ical data do not reveal any particular danger to humans . &quot;
toxic@@ ity in animals with repeated or continuous exposure ( 1 day to 4 weeks at exposure to 10 @-@ fold of the clinical ste@@ ady state plasma concentration ) was limited to im@@ position pharmac@@ ological effects .
side effects due to long @-@ term physiological strain as a reaction to non @-@ home@@ ost@@ atic coag@@ ulation were not observed after short term exposure comparable to those in clinical application even at very much higher doses .

&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is used for the treatment of adults , adolescents and children over six years with diabetes that require treatment with insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra is inj@@ ected sub@@ cut@@ aneous ( under the skin ) into the abdominal wall , th@@ igh or upper arm or administered as a permanent in@@ fusion with an insulin pump . &quot;
diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin for regulating the glucose level ( sugar ) in the blood or the insulin cannot process effectively .
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in differs very margin@@ ally from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter period of active insulin than a short @-@ acting human insulin .
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra was studied in combination with a long @-@ acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes , in which the body cannot produce insulin , in two studies with a total of 1,@@ 5@@ 49 adults and in a study involving 5@@ 72 children aged between four and 17 years . &quot;
&quot; in type 2 diabetes , in which the body cannot be effectively processed , A@@ pi@@ dra has been studied in a study involving 8@@ 78 adults . &quot;
the main indicator of the efficacy was the change in the concentration of the substance gly@@ cos@@ yl@@ ated ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in ( H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c ) in the blood that indicates how well the blood sugar is set .
&quot; in the first study of adults with type 1 diabetes , decreased by 0.@@ 14 % ( from 7.@@ 60 % to 7.@@ 46 % ) compared to a reduction of 0.@@ 14 % compared to insulin l@@ is@@ pro . &quot;
&quot; in adults with type 2 diabetes , the reduction in H@@ b@@ A@@ 1@@ c concentration was 0.@@ 46 % after six months with A@@ pi@@ dra compared to 0.@@ 30 % in human normal insulin . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra may not be used in patients who may be hyper@@ sensitive ( allergic ) to insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in or any of the other ingredients , or in patients who are already suffering from hypo@@ gly@@ c@@ emia . &quot;
&quot; the dos@@ ages of A@@ pi@@ dra may be adjusted if it is administered together with a number of other medicines , which can affect blood glucose levels . &quot;
&quot; in September 2004 , the European Commission issued a permit to the company San@@ of@@ i @-@ Av@@ entis Deutschland GmbH for the transport of A@@ pi@@ dra in the entire European Union . &quot;
&quot; A@@ pi@@ dra can be applied as sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection either in the area of abdominal wall , th@@ igh or delta muscle or sub@@ cut@@ aneous by continuous in@@ fusion in the area of the stomach @-@ cke . &quot;
&quot; due to decreased glucose capacity and reduced insulin metabolism , insulin requirements in patients with a reduction in liver function can be reduced . &quot;
&quot; the type of insulin ( animal insulin ) and / or the manufacturing method can result in a change in insulin requirements . &quot;
&quot; 3 An inadequate dosage or termination of treatment , especially in patients with insulin @-@ based diabetes , can lead to hyper@@ gly@@ c@@ emia and diabe@@ tic k@@ eto@@ aci@@ dosis ; these conditions are potentially life @-@ threatening . &quot;
the conversion of a patient to another insulin type or an insulin produced by another manufacturer should take place under strict medical supervision and can necess@@ itate a change in the dosage .
&quot; the time of occurrence of hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia depends on the active ingredient of the insulin used , and can therefore change at the conversion of the treatment scheme . &quot;
&quot; the substances that increase blood sugar lowering activity and increase the prop@@ ens@@ ity to hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias are oral anti@@ diabe@@ tic , angi@@ ot@@ ens@@ in @-@ con@@ ver@@ ting enzyme ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , mono@@ amine oxid@@ ase ( MA@@ O ) inhibit@@ ors , hypo@@ gly@@ phs , sal@@ ic@@ yl@@ ates and sul@@ fon@@ amide antibiotics . &quot;
&quot; in addition , under the action of sympath@@ iz@@ oly@@ tics such as beta block@@ ers , C@@ lon@@ i@@ din , Gu@@ an@@ thi@@ din and reser@@ pine , the symptoms of the adren@@ ergi@@ c counter @-@ regulation can be wat@@ ered or missing . &quot;
&quot; experimental studies on reproductive toxic@@ ity showed no differences between in@@ su@@ - ling@@ l@@ ul@@ is@@ ine and human insulin in relation to pregnancy , embry@@ onic / fet@@ al development , birth or post@@ nat@@ al development ( see section 5.3 ) . &quot;
&quot; it is not known whether insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in occurs in human breast milk , but in general insulin is neither absorbed into breast milk nor is it resor@@ bed to oral application . &quot;
&quot; the following are listed from clinical trials reported adverse drug prices grouped by system organ classes and sorted by decreasing frequency of their occurrence ( very common : ≥ 1 / 10 ; rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : ≥ 1 / 10,000 , &lt; 1 / 10 ; very rare : &lt; 1 / 10 ) ; not known ( frequency based on available data ) . &quot;
&quot; cold - sweat , cool and pale skin , fatigue , nerv@@ ousness or trem@@ bling , anxiety , unusual exhaus@@ tion or weakness , confusion , concentration disorders , di@@ zz@@ iness , excessive bleeding , headache , nausea and pal@@ pit@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy Is neglected to continuously change the injection site within the injection area , can result in a li@@ pod@@ yst@@ ro@@ phy at the injection site . &quot;
severe hypo@@ gly@@ cem@@ ias associated with un@@ consciousness can be treated by an intra@@ muscular or sub@@ cut@@ aneous injection of glu@@ c@@ agon ( 0.5 to 1 mg ) administered by a correspon@@ dingly trained person or by an intraven@@ ous dose of glucose by a doctor .
&quot; after a glu@@ cos@@ ine injection , the patient should be monitored in a hospital to determine the cause of severe hypo@@ gly@@ ca@@ emia and to avoid similar episodes . &quot;
insulin lowers blood sugar levels by stimulating the peripheral blood glucose intake ( especially through skel@@ etal muscles and fat ) as well as by inhibit@@ ing glucose production in the liver .
studies with healthy volunteers and patients with diabetes have shown that insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ ines occur more quickly in the case of sub@@ cut@@ aneous ga@@ si@@ fication and the duration of the active insulin is shorter than with a normal insulin .
&quot; in a study with 18 male subjects ranging from 21 to 50 years of age with type 1 diabetes mel@@ li@@ - tus , insulin gran@@ ules in the therapeu@@ tically relevant dosing range showed a dispro@@ portion@@ ate glu@@ cos@@ ine effect , and 0.3 mg / kg or more a dispro@@ portion@@ ate increase in the glu@@ cos@@ ine effect , just like human insulin . &quot;
insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in has a twice as fast response as normal human insulin and achieves complete glu@@ cos@@ al effect about 2 hours earlier than insulin insulin .
&quot; the data was evident that in an application of insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in 2 minutes before the meal , a similar post @-@ den@@ ounced gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 30 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in was obtained 2 minutes before the meal , a better post @-@ den@@ ounced control was achieved than with human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes before the meal . &quot;
&quot; if insulin is turned 15 minutes after the start of the meal , a similar gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control is achieved , as with human normal insulin , which is given 2 mi@@ ds before the meal ( see Figure 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at intake 2 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - previously ) before the beginning of the meal was given in comparison to human normal insulin , which was given 30 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - 30 min ) prior to the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1A ) and compared to human normal insulin , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before a meal ( Figure 1@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; insulin l@@ ul@@ is@@ in at intake 15 minutes ( G@@ LU@@ L@@ IS@@ IN - afterwards ) after the beginning of the meal compared to human normal @-@ mal@@ ine , which was given 2 minutes ( NOR@@ MA@@ L - before ) before the beginning of the meal ( Figure 1@@ C ) . &quot;
