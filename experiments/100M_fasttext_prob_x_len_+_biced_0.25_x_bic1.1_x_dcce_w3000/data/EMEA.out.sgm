<seg id="4">"it is available as 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 30 mg tablets, 10 mg, 15 mg and 30 mg of processed tablets (tablets that dissolve in the mouth), as a solution to intake (1 mg / ml) and as an injection solution (7.5 mg / ml)."</seg>
<seg id="5">"B. Creating thinking and speaking, hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not present), distrust and delusion; • Bipolar I disorder, a mental illness in which the patients have manic episodes (periods of abnormal high-tuning) alternating with periods of normal tuning."</seg>
<seg id="6">Abilify is used to treat moderate to severe manic episodes and to prevent manic episodes in patients who have addressed the medicine in the past.</seg>
<seg id="7">The injection solution is used for quick control of increased restlessness or behavioural disturbances when the oral consumption of the medicine is not possible.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in both diseases, the solution to inhale or the melting tablets can be used in patients who have difficulty swallowing tablets."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in patients who use other medicines at the same time, the same as Abilify should be adjusted, the dose of Abilify should be adjusted."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this impairs the signal transmission between brain cells by" neurotransmitters, "i.e., chemical substances that allow the communication of nerve cells to each other."</seg>
<seg id="11">Aripiprazole is believed to be a "partial agony" for the neurotransmitter dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin (also called serotonin).</seg>
<seg id="12">"this means that Aripiprazole acts like 5-hydroxytryptamin and dopamine, but less than the neurotransmitters to activate the receptors."</seg>
<seg id="13">"as dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamin play a role in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, Aripiprazl contributes to normalize the activity of the brain, thus preventing psychotic or manic symptoms and preventing their recurrence."</seg>
<seg id="14">The efficacy of Abilify to prevent reoccurrence of symptoms has been studied in three studies for up to one year.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the efficacy of the injection solution was compared in two studies in 805 patients with schizophrenia or similar diseases, which were suffering from increased unrest, over a period of two hours compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in another study, Abilify was compared over twelve weeks to 347 patients with haloperidol, in another study the efficacy of Abilify and placebo, which had been stabilized to 160 patients in which the manic symptoms were already stabilized with Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="17">The efficacy of Abilify injection solution was compared in a study to 301 patients with bipolar disorder which suffered from increased unrest with the treatment of Lorazepam (another antipsychotic medicine) and placebo over a period of two hours.</seg>
<seg id="18">All studies examined the change in patients "symptoms based on a standard scale for bipolar disorder or the number of patients who responded to the treatment.</seg>
<seg id="19">The company also conducted studies to examine how the body absorbs the melting tablets and the solution to inhaling (absorbs).</seg>
<seg id="20">"in both studies with the injection solution, patients who received Abilify in doses of 5.25 mg, 9.75 mg, or 15 mg, significantly reduced the symptoms of increased unrest than the patients receiving placebo."</seg>
<seg id="21">"in the treatment of bipolar disorder, Abilify decreased in four of the five short-term studies of manic symptoms more effective than placebo."</seg>
<seg id="22">Abilify also prevented up to 74 weeks longer than placebo to prevent the recurrence of manic episodes in previously untreated patients and when administered in addition to an existing treatment.</seg>
<seg id="23">Abilify injections in 10- or 15 mg doses also reduced more effectively than placebo. symptoms increased restlessness and were similarly effective as Lorazepam.</seg>
<seg id="24">"the most common side effects of Abilify for taking (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are extrapyramidal disorders (uncontrolled), tremors, somnolence (nausea), vomiting, nausea, nausea, restlessness, insomnia (sleep disorders) and anxiety."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and from moderate to severe manic episodes in bipolar-I disorder, as well as in the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who spoke predominantly manic episodes and in which the manic episodes responded to the treatment with Aripiprazl, outweighed the risks."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in addition, the committee came to the conclusion that the benefits of the injection solution in the rapid control of increased restlessness and behavioural disturbances in patients with schizophrenia or in patients with manic episodes in bipolar-I-disorder, if oral therapy is not suitable, outweighs the risks."</seg>
<seg id="27">"in June 2004, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Otsuka Pharmaceutical Europe Ltd. approval for the use of Abilify in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="28">Abilify is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe manic episodes of bipolar disorder and for the prevention of a new manic episode in patients who had predominantly manic episodes and their manic episodes related to the treatment with Aripiprazl (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="29">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 10 or 15 mg / day at a maintenance dose of 15 mg / day once daily regardless of meals.</seg>
<seg id="30">"increased effectiveness in dosages above a daily dose of 15 mg was not proven, although individual patients can benefit from a higher dose."</seg>
<seg id="31">The recommended starting dose for Abilify is 15 mg once a day regardless of meals as monotherapy or combination therapy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="32">The efficacy of Abilify in the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in patients ≥ 65 years has not been proven.</seg>
<seg id="33">"with regard to the greater sensitivity of this group of patients, a lower initial dose should be considered when clinical factors justify this (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="34">"if the CYP3A4 inductor is removed from the combination therapy, the Aripiprazl dose should be reduced to the recommended dose (see section 4.5)."</seg>
<seg id="35">"the occurrence of suicidal behavior belongs to psychotic diseases and affective disorders and was reported in some cases after onset or change of an antipsychotic medication, also in treatment with Aripiprazol (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="36">Results of an epidemiological study showed that in patients with bipolar disorder there was no elevated risk of suicide associated with Aripiprazl compared to other antipsychotics.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Aripiprazole should be used with caution in patients with known cardiovascular diseases (myocardial infarction or ischemic heart disease, heart failure, overflow disturbances), cerebrovascular diseases, conditions that are predisposed for hypotonia (dehydration, hypovolemia, treatment with blood pressure lowering drugs) or hypertension (including acute and maligne form)."</seg>
<seg id="38">"3 Late dyskinesia: in clinical trials, which lasted one year or less, there were occasional reports of dyskinesia occurring during the treatment with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if symptoms and symptoms of late dyskinesia, treated with Abilify, should be considered, reduce the dose or break the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="40">"if a patient develops signs and symptoms that point to a mn, or unclear high fever without an additional clinical manifestation of mns, all antipsychotics, including Abilify, must be removed."</seg>
<seg id="41">"therefore, Aripiprazl should be used with caution in patients with seizures in the anamnesis or in conditions associated with varicose attacks."</seg>
<seg id="42">"56 - 99 years) with Aripiprazol in patients with Alzheimer's disease, patients who were treated with Aripiprazole had an increased risk of death compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="43">"however, there were in one of these trials, a study with a fixed dose, a significant relationship between the dosage and the response to undesirable cerebrovascular events in patients treated with Aripiprazol."</seg>
<seg id="44">"hyperglycemia, in some cases extremely and associated with ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar coma or death, was reported in patients treated with atypical antipsychotic drugs, including Abilify."</seg>
<seg id="45">There are no precise risk assessments for hyperglycaemia related adverse events in patients treated with Abilify and other atypical antipsychotic drugs to allow direct comparisons.</seg>
<seg id="46">"polydipsia, polyurry, polyphagy and weakness) are observed and patients with diabetes mellitus or with risk factors for diabetes mellitus should be monitored regularly with regard to a deterioration of glucose levels."</seg>
<seg id="47">"weight gain is generally observed in schizophrenic patients and patients with bipolar mania due to comorbidities, the use of antipsychotics, in which weight gain is known as side effects, or an unhealthy lifestyle and could lead to serious complications."</seg>
<seg id="48">"due to the primary action of Aripiprazl on the central nervous system, caution is advised if Aripiprazl is taken in combination with alcohol or other central effective drugs with overlying side effects such as sedation (see section 4.8)."</seg>
<seg id="49">"the H2 antagonist Famotidin, a gastric acid blocker, reduces the absorption rate of Aripiprazol, but this effect is considered clinically non-relevant."</seg>
<seg id="50">"in a clinical trial with healthy volunteers, a highly effective CYP2D6 inhibitor (Chinidine) increased the AUC of Aripiprazl by 107% while the CMAx remained unchanged."</seg>
<seg id="51">"other highly effective inhibitors of CYP2D6, like fluoxetine and paroxetine, have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made."</seg>
<seg id="52">"in CYP2D6 'bad' (=" poor ") metabolism, the common application with highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 can result in higher plasma concentrations of Aripiprazol in comparison to CYP2D6 extensive metabolites."</seg>
<seg id="53">"considering the joint administration of Ketoconazole or other highly effective CYP3A4 inhibitors with Abilify, potential benefits should be outweighed for the patient."</seg>
<seg id="54">Other highly effective inhibitors of CYP3A4 such as Itraconazole and HIV protease inhibitors may have similar effects and therefore similar dose reductions should be made.</seg>
<seg id="55">"after applying the CYP2D6- or 3A4 inhibitors, the dosage of Abilify should be lifted to the dose at the beginning of the accompanying therapy."</seg>
<seg id="56">Diltiazem or escitalopram or CYP2D6 together with Abilify can be expected with a moderate increase in Aripiprazol- concentrations.</seg>
<seg id="57">"in clinical trials, doses of 10-30 mg Aripiprazol showed no significant effect on the metabolites of the mediums of CYP2D6 (Dextromethorphan / 3-methoxymorphine ratio), 2C19 (Omeprazol) and 3A4 (Dextromethorph)."</seg>
<seg id="58">Patients should be advised to notify their doctor if they are pregnant or planning a pregnancy during the treatment with Aripiprazl.</seg>
<seg id="59">"due to the insufficient data base for human safety and due to the concerns raised in the reproduction studies in the animal, this medicine may not be used in pregnancy unless the potential benefits justifies the potential risk for the fetus."</seg>
<seg id="60">"however, as with other antipsychotics, patients should be warned against use dangerous machinery, including motor vehicles, until they are sure that Aripiprazl has no negative influence on them."</seg>

<seg id="71">"side effects reported in connection with an antipsychotic therapy and their incidence in the treatment with Aripiprazol include malignant neuroleptic syndrome, late dyskinesia and varicose attacks, unwanted cerebrovascular events and increased mortality in older dementia patients, hyperglycemia and diabetes mellitus (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="72">"in clinical trials and since the market launch, unintentional or deliberate acute overdosages with Aripiprazole were observed alone in adult patients with estimated doses of up to 1260 mg and without death."</seg>
<seg id="73">"although there is no information on the efficacy of a hemodialysis in the treatment of an overdose with Aripiprazol, it is unlikely that hemodialysis is beneficial in the treatment of an overdose as Aripiprazl has a high plasma-rotation attachment."</seg>
<seg id="74">It is thought that the efficacy of Aripiprazol in schizophrenia and bipolar-I disorder is mediated by combining a partial agonistic effect on dopamine D2- and serotonin 5HT1 receptors and an antagonistic effect on serotonin 5HT2a receptors.</seg>
<seg id="75">"Aripiprazole showed in vitro a high affinity to the dopamine D2- and D3 receptor, as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4- and 5HT2a receptor as well as a moderate affinity to the dopamine D4- and 5HT7-, alpha-1-adrenergic and histamine-H1receptor."</seg>

<seg id="77">"in three placebo-controlled short-term studies (4 to 6 weeks) to 1,228 schizophrenic patients with positive or negative symptoms, Aripiprazl showed a statistically significant improvement in the psychotic symptoms compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in a haloperidol-controlled study, 52 percent of respondents responded to the study medication in week 52 (Aripiprazl 77% and haloperidol 73%)."</seg>
<seg id="79">"current values of measured scales, defined as secondary study goals, including PANSS and Montgomery-Asberg- depression rates, showed a significantly stronger recovery than in haloperidol."</seg>
<seg id="80">"in a placebo-controlled study of 26 weeks of stabilized patients with chronic schizophrenia, Aripiprazl showed a significantly higher return rate that was 34% in the Aripiprazole group and 57% below placebo."</seg>
<seg id="81">"in an Olanzapine-controlled, multi-blind study in schizophrenia over 26 weeks, the 314 patients included a weight gain of at least 7% compared to baseline (i.e. an increase of at least 5.6 kg with an average weight of approximately)."</seg>
<seg id="82">"in two placebo-controlled monotherapy studies with flexible dosage over 3 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed superior effectiveness versus placebo in reducing manic symptoms over 3 weeks."</seg>
<seg id="83">"in a placebo-controlled monotherapy study over 3 weeks with a fixed dose of patients with a manic or mixed episode of bipolar-I disorder, Aripiprazl showed no superior efficacy compared to placebo."</seg>
<seg id="84">"in two placebo and active controlled monotherapy studies over 12 weeks in patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar I disorder, with or without psychotic characteristics, Aripiprazl showed superior efficacy in week 3 and a preservation effect comparable to that of lithium or haloperidol in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in addition, Aripiprazole showed a comparable proportion of patients with symptomatic remission of the mania, such as lithium or haloperidol, in week 12."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in a placebo-controlled study of 6 weeks with patients with a manic or mixed episode of a bipolar-I-disorder, with or without psychotic features, which in some 2 weeks do not respond to lithium or valproat monotherapy with therapeutic serum levels, the adjuvant therapy with Aripiprazl revealed superior efficacy in reducing manic symptoms compared to monotherapy with lithium or valproat."</seg>

<seg id="94">"based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, reproductive toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential, preclinical data did not reveal any particular danger to humans."</seg>
<seg id="95">"toxicologically significant effects were only observed in dosages or expositions, which significantly exceeded the maximum dosage or exposure to humans, so they have limited or no importance for clinical application."</seg>
<seg id="96">The effects included a dose-dependent adrenal rinse toxicity (lipofuscin pigment accumulation and / or parenchymal loss) in rats after 104 weeks at 20 to 60 mg / kg / day (equivalent to the average maximum dose in humans) and an increase in secondary-kidney-state exposure (AUC) at the recommended maximum dose in humans).</seg>

<seg id="864">"Actrophane has been studied in 294 patients with type 1 diabetes, where the pancreas cannot produce insulin, and type 2 diabetes where the body is unable to use insulin effectively."</seg>
<seg id="865">"in the study, the concentration of a substance (glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was measured after 12 weeks, indicating how well the blood sugar is set."</seg>
<seg id="866">"Actrophane led to a decrease in the HbA1c mirror, indicating that the blood sugar levels were significantly reduced as with another human insulin."</seg>
<seg id="867">Actrophane should not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to insulin (rDNA) or any of the other components.</seg>
<seg id="868">"in addition, the doses of Actrophane may be adjusted if it is administered along with a number of other medicines that may affect blood sugar (the complete list is to be found in the package contents)."</seg>
<seg id="869">The Committee on Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) concluded that the benefits of Actrophane outweigh the risks in the treatment of diabetes.</seg>
<seg id="870">"in October 2002, the European Commission issued a permit to the company Novo Nordisk A / S for the transport of Actrophane in the entire European Union."</seg>
<seg id="871">Pre-mixed insulin products are normally applied once or twice daily when a quick initial effect is desired along with a longer lasting effect.</seg>
<seg id="872">The injection needle must be left under the skin for at least 6 seconds to ensure that the whole dose was injected.</seg>
<seg id="873">"for example, patients whose blood sugar adjustment has improved significantly by an intensive insulin therapy, can change the hypoglycemia warning symptoms and should be advised accordingly."</seg>
<seg id="874">"any change regarding strength, brand (manufacturer), insulin type (fast acting, biphasic, long-acting insulin, etc.), type of insulin (animal insulin, insulin insulin, insulin analog) and / or production method (by recombinant DNA towards insulin in animal origin) can cause a change in dosage."</seg>
<seg id="875">"if a dose-adjustment is necessary in the case of change to acetonium in the patient, it may be necessary at the first dosage or in the first weeks or months after the changeover."</seg>
<seg id="876">Some patients with hypoglycemic reactions after a change from animal to human insulin reported that the early warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia were less pronounced or different from their previous insulin.</seg>
<seg id="877">"when travelling over several time zones, the patient should be advised to take the advice of his doctor as such trips can cause insulin and meals to be applied or taken at other times."</seg>
<seg id="878">"therefore, the doctor must take into account the possible interactions with the therapy and his patients always ask for other medicines taken by them."</seg>
<seg id="879">4 Both hypoglycaemia as well as hyperglycaemia which can occur in a non-controlled diabetes therapy increase the risk of abnormalities and pulp in utero.</seg>

<seg id="886">"however, hypoglycaemia can develop gradually: • Light hypoglycaemia can be treated by the oral supply of glucose or sugary foods."</seg>
<seg id="887">"diabetics should therefore always have grape picking, sweets, biscuits or sugary fruit juice. • Serious hypoglycemias associated with unconsciousness are treated with an intra-muscular or subcutaneous injection of glucagon (0.5 to 1.0 mg) or by glucose which is given intravenously by the doctor."</seg>
<seg id="888">"the effect begins within half an hour, the maximum effect is reached within 2 to 8 hours and the whole active duration amounts to 24 hours."</seg>
<seg id="889">Resorption The resorption profile is based on the fact that the product is a mixture of insulin products with a rapid resp. delayed absorption.</seg>
<seg id="890">A number of Spalt (hydrolysis) places on human insulin molecules have been considered; none of the metabolites formed by the division is active.</seg>
<seg id="891">"based on conventional studies on safety pharmacology, toxicity in repeated administration, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential and reproductive toxicity, preclinical data cannot identify any particular danger to humans."</seg>

<seg id="1643">The virus in advexin is a "Adenovirus" that has been modified so that there are no copies of itself and thus cannot trigger infections in humans.</seg>
<seg id="1644">"Advexin could have been directly injected into the tumors, allowing cancer cells to reform the normal p53 protein."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"the p53 protein, which is made of the non-defective p53 gene in the human body, normally contributes to the recovery of damaged DNA and to kill the cells when the DNA cannot be recovered."</seg>

<seg id="1656">"for adults and adolescents age 12, the recommended dose of aerinaze is twice daily a tablet, which should be taken completely with a glass of water with or without food."</seg>
<seg id="1657">"the duration of the treatment should be as short as possible and terminated once the symptoms, especially the swelling of the nasal mucosa (clogged nose), are clung."</seg>
<seg id="1658">A treatment duration of more than 10 days is not recommended because the effects of the medicine can be reduced to the constipation of the nose.</seg>
<seg id="1659">The main activity measurements were the changes in severity of hay fever symptoms reported by the patients prior to treatment and during the 15-day treatment.</seg>
<seg id="1660">During the study patients carried out their symptoms every 12 hours in a diary and rated with a standard scale how difficult the symptoms were in the last 12 hours.</seg>
<seg id="1661">"considering all hay fever symptoms, except the constipation of the nose, patients who received aerinaze reported a decrease in symptoms by 46.0% compared to 35.9% in patients receiving pseudoephedrine alone."</seg>
<seg id="1662">"if only the swelling of the nasal mucosa was considered, the patients under aerinaze showed a relief of the symptoms by 37.4% compared to 26.7% in the patients receiving the loratadin alone."</seg>
<seg id="1663">"the most frequent side effects of aerinaze (observed in 1 to 10 out of 100 patients) are tachycardia (heart chasing), dizziness, dizziness, psychomotor hyperactivity (loss of appetite), constipation, headache, fatigue, insomnia (sleeplessness), sleep disorders and nervousness."</seg>
<seg id="1664">"aerinaze may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to disloratadin, pseudoephedrine or any of the other ingredients, against adrenergic agents or Loratadin (another medicine for the treatment of allergies)."</seg>

<seg id="1668">Aerinaze should not be used in children under the age of 12 due to the lack of data for safety and efficacy (see section 5.1).</seg>
<seg id="1669">The duration of the application is as short as possible and should not be continued after the symptoms fade away.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"it is recommended to limit the application time to 10 days, as long-term use can decrease the activity of pseudoephedrine with time."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"after the swelling of the mucous membranes in the upper respiratory tract, treatment may be continued as monotherapy if necessary."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"since Aerinaze contains pseudoephedrine, the medicine is also contraindicated in patients treated with a monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitor within 2 weeks of treatment."</seg>

<seg id="1979">"pharmacokinetic studies with amerase in combination with erythromycin have not been carried out, but both medicines could be increased in case of simultaneous administration."</seg>
<seg id="1980">The simultaneous use of twice daily 700 mg halonavir and 100 mg ketoconazole once daily led to an increase in the CMAx of ketoconazole in plasma by 25% and the AUC (0-Massage) to 2.69x compared to the value observed after 200 mg of ketoconazol once daily without simultaneous use of Fosamonavir with Ritonavir.</seg>
<seg id="1981">"other medicines listed below, including substrates, inhibitors, or inductors of CYP3A4 can, if used together with agroase, may lead to interactions."</seg>

<seg id="1989">"HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors such as Lovastatin and Simvastatin, whose metabolism is strongly dependent on CYP3A4, are to be expected with pronounced increases in plasma gas at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"as plasma levels of these HMG-CoA-reductase inhibitors can lead to myopathy, including a rhabdomyolysis, the combined use of these drugs with amonavir is not recommended."</seg>
<seg id="1991">"more frequent monitoring of the therapeutic concentrations to stabilization of the mirror is recommended, as the plasma concentrations of cyclosporin, rapamycin and tacrolimus can be increased at the same time as amonavir (see section 4.4)."</seg>
<seg id="1992">"therefore, astase should not be used together with orally captured midazolam (see section 4.3) while at the same time caution is advised with parenteral midazolam."</seg>
<seg id="1993">Data for the simultaneous use of parenteral Midazolam with other proteaseininhibitors indicate a possible increase in the plasma gas of Midazolam for 3 to 4 times.</seg>

<seg id="2807">Ammonia can also be used in patients aged over a month with incomprehensive enzyme defect or hyperammonia encephalopathy (brain damage due to high ammonia concentrations) in prehistory.</seg>
<seg id="2808">"ammonia is - divided into several individual doses to the meals - swallowed, mixed under the food or administered via a gastrostomia (through the abdominal wall into the stomach's leading hose) or a nasal probe (through the nose into the stomach of leading hose)."</seg>

<seg id="2813">"the use is indicated in all patients, in which a complete enzyme deficiency has already manifested in newborns (within the first 28 live days)."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"in patients with a late-manned form (incomplete enzyme defect, which manifests itself after the first months of life), there is an indication for use when hyperammonia encephalopathy is present in the anamnesis."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"for infants, for children who are unable to swallow tablets or for patients with difficulty swallowing, AMMONAPS is also available in granular form."</seg>
<seg id="2816">The daily dose is calculated individually with respect to protein intolerance and the daily protein intake needed for the patient's growth and development.</seg>
<seg id="2817">"according to previous clinical experience, the normal daily dose of sodium phenylbutyrat: • 450 - 600 mg / kg / day in children with a body weight of less than 20 kg • 9,9 - 13,0 g / m ² / day in children with a body weight over 20 kg as well as in adolescents and adults."</seg>
<seg id="2818">The substitution of citrulline or arginine in a dosage of 0.17 g / kg / day or 3.8 g / m ² / day is required for patients suffering from an early manifest lack of Carbamate phosphate synthetase or orniintranscarbamylase.</seg>
<seg id="2819">Patients with argininosuccinatsynthetase deficiency must obtain arginine in a dose of 0.4 - 0.7 g / kg / day or 8.8 - 15.4 g / m ² / day.</seg>
<seg id="2820">"AMMONAPS tablets may not be given to patients with difficulty swallowing, because there is a risk for the formation of esophagus ulcera if the tablets do not immediately get into the stomach."</seg>
<seg id="2821">"each tablet AMMONAPS contains 62 mg (2.7 mmol) sodium, corresponding to 2.5 g (108 mmol) sodium per 20 g of sodium phenylbutyrat, which corresponds to the maximum daily dose."</seg>
<seg id="2822">"therefore, AMMONAPS should be used only with caution in patients with congestive heart failure or severe renal insufficiency and with sodium retention and edema."</seg>
<seg id="2823">"since metabolism and excretion of sodium phenylbutyrat over the liver and kidneys is carried out, AMMONAPS should be used only with extreme caution in patients with liver or renal insufficiency."</seg>
<seg id="2824">The importance of these results in pregnant women is not known; the use of AMMONAPS during pregnancy is therefore contraindicated (see 4.3).</seg>
<seg id="2825">"in subcutaneous administration of phenylacetate to young rats in high doses (190 - 474 mg / kg), there was a slowdown of neuronal proliferation and increased loss of neurons."</seg>
<seg id="2826">There was also a delayed maturation of cerebral synapses and a reduced number of functioning nerve damage in the brain and therefore a disability of brain growth.</seg>
<seg id="2827">"it could not be ascertained whether phenylacetate is excreted in humans in breast milk, and for this reason the use of AMMONAPS is contraindicated during the lactation period (see 4.3)."</seg>
<seg id="2828">"in clinical trials with AMMONAPS, 56% of patients had at least one adverse event (AE) and 78% of these adverse events were assumed that they were not associated with AMMONAPS."</seg>

<seg id="2830">"an probable toxic reaction to AMMONAPS (450 mg / kg / day) was reported by a 18-year-old anorectic patient who developed metabolic Encephalopathy in conjunction with lactic tin, severe hypokalemia, tank topenia, peripheral neuropathy and pancreatitis."</seg>
<seg id="2831">A case of overdosage occurred in a 5-month-old toddler with an accidental single dose of 10 g (1370 mg / kg).</seg>
<seg id="2832">These symptoms coincide with the accumulation of phenylacetate which showed a dose-limiting neurotoxicity in intravenous doses of up to 400 mg / kg / day.</seg>
<seg id="2833">Phenylacetate is a metabolized active compound conjugated by acetylation with glutamine to phenylacetylglutamine which is excreted via the kidneys.</seg>
<seg id="2834">Phenylacetylglutamine (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess nitrogen.</seg>
<seg id="2835">5 patients suffering from the urea cycle can be assumed to be produced for each gram of sodium phenylene butyrat between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>
<seg id="2836">It is important that the diagnosis is made early and the treatment is immediately started to improve survival chances and clinical outcome.</seg>
<seg id="2837">The prognosis of the early manifest form of the disease with the occurrence of the first symptoms in newborns was almost always infaust and the disease itself led to death in the treatment with peritoneal dialysis and essential amino acids or with their nitrogen-free analogues within the first year of life.</seg>
<seg id="2838">"through hemodialysis, the utilization of alternative ways of nitrogen excretion (sodium phenylbutyrat, sodium benzoate and sodium phenylacetate), protein-reduced food and possibly substitution of essential amino acids, it was possible to increase the survival rate of newborns in postpartal (but within the first months of life) to 80%."</seg>
<seg id="2839">"in patients whose disease was diagnosed in the course of pregnancy and they were treated before the first appearance of hyperammonia encephalopathy, the survival rate was 100%, but even in those patients it was time for many mental disabilities or other neurological deficits."</seg>
<seg id="2840">"in patients with a late-manent form of the disease (including female patients with the heterozygous form of the Orniintranscarbamylase deficiency), which were recovered from hyperammonia encephalopathy and treated permanently with sodium phenylbutyrat and a protein-reduced diet, the survival rate was 98%."</seg>
<seg id="2841">Already existing neurological deficits are hardly reversible for treatment and in some patients a further deterioration of the neurological condition can occur.</seg>
<seg id="2842">"it is known that phenylbutyrat is oxidized to phenylacetate, which is conjugated in liver and kidneys with glutamine, whereby phenylacetylglutamine is produced."</seg>
<seg id="2843">"the concentrations of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites in plasma and urine were determined after the dose of an individual dose of 5 g sodium phenylbutyrat in sober healthy adults and in patients with disorders of the urea cycle, haemoglobin metabolism and recurrent doses of oral doses of up to 20 g / day (non-controlled trials)."</seg>
<seg id="2844">The behaviour of phenylbutyrat and its metabolites was also examined in cancer patients after the intravenous administration of sodium phenylbutyrat (up to 2 g / m ²) or phenylacetate.</seg>
<seg id="2845">"after an oral dose of 5 grams of sodium phenylbutyrat in tablet form, measurable plasma concentrations of phenylbutyrat were observed 15 minutes after the intake."</seg>

<seg id="2849">"according to the results of the Micronucleus test, sodium phenylbutyrat did not treat rats treated with toxic and non-toxic doses (examination 24 and 48 hours after oral administration of an individual dose of 878 to 2800 mg / kg)."</seg>

<seg id="2857">Phenylacetylglutamine (both compounds contain 2 nitrogen atoms); phenylacetylglutamine is therefore suitable as an alternative carrier for excretion of excess.</seg>
<seg id="2858">On the basis of studies on excretion of phenylacetylglutamine in patients with disorders of the urea cycle can be assumed that for each gram the sodium phenylene butyrat can be produced between 0.12 and 0.15 g phenylacetylglutamine.</seg>

<seg id="2884">"in the treatment of ACS, angiox - with or without the gift of GPI - was as effective in preventing new events (deaths, heart attacks or reascularization) after 30 days or a year as usual as conventional treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2885">"in patients undergoing a PCI, angiox in relation to all indicators was as effective as Heparin, except for severe bleeding, in which it was significantly more effective than Heparin."</seg>
<seg id="2886">"angiox may not be used in patients who may be hypersensitive (allergic) to bivalirudine, other Hirudine or any of the other ingredients."</seg>
<seg id="2887">"it may not be used in patients who recently had bleeding, as well as for people with high blood pressure or severe kidney problems or heart infection."</seg>

<seg id="2895">The recommended dose of angiox in patients with a PCI consists of an initial intravenous infusion of 0.75 mg / kg body weight and a subsequent intravenous infusion with a dose of 1.75 mg / kg body weight / h at least for the duration of the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="2896">The safety and efficacy of a certain type of Bolus-administration of angiox has not been investigated and is not recommended even if a short PCI operation is planned.</seg>
<seg id="2897">"if this value (ACT after 5 minutes) is shortened to less than 225 seconds, a second bolt of 0.3 mg / kg / body weight should be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"in order to reduce the occurrence of low ACT values, the reconstituted and diluted drugs should be carefully mixed before the application and the dose is quickly administered intravenously."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"as soon as the ACT value is more than 225 seconds, further monitoring is no longer required, provided that the 1.75 mg / kg infusion dose is given correctly."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in patients with moderate kidney function restriction (GFR 30-59 ml / min), which are subjected to a PCI (whether treated with bivaliddin versus ACS or not), a lower infusion rate of 1,4 mg / kg / h should be used."</seg>

<seg id="2906">Patients are carefully monitored during treatment with regard to symptoms and signs of bleeding especially if bivaliddin is administered in combination with another anticoagulant (see section 4.5).</seg>
<seg id="2907">"even if the majority of bleeding in arterial occlusal positions occur in patients with bivaliddin, patients who undergo a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) may occur throughout the treatment throughout all hemorrhages."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in patients who are taking warfarin and being treated with bivaliddin, a monitoring of the INR (International Regised Ratio) should be considered to ensure that the value after settling the treatment with bivaliddin is again reached the level before the treatment."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"based on the knowledge of the mode of action of anticoagulants (Heparin, Warfarin, Thrombolytics or thrombocyte aggregates), these substances can increase the risk of bleeding."</seg>

<seg id="2966">"Apidra is injected subcutaneous (under the skin) into the abdominal wall, thigh or upper arm or administered as a permanent infusion with an insulin pump."</seg>
<seg id="2967">Diabetes is a disease where the body does not produce enough insulin for regulating the glucose level (sugar) in the blood or the insulin cannot process effectively.</seg>
<seg id="2968">Insulin lulisin differs very marginally from human insulin and the change means that it works faster and has a shorter period of active insulin than a short-acting human insulin.</seg>
<seg id="2969">"Apidra was studied in combination with a long-acting insulin in patients with type 1 diabetes, in which the body cannot produce insulin, in two studies with a total of 1,549 adults and in a study involving 572 children aged between four and 17 years."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"in type 2 diabetes, in which the body cannot be effectively processed, Apidra has been studied in a study involving 878 adults."</seg>
