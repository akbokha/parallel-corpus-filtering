package &amp; package ; contains several modules for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; in spite of their small size they offer some additional functions and simplify the use of some functions by &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; by making them easier to use .
more information on the use of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; and the built @-@ in functions can be found in the manual for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
&quot; to load these modules in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to load , select settings add @-@ ons .... open the card card Tools and select the modules you want . &quot;
this is a list of standard setup modules from the k@@ de ; add@@ ons package . please note that possibly more modules are on your system if you have additional software installed .
&quot; you should install the k@@ de@@ base package , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; contains before you compile this package . &quot;
&quot; then you can view the page , the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to crash , or delete the list of crashes , if present . &quot;
the module Rec@@ ru@@ ction Filter ( also called folder filter ) is available in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu bar with extras filter . with the module you can filter &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; &apos;s current working directory in different ways .
&quot; to use DO@@ M tree view in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; to use , select Extras DO@@ M tree ... and open a new window with DO@@ M of the currently displayed website . as default , the display starts with the root note of the document , example : document@@ Element , all other no@@ des are elements of this root node . &quot;
the Module &amp; FS@@ View ; for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; represents another view for objects with the MI@@ ME type in@@ ode / directory in local files . it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system .
the specific@@ ity of &amp; FS@@ View ; consists in representing ne@@ sted folder hierarch@@ ies by means of a so @-@ called Tree @-@ Map . tree @-@ Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in ne@@ sted structures . each object is represented by a rect@@ angle whose surface is proportional to its size . this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the subordin@@ ate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object .
&quot; at &amp; FS@@ View ; the size is the size of a file or folder , where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it . thus , large files can be easily recognized even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy . therefore , &amp; FS@@ View ; as a graphical and interactive version of the &amp; UNIX ; command you are considered . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; FS@@ View , an entry in the Tre@@ em@@ ap is a rect@@ angle that represents a file or folder in your fil@@ esystem . &quot;
&quot; the color of a rect@@ angle , which is switched over view color mode , can either represent depth for the easy detection of the ne@@ sting depth or the image of another file property such as name , owner , group or MI@@ ME type . &quot;
&quot; a rect@@ angle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder . for each feature , you can specify whether or not it is displayed at all , only if there is sufficient space for representation or whether the area should be used by the character of the tre@@ em@@ ap . furthermore , you can specify the relative position of the cap@@ tion in the rect@@ angle . &quot;
&quot; for Tre@@ em@@ ap in the Tre@@ em@@ ap in &amp; FS@@ View , this goal is not always maintained . frames are drawn to represent the ne@@ sting of entries , and this frame will need room , which will then no longer be available to subordin@@ ate entries . note that less space for the frame is lost when square is square . &quot;
&quot; how spl@@ itting the area of an entry for the subordin@@ ate entries is left to the implementation . here , it is possible to divide the areas in such a way for the lab@@ eling and avoid@@ ance of space losses through frames , that rec@@ tan@@ gles are created which are as square as possible . the best methods concerning this are rows , columns or recur@@ sive division . &quot;
&quot; you can set the minim@@ ally displayed area for an entry on the menu entry view on area . instead , a space pattern is drawn in the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordin@@ ate entry . &quot;
&quot; originally , the FS@@ View was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the Tre@@ e@@ Map wid@@ get developed for K@@ C@@ ach@@ eg@@ r@@ ind application . &quot;
the Picture Gallery module can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras Image Gallery ... or with C@@ trl ; I .
&quot; when you visit the Picture Gallery module , a dialog opens , which allows you to specify the appearance of the gallery . &quot;
the title of the page allows you to adjust the title of the picture gallery page in a text input field .
the option images per line has a slider and a turning field to set the number of thumb@@ nails of each line in the gallery .
&quot; by displaying the fil@@ en@@ ame of the image , see if the file names under the thumb@@ nails are shown in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; to view the file size of the image , see if the file size under the thumb@@ nails is shown in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; with the image size check box , you specify whether the size of the images is displayed under the thumb@@ nails in the gallery . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog folder , specify where the gallery is stored and which sub@@ folders are to be included . &quot;
&quot; in the file choos@@ er Save to HTML file , specify where the HTML page should be saved . &quot;
&quot; using the check box sub@@ folder , you can set the sub@@ folder with a slider or a rotation panel , up to which level the sub@@ folders are included . &quot;
&quot; with the check box , copy the original pictures to see if the original pictures are to be copied to the gallery . &quot;
use the check box Com@@ mentary File to use a comment file for cap@@ tion of images in the gallery .
&quot; in the check box O@@ wn color depth , you can set a different color depth than in the original pictures for the thumb@@ nails . &quot;
the module &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings provides easy access to general &amp; HTML ; -@@ settings for &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; .
the module &amp; HTML ; settings can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under Extras HTML settings . the following behavior of the navig@@ ator can be specified here :
&quot; the media playback for the navigation pane can be found in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; menu under the navigation pane , or with the short@@ cut F@@ 9 . &quot;
&quot; to play , click on the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or navigation area ; and drag the music files you want to listen to in the media playback . &quot;
&quot; change browser identi@@ fier adds a menu entry in the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , where you can change browser and operating system recognition for individual domains . this is helpful for websites that allow access only with certain browsers . &quot;
&quot; the default browser recognition of the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; is Mozilla / 5.0 ( compatible ; Kon@@ quer@@ or / 3.3 ; Linux ) ( K@@ HTML , like G@@ eck@@ o ) . if you are accessing a website that refuses to access this browser , change browser recognition in one of the following options . &quot;
&quot; change the passwords in M@@ SI@@ E for pages that reject access with browsers based on Mozilla . for example , you need the M@@ SI@@ E browser detection to invoke with the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; Hot@@ mail . &quot;
pages that do not conform to the W3@@ C standard or use their own &amp; HTML ; - elements and attributes are correctly displayed using this outdated browser .
&quot; with this option , the browser identi@@ fier is used for all pages of the site you are currently viewing . &quot;
with the menu entry ... you can set the amount of information about the browser used and the operating system in the individual .
with this &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ module you check your &amp; CSS ; -@@ Style templates and &amp; HTML ; -@@ Documents in accordance with the recommendations of the W3@@ C and other standards .

&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; contains a fast image processing with basic image editing tools . you can use them to view , comment , evaluate and correct your photos . the editing capabilities can be easily expanded with K@@ DE image plug @-@ ins interface ( manual ) modules . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; digi@@ cam ; easy to use , it provides dozens of professional skills . it works completely in 16 bit color space and all available modules support the shell conversion by li@@ bra@@ w , D@@ NG export and ICC colour management workflow . &quot;
&quot; improved database with considerably more metadata , such as the camera or the lens , which can be searched . &quot;
&quot; like all &amp; k@@ de ; programs are also &amp; digi@@ code ; an open source project . that means , it depends on the support of the end users . therefore , you should report problems and opportunities for improvement . &quot;
&quot; if you are using this link , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . if you are using this link , your web browser will open a page in the error report system . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a project supported by a community . that is , the user and developer will help each other . if you are a regular user of &amp; digi@@ kam , then we would like to encourage you to answer questions of other users . in this mailing list , however , English is spoken , you should therefore be powerful in this language . &quot;
you can also visit the digi@@ code ; homepage to see news about shared versions and other information about &amp; digi@@ cam ; to learn .
the best start to participate is logging in the developer mailing list . instructions for logging in the developer mailing list by &amp; digi@@ kam .
&quot; you can specify a local , remote or remote folder . simply enter the path name or click the folder icon folder icon to select a folder . &quot;
&quot; in the second field , you must specify a local folder on your computer . here , the data storage is stored . this path remains the same for all image folders . &quot;
&quot; later , you can add as many folders as you want . &amp; digi@@ cam ; will also use you as the Al@@ ben@@ bibliothek . settings digi@@ K@@ am set up collections &quot;
&quot; if you already have a picture collection on your hard disk , you can specify the top folder that contains images , as base folder . &amp; digi@@ cam ; view each sub@@ folder as an album . no image is changed . while browsing the folder , you get a progress indicator like this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; search recur@@ sively the library path in its full depth . you cannot exclude sub@@ folders , unless it &apos;s i@@ ste in hidden folder . this allows you to insert a dot in front of the name of the sub@@ folder . &quot;
&quot; if you take an existing folder with photos as base folder , you will notice that the albums in My Al@@ ben@@ List have no photos as symbols . &quot;
&quot; once you have configured the base folder , you can set up in &amp; digi@@ cam ; set up your digital camera . after that you should learn how to use My Albums and My Seri@@ al i@@ ste to manage your photos in the albums . &quot;
&quot; the support is based on the li@@ bra@@ w library . if you want to find out if a special camera is supported , you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help Roh@@ Camera Support menu . &quot;
how to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Ro@@ h Dec@@ oder@@ Settings and Ro@@ h workflow .
&quot; an easy @-@ to @-@ use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in &amp; digi@@ cam ; albums . more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the g@@ photo@@ 2 library . of course , any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with &amp; digi@@ cam . &quot;
modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact &amp; Flash ; Memory Cards and USB or Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) for data transfer . the camera is then used as a disk drive . the connection can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol ( P@@ TP ) and its deri@@ vatives . older cameras may use the serial port ( RS @-@ 232 ) .
&quot; photo@@ 2 is a free , distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras . g@@ Photo@@ 2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol , a widely distributed protocol that was developed by the International Imaging Industry Association . it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers . &quot;
many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer . since photos in general are large files and transm@@ issions via the serial port are slow this connection is now obsol@@ ete . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with g@@ Photo@@ 2 . a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link .
&quot; lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 must have been created with li@@ be@@ x@@ if support to read the preview images from digi@@ K@@ am . if the Ex@@ if support is not available in lib@@ g@@ photo@@ 2 , you might not be able to view thumb@@ nails or the creation could be very slow . &quot;
one of the most beautiful things at &amp; digi@@ kam ; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules :
K@@ IP@@ I modules : the K@@ DE image plug @-@ ins Interface Project ( manual ) is an approach to develop a common module structure for &amp; digi@@ kam . the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs . the settings for the K@@ IP@@ I modules are described in this section .
&quot; modules can manipul@@ ate images in virtually any way , as a user can . their advantage is that it is much simpler , &amp; digi@@ code ; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in &amp; edited ; itself perform . &quot;
&quot; to simplify the window , you can either remove the page bars with &amp; L@@ MB ; or change to full@@ screen mode with F@@ 11 or C@@ trl + Shift + F . &quot;
&quot; drag and drop images will work everywhere : you can place an image in another part of the Al@@ ben@@ ign tree , above the horizontal separ@@ ator line or into another application window . the only limitation is that an image is not to drop in keywords , date list or search . &quot;
&quot; a file type selection allows you to extract the most common : JPEG , P@@ NG , TI@@ FF , Ro@@ h , movies and audio &quot;
&quot; the text filter is used only for the fields displayed in the tool@@ bar . this way , the filter works on the file name only if it is displayed in the tool@@ view . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; places an organized view on your photo albums . all the photos that were edited by &amp; digi@@ kam are stored in a single album tree . these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive , after the name of their collection in the al@@ en@@ ames or after the date on which the album was created first . the date can be changed in the properties of the album . &quot;
&quot; if you have created a scanner , you can also scan a photo directly into an album . you can also scan a screen@@ shot directly to an album . &quot;
&quot; to copy or move an image from one album to another , you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it . in the pop @-@ up menu you will need to select or copy several photos . simply select all the photos and move them to the target album . &quot;
&quot; an album contains a collection of photos and the album features allow you to enter information about this collection . to access the album features , right click on the album and select album properties in the context menu . &quot;
&quot; album collections : are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name . the collection you use will be used to sort your photos , if you want to add or delete new collections , you can make this in the collections for collections . &quot;
the Alb@@ um@@ - Date : is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums sorted by date .
&quot; the buttons el@@ dest , average , new test@@ ers : they set the date on that of the oldest , the newest picture or that of the average of the album . to do this , first try to calculate the average of the images from their EX@@ IF information . if this fails , the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder . &quot;
&quot; when you first have an album in &amp; digi@@ kam , the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the &amp; quot ; My Al@@ ben@@ li@@ ste@@ quot ; this will help you to remember the photos in the album . sometimes , the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , click the picture with the right mouse button and select &quot; &quot; As an album preview &quot; . &quot; in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
an album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be ne@@ sted .
album collections have a different effect . you can of course use both methods to organize your photos .
&quot; the image window provides you with the main view of your photos . if you select an album , all pictures in this album will be displayed in the image window . each photo is displayed in a preview , you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magni@@ fying buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; when you open an album for the first time , you need to wait short while the thumb@@ nails are generated . this can be avoided by using the Extras All thumb@@ nails in the Tools menu . &quot;
&quot; information about each image is displayed below the associated preview . what information this is , you can edit via settings ; set up the albums page and adjust the area preview images to your wishes . &quot;
the thumb@@ nails feature help window that appears . if you leave the mouse cursor over an image for a moment . the help displays the most important features including all the keywords of a photo . the screen@@ shot above in the introduction to the main window shows such a help window .
&quot; pictures are all that was digi@@ ti@@ zed ; albums and keywords allow you to organize your pictures in such a way as it fits you . image editing shows your photos and allows you to achieve a number of improvements to these . you can choose between viewing images , slides or editing the pictures . &quot;
&quot; you can open the image editing with a photo by selecting either F@@ 4 Image Edit ... or selecting the contex@@ tual menu of the image with the right mouse button and editing ... in the editing section , you will find a guide how to edit your photos . &quot;
&quot; you can open a photo in another program by opening the context menu with the right mouse button and selecting the program from the sub@@ menu of opening . for this , and how to adjust it to your needs , if your program is not listed , you will find information in the &amp; k@@ de ; manual . &quot;
&quot; you should note that after editing , other image processing programs may cause problems with the metadata contained in the image . some programs do not save these data when you save the modified image . this means that this information is lost from the EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data , such as orientation , aperture , etc . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides two options for rotation . the easiest way is to click the right mouse button on the preview and select the rotate . in the sub@@ menu you can specify the degree of rotation .
&quot; to change the fil@@ en@@ ame of a photo , right click on the preview and select F@@ 2 ren@@ ame from the context menu . note that you keep the extension ( .@@ j@@ pg , .@@ tif , &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete a photo , delete it , it will be moved into the garbage b@@ ins of &amp; k@@ de ; Del@@ ete F@@ 8 Photo Del@@ ete or Del if you prefer to really delete , you can use this by using Shift ; Del . &quot;
&quot; view &amp; quot ; My Dat@@ um@@ sli@@ me quot ; organize your photos on the basis of the data . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses either the EX@@ IF date or , if this is not available , the date of last modification of the file . &quot;
&quot; if you select a month from the list , all photos of this month will be shown in the picture view . you can select days or weeks in the date sheet below in the date view , so that only the photos of the selected days will be shown . &quot;
&quot; keywords are sti@@ ckers , which can be assigned to individual photos or entire groups . as soon as a keyword has been assigned to a photo , the photo can be found by selecting this keyword or search . &quot;
&quot; if a keyword is selected , all the photos that have been marked with this keyword will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; keywords can be sorted in a hierarch@@ ical tree . by doing this , you can lo@@ gically organize your tags . you can also fold parts of the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword li@@ b ; fold , so that you can easily find the tags you are looking for . &quot;
&quot; the keywords are stored in a database for quick access and assigned keyword in the IP@@ TC data fields of the image , at least for JPEG . you can also use your tags in other programs as well . &quot;
&quot; you can add new keywords by right @-@ clicking either &amp; quot ; My keyword &apos; ; or click on an existing keyword , and then select New keyword . if you have cli@@ cked a new keyword after clicking on an existing keyword , this will become the subject of this keyword . &quot;
&quot; if you delete a keyword , the photo itself will not be deleted . only the keyword will be removed from this photo . &quot;
&quot; you can change the position of a keyword by pulling it to the desired position in the tree and drop it there . then a menu appears , which gives you the possibility to move the keyword to move . a keyword can be at a time only once in the tree . &quot;
you can change the properties of a keyword by clicking it with the right mouse button and selecting the keyword in the context menu . you can change the name of the keyword and the symbol in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword .
&quot; to select another photo as an album symbol , you must click the picture with the right mouse button and select the album preview as an album preview . in addition , you can drag the photo to the album in the list to set it as a symbol . &quot;
&quot; this can be done in two ways : as soon as you have chosen the photos that you want to add with a keyword , you can click on the corresponding keyword in the tree &amp; quot ; My keyword &apos; ; alternatively , you can also use the right mouse button to select the thumb@@ nails and select from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; you can tag a photo with any number of keywords . the photo will be displayed as soon as you select one of the keywords assigned to it . in this way , you can assign a keyword for each person on a photo , one for the place where the photo was taken , one for the event where it was made , etc . &quot;
&quot; once you have provided a photo with keywords , this will be displayed in the main window under the preview of the image . &quot;
&quot; you can remove a keyword , in which you can use the right mouse button to open the context menu of the photo and select from the Tags menu Rem@@ ove . the menu shows you only the keywords that were assigned to the photo . &quot;
&quot; the time beam view displays a time @-@ dependent adjusting hist@@ ogram of the number of images per time unit . a selection frame can be moved through this hist@@ ogram . in order to select a time frame , you only have to click on the lower rect@@ angle of the selection frame , which displays the time unit . thus , all associated images are displayed in the main window . &quot;
in the box below you can enter a title and save your selection . this will appear in the list below .
&quot; includes all elements of the database : names , ratings , keywords , keywords , albums , collections , date stamps and more . &quot;
&quot; Neb@@ at er Such@@ box is a small lamp that becomes green when the search results hit . if you click here , the filtering will be deleted and all pictures are displayed again . if the search has found nothing , then the lamp becomes red . &quot;
&quot; the more advanced search tool is hidden in the tab in the left side bar with the bin@@ o@@ cul@@ ars . if you open this , you will get a simple search box as described above . you can save this search here as a live search , which always filters what you have entered as a search criterion . &quot;
&quot; when you are satisfied with your selection , press OK and search will be done . the results will be displayed in My search list in the main window . if you want to change your selection after searching , you only have to select the corresponding entry from the View list and select an option in its context menu . &quot;
&quot; if you choose to edit as an extended search , the dialog box appears for the extended search to change your previous search . more information can be found in the section The Tool for Advanced Search . &quot;
&quot; if you want to delete an existing search from the list , select Del@@ ete Search in the contex@@ tual menu . &quot;
&quot; the Advanced search provides you with an extended search form with many search parameters , which you can search in certain fields of &amp; digi@@ kam ; s database . &quot;
&quot; the list of search rules is used to set the options for a search query in the Al@@ ben@@ Database . each option can be added or deleted by operators . each option can be added to this list with search group / added or deleted from it . each option can be linked to others via the logical operations all ... , One ... , No ... or At least ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ code ; character@@ izes any image by a long number with a special technique , the hair algorithm . this allows to compare images by comparing these signatures . the smaller the difference between two image signatures , the more they correspond . this technique is applied in three areas . &quot;
&quot; similar entries : this is an area where you can drop any picture to find a similar one . by means of a sw@@ ell@@ ar , the result selection can be enlarged or reduced . if you slide a picture from somewhere over the symbol of the in@@ exact search in the left side bar , then it will open and you can drop it there . &quot;
sket@@ ch : free hand color sket@@ ch : draw a quick sket@@ ch and &amp; digi@@ cam ; find the matching pictures . also here a threshold value can be set .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it down and move it . move it while you press the left mouse button . click C@@ trl ; left mouse button to open a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses your images ge@@ o @-@ data .
&quot; in the field below , you can specify a name for your ge@@ o filter . this will be added for later use of the list below . it works like a live ge@@ o folder . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; provides a lumin@@ aire in a separate window that allows you to easily compare images . it works with all supported image file formats , including raw files . &quot;
&quot; select one or more images from any view in the main window , and then use C@@ trl ; L D@@ em Fluor@@ escent Add from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; from the preview strip , you can drag the images you want to compare in the left or right area of the window and place them there . a small arrow indicates which copy in which window area is to be seen . &quot;
&quot; if you use pairs of pairs navigate from the tool@@ bar , then the two first images are automatically loaded into the area to compare it . now , use the left mouse button on any thumb@@ nail to see it in the right pane . this makes it easy to work through a number of similar images . &quot;
&quot; of course , the normal dele@@ tion actions also work directly from the lumin@@ aire like e.g. F@@ 4 file editing .... &quot;
all image information from the right side bar of the main window is available for both preview images in the lumin@@ aire . this makes it simple to link visual differences with exposure data .
&quot; at the bottom of each area you will find a built @-@ in swi@@ vel function that you can see on the crossed arrows . in order to swi@@ vel the visible area of the picture , you need to click it and hold the &amp; L@@ MB ; in the mode preview , both pictures will show the same image area . &quot;
zoom in the image or C@@ trl ; mouse wheel to zoom in and out of the image . this happens in both images if you are previ@@ ewing in the Pre@@ view mode .
&quot; digital inventory management considers each part of the process that follows after the image has been taken up to final output and permanent storage . each of us takes photos , scans or stores digital photos performs a form of digital inventory management . however , most of us do not do this in a systematic and efficient way . &quot;
&quot; we give you a tool , a plan and practical tips on how to back up your pictures , find , protect and use photos again . we consider downloading , ren@@ aming , removing , converting , group@@ ing , securing , evaluating , group@@ ing , archiving , waiting and ex@@ porting image files . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Digital inventory management records , inde@@ xes , categ@@ ori@@ zes , sec@@ ures , searches , transforms , fabri@@ c@@ ates and exports content that has a monetary or cultural value a.@@ quot ; &quot;
metadata is defined as data about data . metadata is stored in accordance with your definition data that provides information about or a documentation of other data administered by an application or environment .
&quot; if you don &apos;t even know how many photos you have , then do not use it &amp; digi@@ code ; . the approach to save the metadata in a database as well as in the image files guarantees very fast search and secure archiving to which you can freely access other programs , platforms and formats . &quot;
&quot; the first thing you need to do and know before you install anything in your system is the structure of information structure in contrast to the data structure . your image files must somehow be organized on your computer , whether you want to save them to a reserved drive or on a network drive , etc . &quot;
&quot; if you have enough photos , you will be able to organize sub@@ folders such as &amp; eg ; 2008 @-@ 01 , 2008 @-@ 02 &amp; etc . export is then a folder for images you print or publish on a website . &quot;
&quot; professional photographers have other requirements , such as version@@ ing photos , archiving , workflow , constant supply of images to different topics and a large number of all . within 10 years , 95 % of archives and 5 % of working files will have and you will not want to re@@ organize your structure for this content . &quot;
what types of files fit together ? separating file types makes the batch processing easier . dis@@ connect old files .
the separation of original and working files simpli@@ fies backup strategy and migration . you will always know if you are looking for an original or a deri@@ v@@ ative picture .
&quot; we also recommend saving the metadata option in the file &apos;s settings page . this ensures that EX@@ IF and IP@@ TC data are written into the file . if you forget this , then you can subsequently save the metadata from the database in the files by selecting the appropriate item from the Album menu . &quot;
&quot; now you have a lot of information in your database , but what if you want to change what if you want to change ? it provides a metadata editor for a number of selected attributes . these are of course the most important . &quot;
&quot; now the real work begins , as you should now assign keywords , cap@@ tions and an evaluation to each photo . of course , you can select all the images that need the same attribute and then set the value . this makes sense because you can focus on the best photos in the further work . &quot;
&quot; now let &apos;s go with keywords , keywords , as you often call other programs , or continue categories . all three are syn@@ ony@@ ms for the same thing . &quot;
&quot; when you import kat@@ alog@@ ised images from another source with embedded keywords , then &amp; digi@@ kam ; automatically build the tree for you or place the images in the right place . the change sorting of the hierarchy within the tree is no problem and can be easily done by dra@@ gging a sub@@ tree to another . &quot;
&quot; the graphic shows how different met@@ a @-@ data inter@@ s@@ ect . this is a very rough representation , since every block of metadata is in truth from many sections . fil@@ en@@ ames and calendar data are properties of all the images . &quot;
&quot; enough of the keywords - the next section refers to cap@@ tions or comments , the third important tool to catalog your metadata . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t want to let anyone know your photos simply , you want to share them with your friends , family , other photographers and agencies . &quot;
&quot; take a look at this panorama . from the distance is not even a beautiful beach panorama . if you look at it closer , then you start to see some details , people , the place . &quot;
&quot; and now I tell you that this is the landing place of the Al@@ lies &amp; quot ; O@@ ma@@ ha Be@@ ach@@ quot ; in the French Nor@@ mand@@ y 60 years after landing . wow ! you start to dream , have associations , memories , the historical period of time is present again , you may even hear the silence . &quot;
&quot; for others who look at your photos , the title may be more important than the image itself to create an interest . if you show pictures , you should tell a story . remember , the key is to transmit the importance to the viewer to help him about the subject that moves you to understand what you understand . &quot;
it is fine if a picture is not perfect if it has the strength only to work with a lab@@ eling for itself alone .
&quot; you can set it for a selection of pictures at the same time . if you export your images to web galleries , then these cap@@ tions are exported to the cap@@ tion and / or title of the web gallery system . so you don &apos;t have to tell the story a second time . &quot;
&quot; remember the times before GPS ? when you had to find a different city without a navigation system ? was it not a boring planet from Goo@@ gle@@ Earth ? well , because with pictures the train of the spatial presentation already drives with speed of light . &quot;
&quot; the possibilities to exploit the ge@@ olo@@ cation are countless and will become even deeper in the future . I am sure that one day , in the near future , you can virtually repeat your travels by images with geographic information . &quot;
&quot; &amp; quot ; Cop@@ y@@ left is a pu@@ n with copyright and design@@ ates the practice to use copy@@ rights to remove restrictions on the distribution and change of copies . the same freedoms also apply in all changed versions , so also for the works of others . &quot;
the following description tells you what information in the setup page of &amp; digi@@ kam ; as information should be deposited as information :
&quot; author ( syn@@ onym for creator and author ) : this field should contain your name , or the name of the person who created the photo , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s name , e.g. to protect the photographer &apos;s identity . &quot;
&quot; this field contains the name of the photographer . examples can be titles such as : hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent commercial photographer . since this is a note to the author &apos;s field , it must be completed as well . &quot;
&quot; if the photographer is working for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then these organizations can be listed here , which you offer the picture to others . if the picture is a bearing photo , then here the group / agency that offers the picture here . &quot;
&quot; it is very important to fill the author and copyright sections , even though they do not provide protection against abuse . anyone who has a little more than basic knowledge in working with calcul@@ ator can delete or change this in the image . for private persons , this is very important for the majority of your photos . for professionals and semi @-@ professionals this protection is very important . &quot;
the digital water@@ mark is unique per picture . &amp; digi@@ code ; will provide such a module for batch processing in the near future .
&quot; topics : panel errors , disk failure , power violations , EC@@ C , transmission errors , aging of storage media , restoration , redund@@ ancy , des@@ ast@@ ral prevention , life time , temperature , data size , spread super@@ sti@@ tion &quot;
&quot; of course , we don &apos;t talk about CDs that were lost on the street or a fire . these kinds of losses are the same that can happen to you in traditional paper photos or neg@@ atives . in this section , problems are about the so @-@ called New Media . &quot;
&quot; roll on@@ Track , the world &apos;s largest data recovery company , has some interesting statistics which causes data loss . &quot;
&quot; of course you can also buy CDs and DVDs in archive quality which are longer , more difficult to get and much more expensive . there are offers of gold @-@ coated DVDs , &amp; dollars ; 2 the piece which claim a lifetime of 100 years . whether you believe it is in your discretion . &quot;
&quot; CD / DVD discs can be un@@ readable , but you can reduce this risk in which you use good disks and good recording devices and store them in the right way . so , the best DVD recording devices are not much more expensive than the cheapest but you write much more reliable . &quot;
&quot; 75 % of the data is only effective data , the rest we need for format@@ ting and control sum . despite this massive protection they are used by chemical aging , ultra@@ violet light , scrat@@ ches , dust &amp; etc . &quot;
&quot; for defective CDs and DVDs , there &apos;s a convenient program called I@@ so@@ Bu@@ ster that seems to work miracles on CDs and DVDs . it runs under Windows and &amp; Linux ; however , it is not yet available for Mac@@ s . there are also similar applications to read corrupted data from damaged disks , hard drives , flash drives , USB drives , etc . &quot;
&quot; optical media : Blu @-@ ray discs seem to capture the format war against the HD DVD . a dual layer Blu @-@ ray disc can store 50 GB and thus almost six times the capacity of a dual layer DVD with 8.5 GB . all that was said to CDs and DVDs , of course also applies to the Blu @-@ ray disk . &quot;
&quot; burn slowly with a good recorder on high @-@ quality media in a non @-@ propri@@ ated format . afterwards , you should read the media with a description , date &amp; author and then store it on a clean , dark @-@ dry and protected spot . don &apos;t forget to copy the data to the next generation of media before you can read the latest piece of hardware or software that can read this media . &quot;
&quot; your manufacturer &apos;s guarantees include a new disk , but not the data . Google provides a large field study on the error mechanisms of hard drives on this topic : Disk@@ bug Study &quot;
&quot; in short : disks hold the longest when you run at temperatures ranging from 35 ° C to 45 ° C. In case of lower anne@@ aling , the error rate increases dramatically . electronic parts of the controller are the most common cause of failure . &quot;
&quot; this is only the complete loss due to over@@ voltage . of course , you can also lose data loss due to a power failure before you have backed up the files , but these losses can usually be recovered without any major problems . &quot;
&quot; while most electric devices do not make a lot of electric sho@@ cks , this can cause serious damage to devices with computer chips and high speed processors . these can cause serious damage to your computer . thus , you can protect yourself from the inevitable that leads to a loss of time and money . &quot;
&quot; the most widespread protection against peaks is an over@@ voltage protection . this is a device that absorbed a part of the energy heat and gro@@ unded the rest . it is usually available in the form of a plug @-@ in bar , but remember that not every connector strip also contains an over@@ voltage protection . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for an over@@ voltage protection , you should ensure that it meets the UL 14@@ 49 standard . this guarantees a certain minimum of protection . &quot;
&quot; since an over@@ voltage of each cable can be used to your computer , you should ensure that all peripheral devices connected to your system are protected . some manufacturers also provide over@@ voltage sources that also contain a telephone connection for your modem . others provide connection options for the co@@ axial cable of the cable modem and the TV card . &quot;
&quot; if you have a not@@ ebook , then you will need a portable over@@ voltage protection . a variety of these devices are specially developed for not@@ ebooks and therefore very small and they also contain protection for the modem . thus , you are ideal for on the go . &quot;
&quot; while over@@ voltage protection protects your system from minor fluctuations in the power lines , it will not really help you in a complete failure . even a failure of just a few seconds can lead to the loss of irre@@ plac@@ eable data . &quot;
&quot; in addition to protection against over@@ voltage , these devices can automatically provide cordless energy when a power ou@@ tage occurs . this gives you the possibility to save your data and run down the system . some models allow them to continue to work until the current is running . furthermore , the life time of the battery and the accompanying software is interesting . &quot;
&quot; consider the potential risk to which your computer system is exposed and compare its security with the cost to avoid this . a high quality over@@ voltage protection can get you up to &amp; euro ; 20 . this is just a small price difference if you consider how well your computer is protected . at the end , you should always remember all cables before you go on holiday . &quot;
&quot; Amazon Web Service includes S3 - Simp@@ le Storage Service - a simple storage service . with the right configuration you can use it as a drive under &amp; Linux ; , Mac , and Windows . this allows you to use it as a backup destination for your software . Google shared storage is another popular offer that allows you to store any amount of data . &quot;
&quot; however , compared to the hard drives at home you are very expensive - 40 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 75 per year and 400 GB costs &amp; dollars ; 500 . in addition , you have to send the data via the comparatively slow internet . &quot;
&quot; the solutions are therefore only suitable as a solution against a local data loss of the most important images . this is not a bad solution , but it is not a general backup solution . &quot;
&quot; Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web ( Google ) , Fli@@ ck@@ r ( Yahoo ) and the photo community 23@@ h@@ q@@ .com provide online storage services that are fed on photos . your free memory is limited to 1 GB and you will not get your pictures in full resolution online . &quot;
&quot; from the point of view of data backup , the web solutions are very secure . transmission errors are automatically adjusted thanks to the TCP protocol and the large companies offer a backup and a distributed storage . thus , they are des@@ aster @-@ secure . &quot;
the diagram illustrates the elements of the transmission chain in the computer . all transm@@ issions are suscep@@ tible to transmission errors . the fil@@ esystem Z@@ FS and b@@ tr@@ fs ensure at least the data integrity between operating system and hard drive .
&quot; the worst thing about this is that nobody tells you when a transmission error occurred , not when this happened in your hardware . it is quite disturbing that there should be no protection in your computer . no one seems to have thought about it . the Internet with its TCP protocol is a much safer data path than that in your computer . &quot;
&quot; un@@ reliable power supplies are another source of transmission losses , as they generate inter@@ ferences within the data streams . in normal file systems , these errors remain un@@ noticed . &quot;
&quot; even if you are not particularly affected by transmission problems at the moment , you should look into the future . already in 2010 you will see thousands of bugs per year . &quot;
&quot; it is open source , with many patents and is available under a license for Solar@@ is and Leopard with a GP@@ L in@@ compatible license for Solar@@ is and Leopard . we can only hope that it will soon be available for &amp; Linux ; and Windows . read this article in English . &quot;
Oracle has launched its own initiative with its b@@ tr@@ fs fil@@ esystem . this is still in alpha state . it uses the same protection mechanisms that Z@@ FS uses and is also available for &amp; Linux ; but it is not yet part of the kernel .
do not under@@ estimate this ! these two factors are responsible for 86 % of data loss on not@@ ebook and 46 % for work@@ station systems .
&quot; data loss due to viruses is less common than most people think . it leads to less damage , such as theft or new installations . and it is currently restricted to Microsoft systems ; Apple users only know very few viruses and under &amp; Linux ; no one has been si@@ ghted for a long time . &quot;
&quot; open source file systems are less suscep@@ tible to data loss than proprietary systems : wrong , NT@@ FS is minimal better than ext@@ 3 , Reiser@@ FS , J@@ FS and X@@ FS to name the wi@@ dened file systems . &quot;
&quot; journ@@ aling fil@@ es@@ ystems prevent corrupted data and data loss : wrong , only the speed of the examination process during an operation is higher and an un@@ defined status is avoided . however , if a file was not completely saved before the problem came up , it is lost . &quot;
&quot; viruses are the biggest threat to digital data : wrong , theft and human errors are the main causes of data loss . &quot;
digital cameras are 1 @-@ 2 aperture settings from fundamental physical limits . it is meant that while the technology further develops there is a natural limit for this progress . sensitivity and noise characteristics for all types of light sensors are no longer far away from this limit .
today &apos;s cameras are moving towards the 10 meg@@ api@@ xel sensors . even if this resolution is too high for compact cameras and the final result rather deterior@@ ated . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit with 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els . even DS@@ LR cameras have your limit with 10 @-@ 12 meg@@ api@@ x@@ els .
&quot; you get a 7@@ 50@@ GB hard drive today for 100 &amp; euro ; so don &apos;t make anybody else for data loss . 6 % of all PCs are affected each year from a data loss . so back up your data after a plan and test this backup before you make any more dangerous such as re@@ installing your operating system , replacing disks or the res@@ izing of hard drives . &quot;
&quot; suppose you make every day your back@@ ups on an external SATA drive . if , then one day , a flash hit you are lucky if the drive was not connected at the moment . &quot;
&quot; a disaster strikes locally and destro@@ ys a lot . forget plane pieces : fire , water , electricity , children and thi@@ eves are dangerous for your data . they usually affect a whole room or the entire house . &quot;
&quot; so Des@@ ast@@ er@@ precau@@ tions always means a non @-@ local storage . bring your back@@ ups up the stairs , into the neighboring house , into your office or similar . &quot;
&quot; there is another advantage of physical separation : as said above , a common reason for a data loss despite backup is panic . if you have a backup that is not immediately available , then you can save that one day . &quot;
complete backup : a complete backup of all files to be secured . it is a snapshot without history and represents a complete copy at a time .
differential protection : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last complete backup . creates a complete snapshot at two times : that of the complete assurance and the latest differential protection .
incre@@ mental backup : a backup of the files that have been changed since the last backup . creates multiple snap@@ shots . you can restore the original status at any time on which such a backup has been made .
r@@ sync is a wonderful little tool that you can easily set up on your machines . unlike script @-@ controlled FTP sessions or other types of file transfers r@@ sync only copies the difference between files that have really been changed . this is compressed and if you want to increase security over s@@ sh .
save important images directly after you have saved them on your computer or on a DVD or other optical media .
&quot; at the end you have a complete daily version of the last 7 @-@ 14 days , a weekly snapshot for at least one month and a snapshot for each month . any further th@@ inning should be done manually , after which you have made a complete review . &quot;
&quot; themes : metadata in the image file saved IP@@ TC information , associated X@@ MP files , original retain , memory , scal@@ ability , media , retri@@ eving images and metadata , copying the images to the next generation of media , applications , operating systems , virtualization , viewing devices , ... , use of the Internet . &quot;
&quot; so that valuable pictures will survive the next 40 years , that is about the period in which you really are interested in you because they remind you of your childhood or youth , there are two strategies that should be considered : &quot;
&quot; since the future is un@@ predictable due to your nature , you have to look at all that is being said today with caution and re@@ assess while the time passes . unfortunately , there is no other way than a certain vi@@ gil@@ ance . each 5 @-@ 8 years you should ask yourself how the current system is backwards compatible . the less variants you used in the past , the easier it is to evaluate the questions of the future . &quot;
this question should actually be answered by explanations in this document . use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications .
virtualization is available for everyone nowadays . so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use .
&quot; on the other hand , the advice is quite simple : every time you change your computer architecture , memory and backup technology , or your file format , you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard . stay with open standards . &quot;
scal@@ ability is the specialist print for the possibility to change a system in its size . this actually means increasing .
let &apos;s assume that you have entered the scal@@ ability and the area you want to enlarge onto a dedicated disk or partition . with * ni@@ x systems like &amp; Linux ; you can copy this area and store it to a new record :
&quot; check with the command d@@ mes@@ g if your new record was recognized by the system , but do not app@@ end it . &quot;
&quot; / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c # source is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; the new disk is / dev / s@@ d@@ c@@ 1 0 &amp; lt ; size of the disk in MB@@ TRA ; # works with ext@@ 2,3 , F@@ AT@@ 16 , 32 and rei@@ ser@@ fs &amp; dollars ; res@@ iz@@ e@@ 2@@ fs / dev / s@@ d@@ c # change the size of the drive if necessary &quot;
&quot; open Source Standards have the great advantage of an open specification . even if there is no longer any software that can read it , you can create it yourself . this task will be easier from year to year . &quot;
&quot; GIF is a proprietary format which slowly disappears from the market , so you should not use it anymore . &quot;
&quot; P@@ NG was designed as an open source standard to replace GIF . it can however much more . it is los@@ s@@ less , supports X@@ MP , Ex@@ in@@ f and IP@@ TC metadata , 16 @-@ bit per color channel and full transparency . P@@ NG is able to use relative many administrative information , but not as many as TI@@ FF and have a slow compression . &quot;
TI@@ FF was widely used as image format . TI@@ FF can be stored in un@@ compressed form or in a container with a los@@ s@@ less compression algorithm ( Def@@ late ) . it manages images in high quality but requires very large files . with some cameras you can store your pictures in this format . there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types .
D@@ NG The digital Neg@@ ative file format is a license @-@ free and open source format that was developed by Adobe Systems . it is based on the TI@@ FF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata . a handful of camera manufacturers is now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon can also use it at some point .
&quot; this may be one of the reasons why , around 2001 , Adobe introduced its XML @-@ based X@@ MP technology to replace the &amp; quot ; Image resource block quot ; X@@ MP stands for &amp; quot ; Exten@@ sible Met@@ adata Plat@@ form@@ quot ; , a mixture of XML and R@@ DF . the file information is stored with the extension &amp; quot ; .x@@ mp@@ quot ; stored for XML / R@@ DF . &quot;
&quot; many photographers prefer to archive the original of your photo , mostly in the raw format . X@@ MP adapts to it since it stores the metadata separately from the image file . however , it can cause problems in connection between the metadata file and the image file . therefore , you should consider whether you use D@@ NG as a container and put everything together . &quot;
&quot; the Dublin Core Met@@ adata initiative is an open organization dedicated to fully compatible online metadata standards that support a wide range of applications and business models . D@@ C@@ MI &apos;s activities include work on architecture and modeling , annual conferences and workshops , standard meetings and educational efforts to achieve a wide acceptance of metadata standards and practices . &quot;
&quot; import images from the camera , the card reader or the scanner . as long as the images are on the camera edi@@ um , you can use this as a temporary backup . &quot;
convert raw files to D@@ NG and save them in your raw archive . this feature is not yet implemented .
&quot; you can use external programs for a fine processing . if you edit the images again with &amp; edited ; then you should add the metadata again . these were , under certain circumstances , cut off from the other programs . &quot;
&quot; protect the processed pictures for copyright with a digital water@@ mark . only export them to web galleries , enco@@ de in MPEG , use in contact sheets , print &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; the camera interface is not the only way to get your photos in &amp; edited ; in the addition of a photo to an album , you will find a description how you can add photos that you already have on your hard drive . however , the camera interface provides you many advanced settings to im@@ porting images to your Al@@ ben@@ Database . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , connect it to the computer , switch the camera to display mode and turn it on . another description will be found in the manual of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when you start the camera interface , it tries to connect to your camera . with some cameras it may take a while . if this is the case , a finished indicator appears at the bottom end and the thumb@@ nails of all photos on the camera will appear . if this is the case , the file names and a symbol for file assignments for each file , photos , movies , music , etc. will appear on the camera . &quot;
&quot; before downloading the photos on your computer , you might need to view the camera information for each entry . with the features and metadata from the camera interface you can see the properties of an entry or its metadata . &quot;
this dialog displays file properties and the photo information stored internally by the camera . a symbol indicates that the image has not yet been downloaded to your computer . note that with some digital cameras not all information is available .
&quot; the Ri@@ der metadata shows the internal metadata like Ex@@ if , manufacturer &apos;s notice , GPS , etc . this information is the same as the metadata aspect bar from the main window of &amp; digi@@ kam , or the image processing . note that this metadata is not available in some digital cameras . &quot;
the simplest way to download photos on your computer is the click on the Download button and then download the selection of All . this downloads the photos from your camera to a single album in &amp; digi@@ kam ; . downloading the photos will not be deleted and we recommend you to check if the photos are safely downloaded into an album before you delete the photos from the camera .
&quot; if you do not want to download all of the photos , you can only select the desired ones with the default selection methods by &amp; k@@ de . once you have selected the photos , use the Download button and then download the Sel@@ ected . the button Sel@@ ected is until you have selected some photos . &quot;
&quot; if your camera supports this , an option New download is available . in this case the new pictures are marked with a star in the preview window . if you choose this option , of course only the new pictures will be downloaded . &quot;
&quot; the list of existing albums is displayed , as usual folders are sorted , displayed . the list of existing albums is displayed as normal folder . you can then select the target album from the list and press OK . &quot;
&quot; after selecting the target album , press OK , and &amp; digi@@ cam ; upload the photos from the camera to the album . &quot;
&quot; once you have downloaded the desired photos , you can delete them from the camera . you can delete all of them at one time by using the Del@@ ete All button . if you just want to delete some , you must first select them and then delete the selected delete . &quot;
&quot; please note that there is no way to restore photos you deleted from the camera . so you should carefully check if the photos have been successfully deleted from the camera . so if you want to delete the camera completely , you should check it out of the camera because this is much faster . &quot;
&quot; cameras use as fil@@ en@@ ames for the photos frequently not particularly meaningful names . the fil@@ en@@ ames are normally re@@ used after the photos are deleted from the camera . this can lead to double fil@@ en@@ ames if you want to integrate photos of different recording galleries into the same album . therefore , it may be useful to integrate the date and time the picture has been taken into the file name . &quot;
&quot; in the next section you will find options for turning and mirr@@ oring the image and for file @-@ based sub @-@ albums . if you use this latter option , a folder per day will be created automatically . &quot;
&quot; the first two relate the data about the author in the standard car identity section . if you select this , the corresponding entries from the ex@@ if information will be copied to the IP@@ TC fields . with the last option you can correct date &amp; time for all downloaded images . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you want a different date format than the default format , you can use the Pre@@ fix fot@@ o- % Y@@ - % % % d % H : % M : % S . for further adjustments you should read the command str@@ f@@ time . &quot;
&quot; if you use the option camera file name , you will have the option of downloading the file names in lower@@ case . or in upper@@ case if you prefer . &quot;
&quot; the new fil@@ en@@ ame , which &amp; digi@@ code ; used for a photo , is displayed below the name that the camera provides in the preview . your settings for ren@@ aming are saved and used automatically when you next time you open the camera window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; can use all information about the orientation of the camera to the time point of recording to perform an automatic turn during downloading . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page bar Met@@ adata , you can read more details about the information that your camera has embedded in the photo . &quot;
&quot; the automatic turn is usually switched on , and if your camera does not provide this information , the photo is in the original orientation . if you want to turn off the automatic turn , use the Advanced button and select the Automatic Rotation in the bottom of the window . &quot;
&quot; when your camera provides information about the date the photo was made , it can be digi@@ ti@@ sed ; this sub @-@ albums are based on the image data . all images with the same date are loaded into the same sub @-@ album . not all cameras provide this information . in the section page bar Met@@ a data , you can read what information your camera could have embedded in the photos . &quot;
&quot; this option is usually switched off , and in this case it saves &amp; digi@@ code ; the photos directly in the target album . if you want to change this , you need to switch this option . use the Advanced Fol@@ der button and select the Date based sub @-@ bar option at the bottom of the window . &quot;
the easiest way to upload photos from their computer to their camera is the Download button . then select Up@@ load . the file selection dialog &amp; k@@ de ; appears where you can select the files that are to be uploaded . you can also select more than one file with the standard &amp; k@@ de ; methods .
&quot; after the image selection is done , ask &amp; digi@@ cam ; you where the images should be uploaded . a folder choos@@ er dialog for the camera appears . select the folder you want and press OK to start the upload . the images will not be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; GPS ( Global Posi@@ tioning System ) is used as a general term in this document . this means a position that is specified in length and width graphs and can be displayed on a map . determining the data can be performed by the American GPS , the Russian G@@ LO@@ NAS , the European GA@@ LI@@ LE@@ O or any other system . &quot;
&quot; not only for professional photographers it can be interesting to link a picture with a precise geographic location . not everyone uses an airplane to map an area by automatic recording of the GPS data . environmental planners , military , police , architecture offices and real estate agents can use this capability . &quot;
&quot; if you have forgotten later where exactly the photo was taken , you can open a browser that shows the area with a click . if you want to send a postcard to another , or simply want to document this aspect , it is good to save the position data of a photo . &quot;
&quot; the question is how do the GPS data come into the picture ? first , you should know that exi@@ v2 supports many GPS data fields , such as direction , saddle and card references . &quot;
&quot; as far as we know , there is currently no camera that has integrated a GPS unit . but there are a few who work with GPS receivers . either as card module or by transmission of the data with a cable or Bluetooth . &quot;
cameras with GPS interface : Co@@ y@@ ot@@ e@@ Eye i@@ PA@@ Q I@@ ke Ko@@ da@@ k D@@ CS Pro Nikon DS@@ LR Ri@@ co@@ h Pro G@@ 3 Sony
&quot; downloading the GPS data from one device can be done with g@@ ps@@ man or g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel . however , you need to save these data in GP@@ X format as this is the only format supported by the ge@@ o @-@ geographical module . &quot;
there are several programs for &amp; Windows ; and Mac OS that can extract and cor@@ relate data from images and GPS . on the following page you can make the same under &amp; Linux ; : g@@ ps@@ Cor@@ r or g@@ ps@@ Photo
&quot; if you know the long@@ itude and l@@ atitude or other data , then you can use this script that works with the Ex@@ i@@ f@@ tool by Phil Har@@ vey . it uses the esp@@ ac@@ ed coordinates created e.g. by map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle . &quot;
&quot; map@@ s.@@ goo@@ gle@@ .com does not show any European road maps . here are some European pages , at least in French , German and Spanish , which show all navigation details for Europe . &quot;
&quot; the Settings dialog is divided into eight pages . you can switch between these settings , by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
select action can be displayed on embedded preview or preview image editing . you specify the default behavior of &amp; digi@@ kam ; firm if you click on an entry in the main view .
&quot; this page contains , as shown below , the standardis@@ ation and copyright data . these data are automatically written into the corresponding IP@@ TC data fields when the option was selected when downloading from the camera interface . &quot;
&quot; this field should be the professional name of the photographer . this can be desig@@ nations such as hired photographer , freelance photographer or independent , commercial photographer . since this is a more detailed description of the author &apos;s field , this must also be filled . &quot;
&quot; publisher is a syn@@ onym for supplier : use this field to indicate the photo that the photo offers . this does not have to be the author , if this is for a news agency such as Reu@@ ters or Associ@@ ated Press , then the group or agency that provides the picture should be listed here . &quot;
the IP@@ TC actions store the data in the corresponding IP@@ TC ri@@ ms . this means that the metadata is permanently contained in the image and not only in the database of &amp; digi@@ kam ; . this metadata is also available to other programs and can be imported without lost .
&quot; save image lab@@ eling as embedded lab@@ eling ( J@@ FI@@ F ) in JPEG images : this synchron@@ izes the comments you add to your photos , using the cap@@ tions embedded in the pictures . &quot;
&quot; the Settings page contains all the options for the information that appear when the cursor is in the main window above a file . depending on the option selected , this information is displayed or not . &quot;
&quot; # 160 ; digi@@ cam ; supports a number of different image formats and some video and audio formats . to specify which file types &amp; digi@@ code ; attempt to display , you can add and remove the file extensions of this list . &quot;
default settings can be reset by pressing the Update button on the right of each category .
&quot; some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is then not available . however , some pictures have different sizes and the synchron@@ ous mode is not available . if you have one , then you can get better viewing results . &quot;
&quot; by default , image editing uses a black background behind the displayed photos . if you prefer a different color , you can select it here . you can turn off the tool@@ bar if you use the image editing in full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; over@@ - and under@@ exposed areas of an image can be marked with dark or light color in the image . these colors are set here . in image editing , this view mode can be switched on and off using F@@ 10 and F@@ 11 . &quot;
Chro@@ ma @-@ sub@@ sampling means that the images are enco@@ ded in a higher resolution of the lumin@@ ance than in the color information . please read this article in Wikipedia for a closer explanation .
&quot; with setting P@@ NG compression you can reduce the size of P@@ NG files . this operation does not reduce image quality because P@@ NG requires a los@@ s@@ less algorithm . if you have a fast computer , you can set this value to a high compression . &quot;
&quot; with the option TI@@ FF @-@ files comp@@ ress , you can switch the default compression algorithm for TI@@ FF images . this reduces the size of the TI@@ FF images . it has no effect on image quality since the default algorithm works los@@ s@@ less . &quot;
&quot; when you select the loss @-@ free JPEG 2000 files , you can save loss @-@ free . even if you select the los@@ sy setting , the relationship between quality loss and file size is far better than normal JPEG . when this paragraph was written , metadata was not yet supported , but was in the planning . &quot;
&quot; in previous versions of &amp; digi@@ kam , image editing was only a picture viewer for photos . at present , it quickly develops into a tool for manipul@@ ating your photos . with this dialog you can change the settings of image editing . &quot;
&quot; the standard assumption is that all green pixels are equal . if the linear green pixels of the CCD sensor react with more sensitive to ultra@@ violet light than the pixels in odd lines , this difference creates a grid pattern in the output . this option draws the image a little soft , but eliminates the 2x@@ 2 grid pattern with the V@@ N@@ G@@ - or A@@ HD quality method . &quot;
&quot; if this option is set , the white balance of the camera is used . otherwise , if set , the automatic color balance is used . &quot;
&quot; this setting is only used when the white balance is not set . default is to use a solid color balance , which was photographed in the sunlight on a white card . &quot;
this setting is supported only for Fu@@ ji Super CCD SL@@ R cameras . using the second sensors has the effect of receiving under@@ exposed images in four steps more details in the spot@@ lights . for other cameras this option is ignored .
&quot; the default is the top lights , so the parts of your pictures are burned into the settings because of the inability of your camera to catch the lights as a penet@@ rating white . finally , use the setting through white in the settings . finally , you can attempt to re@@ construct some parts of missing information from the top lights . &quot;
&quot; this is possible because blue pixels are generally not as fast as green and red . &amp; cra@@ w therefore try to re@@ construct the missing green and red parts from the still uns@@ atur@@ ated blue pixels . of course , this is a question of how much color or white you want . &quot;
&quot; if you select the re@@ constructing option , you get the possibility to set a level . here is a value of three a compromise and / should therefore be individually adapted for each image . &quot;
&quot; set the lumin@@ ance value according to your taste . you probably need to set it slightly higher than the standard 1 . however , this can be done later in the image options of the &amp; digi@@ cam ; -@@ Image editing . to keep the time for the Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing small , you should proceed conserv@@ atively . &quot;
&quot; a Dem@@ os@@ a@@ icing algorithm is a digital image process to calculate a complete image from the partial raw data generated by the color filtered image sensor , which has many cameras and which provides a matrix of coloured pixels . this algorithm is also known as CF@@ A inter@@ pol@@ ation or color design . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; and D@@ cra@@ w provide you with three alternatives : bil@@ ine@@ ar , V@@ NG inter@@ pol@@ ation and A@@ HD inter@@ pol@@ ation . after some tests , it looks as if A@@ HD Inter@@ pol@@ ation ( for Adap@@ tive Hom@@ ogen@@ ic Direc@@ ted ) was the first algorithm used by D@@ cra@@ w . &quot;
&quot; if you know the color deviation of your lenses , you can set the red and blue pro@@ o@@ fre@@ ading values here . this is certainly the best method for a color deviation correction , since it is carried out during the shell conversion . &quot;
a profile transl@@ ates the color information and gives instructions how to be given back . there is also L@@ CMS and &amp; digi@@ kam ; information such as color information from a colour space to translate into the other so that the colors are as accurate as possible .
behavior Ques@@ tions when a picture is opened in image editing / Start color management module with raw files .
&quot; color Profile Fol@@ der here the folder , such as / usr / share / color / ICC or / home / user / .@@ color / ICC , where you can save all your profiles . &quot;
settings of ICC profiles you have here the possibility &amp; quot ; standard squ@@ ot ; for your profiles to deposit . everything can be changed when opening the raw file .
the color management view is an alternative to X@@ cali@@ b or Ar@@ gy@@ ll . here only your pictures are color managed not the entire screen .
&quot; not all profiles are created in the same way . there are some , like e.g. Canon , which do not contain any color mapping or g@@ amma correction . currently , d@@ cra@@ w G@@ amma is not corrected for conver@@ sions at 16 bit depth . this means that you need to perform the color mapping itself . &quot;
&quot; there are other options such as the Soft Pro@@ of Profile , with which you can em@@ ulate how your image would be returned from one device . this is very useful before you print image since your printer has a smaller color range than your camera and some colors can therefore be very saturated . this could be manually corrected instead of relying on the blind algorithm of your printer . &quot;
&quot; for most cameras , it is quite obvious which colour profile is intended for them . unfortunately , not on the models of Canon . therefore , here follows a table of cameras and profiles that fit together . this answer is of course in@@ official : &quot;
&quot; the Canon profile extension allows you to recognize the style for the target : F for an exact style , L for landscapes , N for Neut@@ ral , P for portrait and S for standard style . &quot;
&quot; K@@ IP@@ I is the &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug @-@ in interface . it is an interface that is supported by a number of &amp; k@@ de ; image viewer and image editing . by deplo@@ ying this interface , &amp; digi@@ cam ; many modules that have been written to work with any program that supports the K@@ IP@@ I interface . &quot;
&quot; if your distribution has installed the K@@ IP@@ I modules , you will see a list of available modules . select the modules you want to use and these are then loaded by &amp; digi@@ cam ; these modules will appear as new entries in the menu of the main window and in addition you will also find some in the context menu of the preview . &quot;
&quot; short commands for tasks performed by modules can be set in the menu under Settings &quot; &quot; Sh@@ ort@@ cuts &quot; . &quot; &quot;
further information ( in English ) about K@@ IP@@ I modules can be obtained via the K@@ IP@@ I project under ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ki@@ pi @-@ plu@@ g@@ ins@@ .org or in the manuals of the K@@ IP@@ I modules .
&quot; the slide show settings should be easy to understand . the upper knob controls the time between the image transitions , usually 4 @-@ 5 seconds . the other check boxes turn the metadata on or off , which are displayed at the bottom of the pictures during the ad . &quot;
&quot; the camera features on the left are a list of all the cameras supported currently . on the right @-@ hand side there is a button Automatic detection , which attempts to identify a camera that is connected to the computer . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom , you can set the path for US@@ B@@ - and Fire@@ Wire ( IE@@ EE @-@ 13@@ 94 or i @-@ Link ) mass storage cameras . &quot;
&quot; to use your digital camera with &amp; digi@@ cam ; to use , you need to connect the camera to your computer , bring it into the display mode and turn on . &quot;
&quot; if not , you can set camera model and port manually . after you have set up your camera , your camera will appear in the camera menu . &quot;
&quot; you can select any name for your camera . this will be displayed in the main window of the main window . if you have more than one camera , you can paste it here . &quot;
&quot; with the confirmation dialog option for moving images in the garbage b@@ ins , you can set the conversation of &amp; digi@@ code ; when del@@ eting a photo in an album , you will find more details in the blan@@ king of a photo and del@@ eting an album . &quot;
&quot; the editorial changes caused by the right side bar can be used sil@@ ently by &amp; digi@@ kam , if you use the option to apply changes in the right side bar without re@@ viewing . otherwise , you will need to save the changes with the button modifications . &quot;
&quot; you can also display the display of the welcome screen by &amp; digi@@ kam , which speeds up the start of &amp; digi@@ ti@@ sed under certain circumstances . &quot;
&quot; if something is deleted from the base folder , ask &amp; digi@@ cam ; if something is deleted from the base folder , you want it to delete it from the database . &quot;
different color schemes can be edited in &amp; edited ; you can select the main window to suit your taste . you can select these settings under Settings Design from the tool@@ bar . a preview of the available designs is listed below :
&quot; these designs have been defined in simple text files . if you are interested in creating a new design for &amp; digi@@ kam , you will find more information about this in this tutorial . &quot;
&amp; digi@@ cam ; contains a fast image editing with some base tools . you can use them to view your photos and to correct and improve . image editing can be started by clicking with the left mouse button on the preview of an image or through the context menu of preview and selection of the item ads / editing .
&quot; the image editing contains a number of tools to improve your images . some of them are available as modules in &amp; digi@@ kam , so you may not be part of your distribution . for more information on the K@@ IP@@ I modules , please refer to the Image processing section . &quot;
&quot; displays a status line at the bottom of the window , the file name , current file number , magni@@ fication factor , and the current image size . &quot;
a menu bar at the top and below the tool@@ bar for quick access to the most commonly required functions .
&quot; the editing functions of image editing change your photos . however , none of the functions will change the original photo before using File Save or Save the Save button from the tool@@ bar . note that you can no longer restore the original photo once you have saved the image . &quot;
so you may want to make a copy of your image before you change it . you can save it with Save As .
&quot; as long as you have not saved the photo , you can restore the original image by using the Rest@@ ore menu from the File menu or use the Rest@@ ore image processing button in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
virtually any image processing action can be und@@ one or restored . you can undo the last action by selecting Edit undo or restore by selecting Edit Rest@@ ore from the menu .
&quot; if you use this frequently , you should make the keyboard short@@ cuts , C@@ trl ; -@@ Z to undo and remember C@@ trl ; -@@ Shift @-@ Z to restore . &quot;
&quot; if you press the &amp; L@@ MB ; press the undo or restore button in the tool@@ bar for a moment , you will receive a context menu . if you select one of the menu entries , all actions in between will also be und@@ one or restored . &quot;
&quot; once you have started editing , you can move between the photos on the same album or the same keyword by using the navigation buttons in the tool@@ bar , image up , image down or the entries in the File menu . if you have made changes to the current photo , you will be asked if you want to save it . &quot;
you can enter the photo and zoom out in which you use C@@ trl ; mouse wheel or symbols in the tool@@ bar or the entries in the check menu .
&quot; to adjust a photo to the window size , you can use this button in the tool@@ bar : select En@@ lar@@ ing factor automatically &quot;
&quot; view Full Screen mode displays the photo in full screen mode . you enter the normal view in which you use the Es@@ c key . normally , you can change the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; if you want to print the current image , you can print image in the File menu and get the Standard &amp; k@@ de ; Prin@@ ter dialog . you can adjust the settings here before printing your photo . &quot;
&quot; from the main menu you can print single images or whole sentences . whole picture preview pages can be printed out of your choice . you only need to select the images using the standard methods and select from the Album Ex@@ porting Prin@@ ter Assistant . if you follow the wizard , you only need to make your choice . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; digi@@ code ; main window has a side bar at the right edge , which provides important information and actions for the selected images . the same side@@ bar is , without the navigation file , also available in image editing . it is displayed when one of the five riders is cli@@ cked : &quot;
multiple clicks on the same tab allow the side@@ bar to appear or disappear into the margin .
the text is UT@@ F @-@ 8 compatible . this means that all special characters are allowed . the cap@@ tions are copied to the EX@@ IF and IP@@ T@@ C@@ - fields so that you can be used by other programs .
&quot; IP@@ TC data only support ASCII characters and are limited to 2000 characters . all comments are cut off after 2000 characters and special characters are re @-@ formed . if you want to use the IP@@ TC label in other applications , you should consider these limitations . &quot;
&quot; after you have commented it , use either the user button or simply switch to the next image , the cap@@ tions are then saved . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the apply button , there is a button More . with this you can read more metadata from the selected file or the database . however , you can also write the metadata into the files . however , this is always done when you selected a metadata setting that is always written into the images . &quot;
the comment section shows a rating scheme of 0 to 5 stars and can be used in search and sorting . it can be applied either with a single mouse click on the 5 stars in the side@@ bar or using the keyboard short@@ cut C@@ trl + 0 ... 5 . to rate multiple images at the same time select them and use the context menu .
the evaluation is written in the IP@@ TC field . the code follows the diagram in the following table :
&quot; the keyword view shows a search box for filtering the keywords , the keyword tree and a selection box with the keywords applied in this and digi@@ code session . &quot;
the keyword tree is dynamically adapted to the typ@@ ed search word . you can quickly restrict the number of options when searching for a keyword . this ability is particularly useful when you have many keywords .
&quot; the input field at the bottom is further facilit@@ ating when entering keywords in a series of images . if you have entered different keywords , they will be saved for quick access . &quot;
keywords can also be set by marking the corresponding check boxes in the tree . all keywords of an image are stored to the IP@@ TC keyword .
&quot; if you select multiple images in the main view and select a keyword in the keyword tree , this will only be applied to the highlighted image and not to the entire selection , if you want to provide a selection with a keyword , please refer to the Key@@ word filter section . &quot;
&quot; the page bar keyword filter is used to change the selection of the images shown in the main window . usually , the left side bar with their album , - dates , keyword and search views is used . if additionally one or more keyword filters are used from the right side , only the intersection of these two is displayed . all created keywords are available . &quot;
&quot; you can also drag and drop tags . suppose you have selected several images in the main view to provide you with keywords . if the keyword already exists , you can simply drag it from the right side bar and put it on the selection . &quot;
&quot; in the upper example , the main window displays the images on a calendar day . the keyword filter is based on a keyword , which reduces the amount to three images . &quot;
this search for changes takes place at every start of the program . it can also be switched off under settings Mis@@ cell@@ aneous .
&quot; if you have a rule with and created and find that it should be one or more , you can easily change this by double @-@ clicking on the text and in the control area . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) : the entry that is searched in the database . this can be an album , name , keyword , image , keyword , etc . &quot;
&quot; ( 3 ) : the argument for the operator , which is a name or string , which is already set in the database . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can specify an Advanced search over all elements of the database using the following options : &quot;
&quot; if you want to group options , you only need the check box at the end of the rule and then use the group@@ ing button . the options will then look like this : &quot;
why were Pic@@ as@@ a@@ web and Fli@@ ck@@ r not listed ? the free storage space is limited to 1 GB and you will not want to store the images in full resolution there .
this article / tutorial was written mainly by El@@ le Stone . special thanks to El@@ le for this work . I have mainly adapted it to &amp; digi@@ kam ; s concrete implementation .
&quot; the reason why you use a color @-@ managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scann@@ ed colors . with a color @-@ managed workflow , you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital dark@@ room . &quot;
&quot; when the theme is based on color management , everyone wants to know which buttons he wants to press for the results he wants . unfortunately , color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing work@@ flows . in addition , you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management . in addition , you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result . &quot;
&quot; if your image workflow meets all six criteria listed below , you don &apos;t need to worry about color management . &quot;
you work on a monitor that is calibr@@ ated to the s@@ RGB colour space . ( more information can be found below )
&quot; your only other image issues are by e @-@ mail or web , where s@@ RGB is de facto standard . &quot;
&quot; so if s@@ RGB works so well and makes life so easy for everyone , why should one use another color space and have to worry about color administr@@ ations ? &quot;
&quot; a visual example of the limitation of s@@ RGB compared to the colors we can really see is presented below . it shows a 2 @-@ dimensional representation of all colors we can see , the hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e region , and the colors in s@@ RGB colour space , the tri@@ angular region . &quot;
&quot; if you want to compare the 2 @-@ dimensional representation of s@@ RGB with some larger color spaces , visit Bruce Lind@@ blo@@ oms excellent site and just click on info and then click Information About RGB Working Sp@@ aces . &quot;
do I need to alli@@ g@@ ate my monitor if I chose to work only in the s@@ RGB colour space ?
&quot; yes ! whether you are working in s@@ RGB colour space or not , you need to c@@ alli@@ bri@@ ghter your monitor because s@@ RGB proceeds from your ; on@@ itor to s@@ RGB is locked . if you are working as in the colour space of s@@ RGB , you have to either use your monitor on the s@@ RGB standard , use a matching monitor profile or both . &quot;

&quot; this tool provides five automatic correc@@ tions that can improve a picture in most cases . therefore , use it before attempting any further manual processing . &quot;
&quot; the functions norm@@ alize , adjust , Automatic balance and contrast extend from the Menu Cor@@ rec@@ ting Automatic correction automatically try to make your colors the best . you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo . &quot;
norm@@ alize : this method scales the leu@@ k@@ velocity values across the whole picture so that the dark@@ est dot is black and the brigh@@ test point as brigh@@ tly as possible without changing its shade . this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced .
&quot; this method mim@@ ics the intensity channel of the colors of the selected image , so that the hist@@ ogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible . sometimes , the comparison results in very good results when improving the contrast of an image , sometimes it produces only rub@@ b@@ ish . it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destro@@ ys it . &quot;
&quot; automatic lev@@ elling : this method maxim@@ izes the colour range in the red , green and blue channel . &quot;
add a contrast : this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new ji@@ b of all values in between . this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for poor photos .
white balance from &amp; digi@@ kam ; is a semi @-@ automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo .
&quot; the white balance correction is slightly limited because of a colour space with 8 @-@ bit per color . if you can be too far from the original picture , areas with over@@ exposure may occur . if you can perform the white balance in raw mode , which works in 16 @-@ bit mode , your options for correction will be better . &quot;
this tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pa@@ wel T. J@@ och@@ ym . they start it over the menu entry colors white balance of image processing .
&quot; the preview window can be adjusted in size . on the left , both the original picture and the preview of the target image can be seen . the preview will dynamically change the settings of the tool . if you want to see the original white balance again , then it is enough to click on the sub@@ window . &quot;
the preview of the target image has a red marker . the lumin@@ ance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the hist@@ ogram .
&quot; at the top right , a hist@@ ogram is displayed that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter . this hist@@ ogram is very helpful , even in well @-@ lit pictures , most pixels have very small lumin@@ ance values . &quot;
&quot; the contrast of your result depends on shadows , satur@@ ation and g@@ amma . the shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos . &quot;
&quot; to play An@@ stat with the above controls , you should use the color temperature pi@@ p@@ ette . press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the chosen colour to calculate the color temperature of the white balance . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can set the white balance to the list of preferences . the following settings are available : &quot;
the exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is over@@ exposed .. You will see the combined result displayed in the white balance . this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad Buttons make exactly that . each setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and then load it again later .
&quot; the Pre@@ ferences button returns all filter values to its default values and the associated neutral white balance . note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original . if you save this , your original image will be changed . &quot;
&quot; 8 @-@ bit coding is the widely used JPEG format , 16 @-@ bit coding is better suited for high @-@ quality images . however , this coding also requires more disk space , computing time and is only available for the formats P@@ NG , P@@ N@@ M , TI@@ FF and D@@ NG . &quot;
this tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles . it uses the change and assignment of color profiles .
&quot; another important tool is available in the menu under shades of tone correction . this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time , so that you can use them for several photos . this is helpful if your camera or scann@@ ers always need the same error , so you will always need the same correction . &quot;
a very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gra@@ dation that you can find under colors gra@@ dation in the menu .
&quot; the digi@@ code ; tool color effects provide four color effects , a solar system effect , a Vel@@ via filter , a ne@@ on effect and a can@@ ter filter . &quot;
&quot; in times of chemical processing , it was called Sab@@ ati@@ er , also known as Sab@@ ati@@ er . the coloured , darker areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light . this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inver@@ ted by the second light . this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine . &quot;
the intensity controls the Solar@@ isation . at about 50 % intensity the picture shows what is chem@@ ically possible . another increase finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper .
this is an example of the Solar@@ isation effect . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this is processed ( 2 ) . the applied intensity is 30 % .
&quot; the Vi@@ vi@@ d filter simul@@ ates the so @-@ called &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vi@@ aqu@@ ot ; effect . it differs from a satur@@ ation by making a stronger contrast effect , which makes the colors brilliant and g@@ lowing . just try it , it embell@@ ishes many photos . &quot;
Vel@@ via is the brand name for an inver@@ ted color film produced by the Japanese company Fu@@ ji@@ film . the name is a composition of &amp; quot ; Vel@@ vet Medi@@ aqu@@ ot ; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure . Vel@@ via offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts .
the ne@@ on filter simul@@ ates ne@@ on light on the contrast edges . the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repeti@@ tions the strength of the ne@@ on light .
digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not un@@ common to change the color contrast and intensity of the photo . you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors . all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview .
&quot; if you make a photo in poor light conditions , you can get the opposite problem : a too large satur@@ ation . also in this case , the tool for brightness / satur@@ ation is a good choice to reduce satur@@ ation rather than increase it . if you like the result , you can confirm the changes with O@@ k . &quot;
&quot; between the complex mould gra@@ dation and the simple lumin@@ ous intensity / contrast / g@@ amma , the tool is based on ton@@ ing correction for improving exposure . even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated , you need only the range of sli@@ ders for the application described here . more concrete the three sli@@ ders below the hist@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; the window contains a graph of intensity values , a hist@@ ogram , the active channel or the selected area . below the graph three sli@@ ders can be cli@@ cked in and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image . the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas . &quot;
the easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controls and take care of how the picture changes .
&quot; the preview will be updated dynamically , based on the settings of the image . on the left side , the following options are available . &quot;
sc@@ aling : this selection box can be used to determine whether the hist@@ ogram is displayed with a linear or log@@ arith@@ mic Y axis . for images of a digital camera the linear hist@@ ogram is often dominated by a single pillar . in this case the log@@ arith@@ mic classification is more useful .
&quot; three controls : the top for the dark tones , the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones , often called g@@ amma values . &quot;
&quot; the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows , middle and light tones automatically . in addition , there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment . &quot;
&quot; output values : the output values allow the selection of manual values for each area . there are also two controllers that can be used to inter@@ actively use the output values as in the input values . for example , the compression of the output values can be used to create a hidden image as background while something else is to be seen in the foreground . &quot;
&quot; automatically : with this button , the image values are set automatically depending on the intensity values of the image . &quot;
save as and load : using these buttons you can save the set values in the fil@@ esystem and load them later . the Gim@@ p level format is used for this purpose .
&quot; if you use this mode and the three color pi@@ pet@@ tes , the input value is automatically adjusted for all shadows , means and sun shades . enable the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the preview of the original image to set the values of the hist@@ ogram for red , green , blue and the L@@ umin@@ escent channels . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ lay indicator controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
&quot; below is an example of the alignment of the input values applied to the red , green and blue channel of a photo . intensity and alpha channel , as well as the output values are unchanged . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected picture ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the left hand side , half of the original and the target image are displayed . the preview is dynamically updated depending on your settings . on the right side , the following options are available : &quot;
modified channel : this selection box allows to specify the channel that is changed by the module :
&quot; in addition to this box , there are two symbols to switch between a linear and log@@ arith@@ mic view . for images captured with a digital camera , the linear mode is mostly the most sensible . in this case , the log@@ arith@@ mic mode is used . &quot;
&quot; for example , if you move a curve to the right , for example , the light tones , then you can see that these bright tones correspond to darker dé@@ cor and that the corresponding pixels become darker . &quot;
&quot; on the preview of the original photo is a red marker to see . if you want to move this mark to the area you want to change , a matching line is displayed on the curve that represents the original value . create a point on this line and move it on and off until the value is adjusted to your taste . &quot;
save as and load : using these buttons you can do exactly that . each curve you created can be saved in the file system and loaded later . the file format for this is the Gim@@ p curve format .
&quot; activate the color pi@@ p@@ ette you want to use and click on the original image to set the control points for the red , green , blue and lumin@@ ance curve . &quot;
&quot; the Over@@ lay indicator controls all color channels to display over @-@ exposed pixels . if displayed in more than one channel , you get the combined result . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and it is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a black @-@ and @-@ white photo that was corrected in the L@@ umin@@ ance channel . shadow and sun shades were placed with the color pi@@ p@@ ette and applied to the curves . the original picture is ( 1 ) and the corrected ( 2 ) .
the channel Mixer is the &amp; digi@@ code ; Image editing is a tool to improve the color channels or change the color shades of the photo .
the channel mixer is another sophisticated tool to mix the colors of the images . you can edit it from the menu colors channel @-@ Mixer of image editing .
&quot; with the channel selection box , you can select the color for the hist@@ ogram : this gives you a first indication of how to correct the channels by viewing the relative distribution and output . the left pane of the window shows you a preview . &quot;
&quot; the view of the target image has a red marker . if you position it in the picture , a vertical line appears in the hist@@ ogram to show you the corresponding color value . &quot;
&quot; controls for the module are right below : controls for red , green and construction allow you to mix these channels . if you activate L@@ umin@@ ance , the image will retain the overall brightness even when you change the corresponding color components . this is particularly convenient when you also use the option Mon@@ ochro@@ me as the channel mixer then is THE tool for generating great black and white conver@@ sions of your photos . try to reduce the green channel for black and white portraits . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , especially when you mix mon@@ ochro@@ me , the reduction of a color leads to a visible noise coming from the colour . color space consists of small noise files that do not appear in the same place in the color channel and their noise patterns in each channel look different . if that is the case , you can improve your mon@@ ochro@@ me conversion in which you first reduce the color space . &quot;
the storage as and store buttons are used for this purpose . any bl@@ ender setting can be saved for later and then load . the used file format is the Gim@@ p channel mixer format .
&quot; the Over@@ lay indicator controls all color channels to locate over@@ exposed pixels and show you the combined result of all channels . this is an indicator , i.e. you get the effect only in preview and there is no effect on the final result . &quot;
below you can see a picture in which the blue channel was read@@ ju@@ sted . the option L@@ umin@@ ance is checked . the original image is shown in ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) .
&quot; black / white photography has always been fascinating because of your abstra@@ ction . with the development of digital photography , black / white is a work step , as color images can be simply converted to the computer . also with a set of film roll profiles . &quot;
&quot; Il@@ ford Delta 100 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 , Il@@ ford Delta 400 Pro 3@@ 200 , Il@@ ford FP@@ 4 Plus , Il@@ ford Pan@@ F Plus , Il@@ ford X@@ P2 Super &quot;
&quot; green Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a green lens filter . this looks good , with all scene pictures and fits especially well to portraits of the sky . so much like the 00@@ 4 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) green filter . &quot;
&quot; orange Fil@@ ters : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with an orange lens filter . this improves landscapes , maritime scenes and aerial photos . so much like the 00@@ 2 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) orange filter . &quot;
red Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a red lens filter . this creates dramatic cel@@ esti@@ al effects and can simulate lun@@ ar light scenes at day@@ time . so similar to the 00@@ 3 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) red filter .
yellow Filter : simul@@ ates a black / white film exposure with a yellow lens filter . this is the most natural color tone correction and improves the contrast . it is ideal for landscapes and thus similar to the 001 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) yellow filter .
s@@ epi@@ aton : produces warm light and medium tones while it adds a bit of cold in the shad@@ ow@@ ls . this is very similar to the process of leaving a pressure and re@@ development in a s@@ epi@@ at@@ onic . this is typical of the photos of your grandmother and thus similar to the 00@@ 5 C@@ ok@@ in ( t@@ m ) s@@ epi@@ af@@ il@@ ter .
use the &amp; digi@@ code ; apply tool texture you can apply decorative tex@@ tures to an image .
&quot; by adding a texture to your image , regardless of whether it is a color picture or not , you can make it look like an oil painting on a screen , the stit@@ ch of an old master , a pop art portrait of enlarged points or like a mur@@ al on a wall . &quot;
relief : move this parameter to the right increases the appearance of the depth and / or three @-@ dimension@@ ality of the texture in the image .
a paper text effect has been applied in the photo below . the original image is ( 1 ) and the changed under ( 2 ) . the parameter relief has been set to 200 .
&quot; with the &amp; digi@@ code ; add tool frame , a decorative frame can be added to a picture . &quot;
keeping the eye of an observer in the limits of a photo is not an easy task . one way to keep his attention is to set the picture a decorative frame . this is a psychological barrier for the sc@@ attering eye .
&quot; type : with this parameter you set the desired frame type for your image . throughout , the picture ran@@ ged with a colored line , Ni@@ ep@@ ce surrounds it with a thin line and a wide frame ( ideal for black and white images ) , bev@@ elled it with a nice three @-@ dimensional frame . ideal for a bone effect and decorative add a decorative frame with patterns . &quot;
width : indicates the width of the frame in percent . the value range for the width is limited from 1 % to 50 % .
&quot; this will be greater than the original , but have the same aspect ratio . this is important for the print of the pictures , especially if you have used the tool Fol@@ low aspect ratio before . &quot;
&quot; with this handy tool , you can easily insert a format@@ ted text into an image at any place . this also works in several places if you need it . &quot;
&quot; use text direction , orientation , color from the color space and the character set with its properties as you need it . you will simply choose a frame around the text and / or a half @-@ transparent background . &quot;
&quot; each setting you chose for your text can be changed until you press the button &quot; &quot; OK &quot; . &quot; once the image has been saved , the text is part of the image . it cannot be changed any more . &quot;
use the &amp; digi@@ code ; apply tool template you can put a template across a picture .
the Image template menu apply in image editing can be used to place templates over a picture .
&quot; for the template there are no limitations regarding size and orientation . however , you must take the P@@ NG file format and should work with maximum compression ( 9 ) for the reduction of the file size of the template . if you want to add your template / template database , just send an email in English to the template ; mailing list digi@@ code @-@ users @ k@@ de@@ .org .. &quot;
&quot; when using this tool for the first time , you need to put your sten@@ cil folder with the button base folder in the dialog . select the folder in which you have copied the template files . these settings will be noted for the next start . &quot;
&quot; after the root folder has been set for templates , a tree view appears that reflects the folder structure of the template folder . selecting a folder automatically updates the template &apos;s thumb@@ nail . &quot;
below the thumb@@ nail you will find three buttons with which you can change the magni@@ fying factor and the position of your image .
enlarge : this button enlar@@ ges the underlying image . it is centered around the position of the mouse . check it with the left mouse button .
&quot; it is centered around the position of the mouse . if you want to apply the template to the whole picture , you need to shrink the image accordingly . check it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; move this button to move the image below the template . to do this , take the picture and place it at the desired position . &quot;
use OK if you want to apply the template to your image . the image will then automatically adjust the preview size .
&amp; digi@@ cam ; provides three different tools to focus . each of you has benefits in other areas .
&quot; sharpen@@ ing is a traditional tool for sharpen@@ ing . it is very fast and easy , but generates , especially in dark areas , gra@@ iny images . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ red mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture shar@@ per look blur@@ red . actually , it does not work a bit , it works rather psych@@ ovis@@ ual . you can use it to remove atmospheric ha@@ ze and it makes here a really good job . the algorithm was taken from Gim@@ p and it is protected by W@@ inst@@ on Ch@@ ang . &quot;
re@@ focusing is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharp@@ ness . it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment .
images without focus as well as most digi@@ ti@@ zed images require a correction of the sharp@@ ness . this is because of the digi@@ tization process colours with only minimal differences to a color point . this in turn results in sharp edges becoming a little blur@@ red . the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper . SL@@ R cameras usually need more subsequently sharpen@@ ing than normal cameras for private users .
&quot; in JPEG images , a camera has often been used for internal sharpen@@ ing . however , pictures in the raw format must always be sharpen@@ ed during processing . &quot;
&quot; some scann@@ ers use a focus filter already during the reading of the image . if you de@@ activate it , you get control over your image . &quot;
in some situations you can get useful results by sharpen@@ ing a photo using the sharpen@@ ing tool . you can use this with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ ting sharpen@@ ing .
&quot; the sharp@@ ness increases the sharp@@ ness of the edges , but also ampli@@ fies the noise . in general , the most useful technique for sharpen@@ ing an image will re@@ focus the tool . you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpen@@ ing through the menu entry . &quot;
sometimes you have the opposite problem : a picture is too cris@@ p . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to shar@@ pen . use the tool for sof@@ ter with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with settings . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo .
the filter Un@@ sharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos . a demonstration can be seen here .
the original image and the preview help to edit the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings .
&quot; there are two important parameters , the radius and the amount . the default values often produce good results and should first be tried . an increase in radius or viewing ampli@@ fy the effect . &quot;
the radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter . high @-@ resolution images allow larger radi@@ i .
&quot; the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blur@@ red image , which is added to the original . thus , the strength of the sharp@@ ness is set . &quot;
&quot; the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference in difference . thus , a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filter . thus , areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharp@@ ness and hence beauty defects in faces , heavens and water surfaces are avoided . &quot;
&quot; the original image is the ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . un@@ sharp mask was used with radius = 6.0 , amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0 . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ code ; tool re@@ focus re@@ focuses a picture by improving the sharp@@ ness . it used the copy@@ righ@@ ted extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Li@@ ppe .
this is a better approach than just trying to shar@@ pen the photo . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . it uses a technique called FI@@ R Wiener Fil@@ tering . the traditional technique for sharpen@@ ing images is the use of a blur@@ red mask .
&quot; the G@@ auss &apos;s folding has a very long tail , which results in the mathematical result also from the source pix@@ eln , which is far from the original source pixel , which results in most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels . it causes unwanted results . &quot;
&quot; circular sharp@@ ness : this is the radius of the circular folding . it is the most important parameter for using this module . for most images , the default value should give 1 good results . &quot;
&quot; correlation : an increase in correlation may help to reduce arti@@ facts . the correlation may be selected from 0 @-@ 1 . useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1 , &amp; eg ; 0.@@ 95 and 0.@@ 99 . a high value for correlation reduces the shar@@ per effect of the module . &quot;
&quot; noise filter : an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce arti@@ facts . the filter can take values of 0 @-@ 1 . however , values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful . if the noise filter is too low , &amp; eg ; 0 the image quality becomes very bad . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : this is the radius for the palate . use this parameter if your sharp@@ ness is gau@@ ze . in most cases , you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying arti@@ facts . if you use a value un@@ equal to zero , you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter . &quot;
&quot; matrix Size : this value determines the size of the transformation matrix . an increase in the matrix size can produce good results , especially if you select large values for the circular sharp@@ ness or the palate . in most cases , you should choose a value in the range of 3 @-@ 10 . &quot;
the Save as and Lo@@ ad Buttons are used for this purpose . any re@@ focused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded .
&quot; try to perform all tri@@ mming , color and intensity correc@@ tions on the image before using the module . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , you should use the module before changing the image otherwise . the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible , but later leave unpleasant art@@ ef@@ acts . &quot;
&quot; when you read and comp@@ ress images , eg ; than JPEG , you should apply the module to the un@@ compressed image . &quot;
generally Un@@ inten@@ sely Mas@@ king produces better results than sharpen@@ ing . this could be caused by un@@ inten@@ tional mas@@ king a larger neighbourhood used as sharpen@@ ing .
&quot; theoretically , un@@ sharp mask must always produce art@@ ef@@ acts . even under optimal conditions , it can never remove the effect of blur@@ ring . for the Viennese filter it is impossible to show that it is the optimum Lin@@ e@@ are Filter . the FI@@ R Vienna filter is often better in processing small details . &quot;
below you can see a comparison between the different filters used on a small un@@ focused image :
the original un@@ sharp ink that needs to be corrected . this image has been made with an analog camera . the un@@ focused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens .
for more information on the focus correction methods in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address .
the G@@ lät@@ te knob uses the blur@@ ring of the area that has been dark@@ ened to create a more natural pup@@ il .
&quot; the ink ink allows for a modified colour for the pup@@ il . if you want to use blue eyes instead of dark ones , you can adjust this here . &quot;
the tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove unwanted arti@@ facts with unprecedented speed .
the In@@ painting algorithm was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project .
this tool contains various pres@@ ets as starting points to simplify the restoration . the available pres@@ ets are listed below :
&quot; if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely , you can use the tab smooth@@ ing and advanced settings . &quot;
&quot; detailed maintenance p &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this controls the maintenance of the details . a small value leads to an even smooth@@ ness over the picture . a value of 0.@@ 9 should be kept for details so that no sharpen@@ ing is necessary afterwards . &quot;
direction dependency Alpha &#91; 0.@@ 100 &#93; : a small value smooth@@ es evenly across all directions while a value close to 1 is smooth@@ ed in one direction . if you have a film gran@@ ul@@ ator or CCD noise will generate a high value wave @-@ like patterns . JPEG Artef@@ acts are best removed at a value near 1 .
&quot; smooth@@ ing &#91; 0 , 500 &#93; : this sets the maximum smooth@@ ing factor above all@@ it@@ . p then defines the relative smooth@@ ing . therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary when there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
repeat : speci@@ fies how often the algorithm is going through . normally here 1 or 2 is sufficient .
&quot; angle @-@ range da &#91; 5 , 90 &#93; : angle @-@ dependent integration of an@@ is@@ otrop@@ ic alpha . if Alpha is selected small , it should also be small . make sure that small angles get a long run@@ time . so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs . &quot;
&quot; integral step width &#91; 0,1 , 10 &#93; : integral stri@@ de width in pixels . you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub @-@ pixel smooth@@ ing and never greater than 2 . &quot;
use linear inter@@ pol@@ ation : the more the quality you receive by selecting this option is only minor . it doubles the duration . we therefore recommend it to leave it out .
the Save as and Lo@@ ad Buttons make exactly this . correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and then loaded again later .
&quot; correc@@ ting image errors is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and drag a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
&quot; the module is applied on a photo that was made in Guatemala City with an analog camera . as you can see , there is an odd black art@@ ef@@ act in the foreground that caused by bad film storage during the trip . &quot;
the &amp; digi@@ code ; noise reduction is a very powerful tool to reduce noise . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Peter Heck@@ ert .
&quot; this tool provides sel@@ ectable image filters to remove stain@@ s and other arti@@ facts , for example , dust or hair on the lens . it can also be used to remove sensor noise from the camera or Mo@@ i@@ re@@ acute ; effects of scann@@ ed images from books or magazines . &quot;
&quot; if you need more information about sensor noise from digital cameras , you can read them in English in this tutorial . &quot;
the screen@@ shot above shows a typical scene made with a digital camera and a high ISO sensitivity . it shows a gra@@ ined noise that can be successfully removed with this tool .
&quot; in the following you will find a complete description of all parameters . in most cases , you only need the sub@@ window details and the Advanced Settings window can remain with the default settings . &quot;
&quot; radius controls the window size , from 1 ( 3@@ x@@ 3 ) to 20 ( 4@@ 1@@ x@@ 41 ) used for the filter . large values increase the time the filter needs per pixel and can bl@@ ur the image . the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smooth@@ ed and therefore cuts smaller faults . &quot;
&quot; sharp@@ ness : controls the sharp@@ ness level . this value sets the pixel spac@@ ing the filter looks forward to determine lumin@@ ance changes . if the value is too high , the adaptive filter image details cannot be maintained and noise or lubric@@ ating occurs again . &quot;
&quot; this value improves the frequency response of the filter . if it is too strong , not the entire noise can be removed or craw@@ ler tips can occur . set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG art@@ ef@@ acts without losing details . &quot;
lumin@@ ance : controls the lumin@@ ance tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
color : controls the color tolerance of the image . we recommend to change color or lumin@@ ance to improve a picture . these settings do not affect the smooth@@ ing process that is controlled by the details settings .
&quot; g@@ amma : controls the tolerance vari@@ ance of the image . this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas , which are typically stronger , but also s@@ me@@ ars the shadow areas . &quot;
&quot; damp@@ ing : controls adjustment of phase j@@ itter absorption . this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius re@@ acts to variations of lumin@@ ance . if it is increased , the edges appear smo@@ other when it is too high . &quot;
store under and load : these buttons are used exactly for that . all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and later loaded .
this is an example of how noise reduction can change your life . the original image is marked with ( 1 ) and the corrected with ( 2 ) .
sometimes a picture is too cris@@ p for your purpose . the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than to shar@@ pen a picture . use tool for sof@@ ter with the menu entry Cor@@ rec@@ t sof@@ tness and experiment with the smooth@@ ness . the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; photo restoration is definitely one of the most advanced tools to reduce photo art@@ ef@@ acts .
&quot; this restoration filter gives you the possibility to remove a lot of unwanted arti@@ facts from your images . it is very well adapted to remove Gau@@ ß &apos;s noise , film gran@@ ul@@ arity , scrat@@ ches , compression art@@ ef@@ acts and local errors that appear in digital , original or subsequently digit@@ alized images . &quot;
&quot; the same algorithm can be used for color and texture replacement . the texture composition is performed using another tool , the error correction , and the algorithm for restoration has been developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / Fran@@ n@@ k@@ reich and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
&quot; JPEG Artef@@ acts Re@@ duce : compression of JPEG is not perfect , in some areas even very far from it . as a los@@ sy compression algorithm , it creates some compression &amp; quot ; Artef@@ ac@@ te@@ quot ; - small standards that can be seen in un@@ compressed image . this setting should correct these problems . &quot;
the Save as and Lo@@ ad Buttons make exactly that . any settings of photo restoration can be saved in a text file and loaded later .
&quot; photo restoration is comparatively very fast at work . however , it can take a very long time and drag a high CPU load . therefore , you can cancel the calculation at any time with the button Finish . &quot;
below you can be restored like a photo with uniform noise . the module is applied to a black and white photo that was recorded with a Min@@ ol@@ ta ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on an Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera on a Il@@ ford ( t@@ m ) 700@@ Si camera with a sensitivity of 3@@ 200 ISO .
&quot; below you can see another example of the photo restoration . this time , tex@@ tures were reduced to an old colour photo that was scann@@ ed with a scanner . &quot;
&quot; it uses algorithms from the J@@ PE@@ G@@ Pi@@ xi project , protected by copyright by Martin Dick@@ op@@ p . &quot;
&quot; bright , dead or hot pixels are a problem especially in high @-@ quality raw mode photos because many cameras with JPEG compression have a built @-@ in suppression for hot pixels . &quot;
&quot; this tool can be used to remove &amp; quot ; hot Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; and &quot; quot ; bright Pix@@ el@@ quot ; in a photo using a dark picture sub@@ traction method . there is currently no manual method to select the bad pixels .
download this file into the wizard with the dark image button . the tool will automatically detect the hot and bright pixels . these are highlighted in the image preview .
&quot; if you have an old digital camera , it is important that you record the dark image directly to detect new hot or bright pixels by CCD defects . &quot;
&quot; first , as described in the previous section , you should download the matching dark image to the image to be corrected . an automatic processing of the dark image will find the bad pixels . note that the wizard shows the last dark image and will automatically load it in the next session . &quot;
the image area and the preview will help you correct the result within the image . the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings . bad pixels are raised in all preview areas .
select an area to view the defective pixels on the preview and the results of the filter . select the best filter method to inter@@ pol@@ ate these pixel blocks . these are the filters available :
&quot; cut : an average of the adjacent pixel is determined . the resulting color is assigned to all defective pixels in the block . for a 1 @-@ dimensional inter@@ pol@@ ation , this is done separately for the horizontal and vertical line . &quot;
linear : all pixels that have a distance of 1 from the pixel block are drawn to the calculation of a bi @-@ linear surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of linear curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) . these are then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
square : this is the standard filter method . all pixels with a distance of 2 or less to pixel block are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ square interface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of square curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the pixels in the block .
cubic : all pixels with a distance of 3 or less are drawn to compu@@ te a bi @-@ cubic surface ( 2 @-@ dim ) or a group of cubic curves ( 1 @-@ dim ) that is then used to inter@@ pol@@ ate the defective pixels in the block .
&quot; below you can see the Hot@@ pixel correction on a color photo , from a defective digital camera with sensitivity of 200 ISO and long exposure . the original image was enlarged to 300 % ( 1 ) and the corrected image can be seen under ( 2 ) . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ code ; Vig@@ net@@ ting correction is a tool to correct the vi@@ gn@@ etting , i.e. under@@ exposed edges , of an image . &quot;
&quot; wide @-@ angle lenses , especially those in medium and large photo format , can frequently illumin@@ ate the entire sensor area . instead &amp; quot ; vi@@ gn@@ et@@ tier@@ en@@ quot ; ( sh@@ aded ) they can reduce the corners and edges of the image by reducing the light that reaches the sensor there . &quot;
&quot; many center filters require a factor of 1.5 or 2 in the ir@@ is filter , which increases the sh@@ utter speed in circumstances so that it is impossible to use the camera with the hand . wide angle lenses should also be used with center filters , an opening of f / 16 or less , since otherwise blur@@ ring effects arise by movement . &quot;
&quot; with the large exposure area of today &apos;s film and color or grey gra@@ dient of digital cameras and film scann@@ ers , it is possible to simulate the effect of a center filter by applying an equi@@ val@@ ente transformation on a rough image that has been done without this filter . the tool Vig@@ net@@ ting correction employs the transformation with a center filter on a picture . the algorithm is protected by copyright by John Walker . &quot;
&quot; with three controls , you can control the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction filter and with three more the exposure of the target image . &quot;
&quot; density : this parameter controls the degree of intensity atten@@ u@@ ation at the point of greatest density the filter . the standard density is 2.0 , which is an optical filter with an aperture setting of 1 , or by chance a lumin@@ ous intensity of 2 . &quot;
&quot; lumin@@ ous intensity , contrast and g@@ amma settings : editing an image with the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction reduces the lumin@@ osity of pixels . you need to adjust the exposure of the target image with these options . &quot;
&quot; if you want a more fine adjustment of the exposure of the target image , leave the values for lumin@@ osity / contrast / g@@ amma at zero and use the gra@@ dation from the color gra@@ dation . &quot;
this is an example of the Vig@@ net@@ ting correction applied to an image . the original image ( 1 ) shows the vi@@ gn@@ etting in the corners and ( 2 ) the corrected image .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; lens distortion is a tool to correct the impact of spher@@ ical lenses on photos . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by David Ho@@ dson .
this tool works with geometric distor@@ tions . color distortion can not be corrected with this tool .
the coefficient of the second grade handles the general geometric distortion of the lens and can correct the conc@@ ave or con@@ ve@@ x form of the image .
&quot; the coefficient of the third degree has a similar round effect , but fl@@ atten@@ s off the edges . this correction is not applied in the tool . &quot;
&quot; the coefficient of the fourth degree correc@@ ts the removed facets to that of the second degree . if you combine these two , any geometric distortion can almost be eliminated . &quot;
&quot; general : this value controls the strength of distortion of the second degree . with negative values , ton@@ ne distor@@ tions can be corrected and positive values are distortion @-@ shaped distortion . &quot;
&quot; corner : this value controls the thickness of the distortion fourth . this value acts more strongly at the edges than in the middle of the picture . for most lenses , the &apos; Corner parameter has the inver@@ ted in@@ signia of the parameter General . &quot;
&quot; zoom : this value scales the image size , thereby exec@@ uting a correction of the first graph . negative values increase while positive the image shr@@ inks . &quot;
brigh@@ ten : this value contrasts the brightness in the corners of the image . negative values decrease the brightness of the image in the corners while positive values increase it .
&quot; to help you find the best filter settings , the dialog provides a preview of distortion correction . the values you use for your image are saved and used as default values at the next start . &quot;
&quot; the ton@@ ne or cushion @-@ shaped correction should be performed before all cutting or size changes . if you cut a picture new and then perform a ton @-@ shaped correction , the effect would be obvious to the wrong . &quot;
&quot; to help you find the best correction , this tool provides you with a vertical and a horizontal relief line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to indicate the dotted lines . move it to an important place , such as the sea side or a building wall , in your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines at this point . &quot;
&quot; if you correct a cushion distortion , the resulting image will have black corners . you can remove these with the cutting tool in the Edit Custom menu or over the Zoom slider of this dialog . &quot;
&quot; the next logical step for some motives like images from the front , frame and paintings is to correct the perspective so that all angles in the picture have 90 degrees . note that if you hold the camera by hand you will always have a slight distortion of the perspective . &quot;
this is an example of the ton @-@ shaped correction applied to a church in Norway . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the corrected picture under ( 2 ) .
&quot; the algorithm is based on a method for simul@@ ating the infr@@ a @-@ red film of the G@@ enn@@ Gur@@ u.@@ org website that is available under this URL . the filter re@@ produces the well @-@ known SF@@ X@@ 200 I@@ infrared film , see this URL . this film has a sensitivity range of 200 @-@ 800 ISO . &quot;
&quot; in the left side of the window , you can select the area for preview . if you move the red rect@@ angle with the mouse you can view the effect on different parts of the picture . &quot;
below the preview you can set two parameters to adjust film gran@@ ul@@ arity and film sensitivity ( ISO ) . activate the option Fun@@ ge film gran@@ ulation if you want to simulate the gran@@ ular texture of a highly sensitive film . the ISO controller changes the amount of film gran@@ ulation and the domin@@ ance of the color green ( chlor@@ ophy@@ ll in nature ) in transformation . green meadows are white like snow !
&quot; since the filter mixes color channels to reproduce the infrared film , especially the green channel makes no sense to apply the effect on black / white photographs , as the color information is missing . &quot;
this is an example of the infrared filter effect applied to a landscape photo from New Zealand . the original image is shown below ( 1 ) and the edited image below ( 2 ) . the sensitivity of the film was set to ISO 400 . higher ISO values generate a kind of aura in the spot@@ lights .
&quot; this is known from classic high @-@ speed films , such as the B / W Ko@@ da@@ k Tr@@ i @-@ X . to increase the sensitivity of the films , manufacturers mix large silver grains of the photo emul@@ sion . &quot;
&quot; the film gran@@ ulation effect gives your photo a certain mood or seems to shift back into the past . the treated picture gets rid of a timeless atmosphere loos@@ ened from everyday life . if you want to use this special , gallery @-@ like , street photographic , gra@@ iny vision especially in your mon@@ ochro@@ me photos , you must use this filter . &quot;
&quot; with the controller , the ISO sensitivity can be calibr@@ ated to control the intensity and gran@@ ul@@ arity of the grains . the default value is , although often higher values are required , on ISO 24@@ 00 . if you need even more grains , you can apply the filter several times . &quot;
this is an example of the film gran@@ ulation effect applied to a black / white image . the original image is the ( 1 ) and this worked the ( 2 ) . the used film sensitivity is ISO @-@ 1600 .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter oil painting generates the appearance of an oil painting . it uses an copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
the &amp; digi@@ code ; filter oil painting gives your digital pictures a nice look like an oil painting . nature pictures and still life are good for this effect .
&quot; there are two kno@@ bs to influence this effect . the upper sel@@ ects the brush size between one and five . thicker brushes are better for large images . smooth@@ ed the smooth@@ ness or , from the other side , the hin@@ ge . &quot;
this is an example of the oil painting effect . the original picture is marked with the ( 1 ) and the editing is marked with the ( 2 ) . brush size for this 6@@ 40 pixel size image is 1 and smooth@@ ed 17 .
the lines that define the outline in drawing are highlighted . images whose gra@@ dients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect . it is helpful if you imagine what scene you have chosen to outline you . this would be good pictures to begin with .
there are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect . the upper knob sel@@ ects the pin size and the lower knob contrasts the contrast ( smooth ) .
this is an example of the carbon capture filter . the original image ( 1 ) and the changed image ( 2 ) . the default settings of 30 and 10 were used . the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value .
&quot; the digi@@ code ; filter en@@ grav@@ ings shapes your picture in 3 @-@ D , as if it was st@@ amped in wax . it uses a copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the digi@@ code ; filter engraving is a fast tool to restore your images with a 3 @-@ D effect . it works particularly well with images with a simple structure , where color is not the most important in the content . the filter uses the differences between color and intensity to transform the image into a gray , mon@@ dar@@ ed landscape . &quot;
&quot; the depth allows to adjust the contrast of filtering . a value of 30 , equal to 10 % , is the default setting . &quot;
this is an example of the engraving filter . the original ( 1 ) and the processed image ( 2 ) . the used depth is 10 % .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by distor@@ ting effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
wave blocks 1 : divide the image into cells and make it look as if it is considered by glass blocks .
wave blocks 2 : similar to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks .
some effects need a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load . you can cancel these effects anytime with the button Finish .
with this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blur@@ ring effects . it uses copy@@ righ@@ ted algorithms from Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
zoom blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image along star @-@ shaped lines that eman@@ ate from one point . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a zo@@ oming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography .
radi@@ al blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by turning the pixels around a center . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a rotating camera .
distance blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image to create the effect of a non @-@ focused camera lens . the object appears to appear in the background .
&quot; blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image by horizontal movements of pixels . this simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of a linear moving , z : B : from a car or train , camera . &quot;
&quot; blur@@ ring blur@@ ring : blur@@ ring the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones . this creates photos with a dre@@ amy and shiny soft focus effect ( Hamilton effect ) . this is ideal for creating romantic portraits , glam@@ our photos or adding a warm and subtle glow . &quot;
Sch@@ üt@@ tel@@ no sharp@@ ness : blur@@ ring the image by means of random shifting of pixels and thereby simul@@ ates the blur@@ ring of an arbitrary moving camera .
intelligent bl@@ ur : finds the color basin in the picture and wi@@ pes it without changing the rest .
&quot; mos@@ aic : spl@@ its the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it , through the filling with an average pixel value , new . &quot;
some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load .
ra@@ ind@@ rops are a nice little tool to make ra@@ ind@@ rops on your picture . this gives natural light@@ ness to your images . it uses a protected algorithm by Pi@@ eter Vol@@ os@@ hy@@ n .
drop@@ let size allows to change the size of drops . as the drop@@ let size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images .
&quot; use the selection tool to select the area , e.g. a face that should remain free . if you start the filter ra@@ ind@@ rops , the area will remain free of ra@@ ind@@ rops . &quot;
this is an example of the ra@@ ind@@ rops Fil@@ ters . the original picture ( 1 ) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image ( 2 ) indicates a sunset after a storm . the default values were used for this example .
&quot; if the photo has the wrong orientation , you can bring it into the correct orientation by mirr@@ oring or turning . &quot;
photo @-@ bli@@ sters is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality .
&quot; the big question is , how can you infl@@ ate a picture and keep the details sharp ? how can you zoom into a picture once the limits of the resolution are reached ? how can you find the missing information again or guess ? the C@@ Im@@ g algorithm used here makes a good job . try it and you will see it yourself . &quot;
&quot; if a photo has the wrong size , you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size . choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values . &quot;
&quot; the tool for size modi@@ fies a linear inter@@ pol@@ ation method to approximate the pixels . if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality , then try the tool to infl@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; many picture editing programs use a kind of inter@@ pol@@ ation , e.g. sp@@ line inter@@ pol@@ ation to enlarge a picture . &amp; digi@@ cam ; uses a further developed approach . the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the I@@ MA@@ GE team of the Gre@@ c CN@@ RS labs in Ca@@ en / France and is part of the C@@ Im@@ g project . &quot;
you have to tell the tool how you want to change the size . these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below :
&quot; maintain page ratio : if this setting is enabled , the page ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size . &quot;
&quot; regul@@ arity : &#91; 0 , 100 &#93; : this parameter concerns larger structures . the higher this value is set , the more it is smooth@@ ed . this is necessary when there is a lot of noise , since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture . even if you want to create a &apos; van Go@@ gh &apos; turbul@@ ence effect , it must be set higher than 3 . &quot;
&quot; the Save As and Lo@@ ads buttons are used exactly for this . enlarge En@@ tran@@ ing any st@@ alls for photo can be saved as text file , and later re@@ charged . &quot;
&quot; blowing photo is very fast in what makes it , but it can take a very long time and drag a high CPU load . you can cancel the calculation at any time using the button Finish . &quot;
the original is ( 1 ) and the enlarged picture ( 3 ) . the preview ( 2 ) is the result of the linear magni@@ fication for comparison .
&quot; cutting a photo is not just a frequently performed operation , but also a frequently under@@ estimated tool to create a picture . image editing allows this very easy . to cut a photo you just need to create a rect@@ angle with the mouse , by pressing the mouse button and dra@@ gging the rect@@ angle , then you will see this rect@@ angle then while you move the mouse . &quot;
&quot; you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rect@@ angle , creating a new rect@@ angle by simply pulling it with the left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the cut , use the button &quot; &quot; The C@@ trl + + X &quot; &quot; button in the tool@@ bar and the photo is cut ( C@@ trl ; + X ) . use the entries File Save or File Save as in the File menu to save the newly @-@ cut photo . &quot;
&quot; in the preview area , you can change the size of the rect@@ angle by moving the corners with the mouse . the aspect ratio that you defined in the dialog stays with it . &quot;
&quot; in the tool Fol@@ low aspect ratio , you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format . in portrait mode , the greater value of the height and the trans@@ verse format of the width is assigned . &quot;
&quot; the tool Fol@@ low aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio . this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use cen@@ timeter , inches or any other physical size . you can , for example , see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio . &quot;
&quot; at the right end of the dialog , two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizont@@ ally or vertically . &quot;
&quot; in the bottom of the dialog you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible , depending on the chosen ratio and orientation . &quot;
&quot; the tool Fol@@ low aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation ( Horiz@@ on@@ tal or Ver@@ tical ) . if you use the cutting tool next time , these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation . the modified image dimensions are stored in the EX@@ IF data , so that the EX@@ IF data reflect the cut image and not the original image . &quot;
&quot; the setup aid settings allow you to hide Help , so that you can better assemble your pictures . these aids are : &quot;
&quot; harmonic triangle : harmonic divi@@ den@@ ds are based on the principle of simil@@ arity . like the third el@@ bow , harmonic tri@@ angles are a possibility to divide a rect@@ angle into similarly harmonic tri@@ angles aligned on the diag@@ onal . &quot;
&quot; golden mean : the golden center is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns , such as the spir@@ als of a Nau@@ til@@ us pussy or the flower leaves of a sun@@ flower . it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful . &quot;
&quot; the golden partition is the irr@@ ational number 1,@@ 6@@ 180@@ 33@@ 9@@ 88 ... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to create your temples and pyrami@@ ds . artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures , buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty . &quot;
&quot; the number is derived from Fi@@ bon@@ acc@@ i sequence 1 , 1 , 2 , 3 , 5 , 8 , 13 , 21 , 34 &amp; etc . the resulting divi@@ der is 1 : 1.@@ 6@@ 18 the golden mean . &quot;
the golden center provides smo@@ other relief lines if you put a picture together . these aids are listed below :
&quot; the Golden Spir@@ ale will bring you good results for your photos . compared to the third el@@ bow , the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image . this kind of composition takes the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmet@@ ric visual flow in this way . &quot;
&quot; a further rule is called the rec@@ tan@@ gles of the golden spiral , also called golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . these rec@@ tan@@ gles are used to create the golden spiral . &quot;
&quot; the golden tri@@ angles also derive from the above @-@ discussed golden spiral . their verti@@ ces are the center points of the sides of the golden rec@@ tan@@ gles . note that , in contrast to harmonious tri@@ angles , golden tri@@ angles are not equal tri@@ angles . diag@@ on@@ als on these lines can cause a static object to appear more dynamic . &quot;
&quot; if you use golden tri@@ angles to break your frame , create an effect that is called dynamic symmet@@ ry by professional photographers . try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the tri@@ angles . the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise . &quot;
the Options Horiz@@ on@@ tal mirror and mirror vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divi@@ der .
&quot; with the button color you can set the color of the guides . if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast , the guides can be invisible . in this way , you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image . &quot;
the free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle .
&quot; if you make a photo , it easily happens that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizont@@ ally . this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle . you can do this by editing free rotation and adjust the target angle . &quot;
rotate your image with the slider angle . the values on this slider are in degrees . with the Pre@@ ferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees . a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window . the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right .
&quot; for your help , the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line . move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines . after moving it over an important point of the image , you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button . now adjust the angle as described in previous section . &quot;
after you have turned a picture you will find unwanted tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to repair it is to use the function Trans@@ forming cut out of the image processing .
an elegant way to cut the image is the Automatic Cut . select one of the following options :
&quot; the Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing option smooth@@ es the image a bit after the turn . however , note the above warning . &quot;
all perspective transform@@ ations are performed around a fixed point of the so @-@ called reference point . this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle .
to change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image . the preview will then be automatically rec@@ al@@ cul@@ ated . on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective :
&quot; new width : displays the width of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
&quot; new height : displays the height of the new image , including empty areas created by the transformation , in pixels . &quot;
angle to the left : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : indicates the current angle in degrees at the upper right corner of the transformed area .
angle to the left : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom left corner of the transformed area .
angle to the right : shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area .
&quot; after adjusting the perspective , the image becomes a little blur@@ red . for a single adjustment , this effect is small , but two adap@@ tations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible . &quot;
&quot; after you have adjusted the perspective , you get unpleasant tri@@ angular holes at the corners . one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformation cutting from the image editing . &quot;
&quot; a horizontal she@@ ar , for example , will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left . this is not rotation , the picture is distorted . &quot;
&quot; rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle . you can she@@ ar horizont@@ ally and vertically at the same time . if you press pres@@ ets , the angle will be reset to zero . a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumb@@ nail . &quot;
&quot; move your mouse to an important point , such as the lake , a wall of a building on your image and press the left mouse button to fix the lines . you can now use the tool to adjust your image . &quot;
&quot; for a single sh@@ ear@@ ing this effect is usually neg@@ li@@ gible , but two shots produce twice as much blur@@ ring and therefore you should avoid this . &quot;
&quot; after the sc@@ aling , the image has tri@@ angular holes in the corners . one way to eliminate them is to cut the picture with transformation cut out of the image processing . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats . the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and , in some cases , of the way these libraries have been compiled . in most distri@@ butions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats . &quot;
&quot; because of this dependence on other libraries , it is impossible to give a list of all file formats available on their system at this point . however , you will always find JPEG and TI@@ FF among them . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ cam ; shows only files in formats to know . this happens on the basis of the file extension and a comparison of this with a pre @-@ defined list . if the extension is listed in the list , change the file in the image processing . &quot;
almost all digital cameras store photos in one of two formats : JPEG or TI@@ FF . some cameras even allow you to select the format you want to use . a more detailed description of these file formats can be found in Wikipedia . &amp; digi@@ cam ; supports both formats .
image compression is the application of data compression techniques to digital images . redundant information is reduced to save image data to a more efficient way .
&quot; JPEG 2000 is also supported . generally , there are better , smo@@ other results than JPEG in the same compression ratio . the 2000 version can also store los@@ s@@ less if specified in the settings . &quot;
&quot; if you want to learn more about the raw format , you can read very helpful instructions in English from Wikipedia , The L@@ umin@@ ous Land@@ scape and Cambridge in Colour . you can convert raw format images to JPEG or TI@@ FF with the raw image converter from &amp; digi@@ kam . in the Con@@ figuration section you will find further information on how to use modules with &amp; digi@@ kam . &quot;
&quot; &amp; digi@@ kam ; supports the loading of raw images only with the program d@@ cra@@ w which is contained in &amp; digi@@ kam , which contains more than 200 raw data formats . all support cameras can be seen below on the web page of Dave &apos;s Coff@@ in . the table below shows a short list of raw formats which are supported by &amp; digi@@ kam ; &quot;
&quot; many digital cameras support the recording of short films . these clips are often stored in the A@@ VI@@ - or MPEG format . &amp; digi@@ cam ; however , is not a film editing software and therefore has no built @-@ in possibilities to view or edit movies ; when you click on a movie file , the &amp; k@@ de ; use settings to play movies to start playing . &quot;

many tools you need to edit the photo editing are in &amp; edited ; your description will follow here .
&quot; all image editing tools such as sharpen@@ ing , sof@@ ten@@ ers , noise suppression , re@@ focus , mas@@ king , &amp; etc ; . use a uniform dialog type that shows the effect in a preview before the filter is applied to the current image . below you see &amp; quot ; texture applying &quot; ; in this dialog : &quot;
( 1 ) : this progress bar shows the status of the filter on the current image . to the left of it five buttons allow to change the comparison mode of the preview area . these modes are :
vertical parts without dup@@ licate . the left pane shows the original and the right shows the filter applied to the area on the right of the selected preview area .
horizont@@ ally divide without dup@@ licate . the upper area shows the original and the lower one shows the filter applied to the area below the selected preview area .
vertical divide . the left pane shows the original and the right to compare the effect of the filter .
horizont@@ ally divide . the upper area shows the original and the lower to compare the effect of the filter .
&quot; mouse over &apos; -@@ Style : displays the preview when the mouse is not in the preview area , otherwise the original . &quot;
( 2 ) : there are two buttons that you can switch on to show over and under exposure . the colors used can be adjusted in the general settings page .
( 3 ) : the frame for selecting the preview . you can drag this frame with the mouse inside the image and place it on the part of the image from which you want to preview the preview . the preview in the left part of the dialog will be updated immediately .
( 5 ) : in the lower left corner : here is a help and the possibility to reset all buttons to your default values . all settings from the last use of the module are noted .
the side bar features the essential information about the selected image and is largely self explan@@ atory . it is grouped in the following sections :
photo properties : displays a summary of the most important parameters when shooting the photo . these data are from the EX@@ IF data when they are available .
this tab provides an intuitive map search tool based on the Mar@@ ble Mini@@ program . you can move in or out with the mouse wheel or hold it down and move it . move it while you press the left mouse button . click C@@ trl ; left mouse button to open a square . all images within these coordinates are filtered and displayed . this naturally pres@@ upp@@ oses your images ge@@ o @-@ data .
&amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; is an editor for pal@@ ettes files . the application can be used to edit color pal@@ ettes and for selecting and nam@@ ing colors .
&quot; in the latter case , they are in your personal folder for &amp; k@@ de ; settings and hot user @-@ defined color and last used colors . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog palette , you can select from a list of installed pallets or browse the folders for files . &quot;
the cursor is displayed as a line in the palette view . it can be moved by clicking on the area next to a color .
the color is described below the palette . here also the color name can be changed .
&quot; to create such a selection , click on the area next to a color to move the cursor there . then move the mouse with pressed left mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is activated under the button color , the color is inserted from the color table on the cursor . the color is inserted either inserted or over@@ writes another ; depending on whether the mode is selected over@@ write . this mode can be set by selecting the over@@ write button under the cursor cursor . &quot;
&quot; a selection that was created as described in the last section can be used together with the actions to copy , cut and paste . &quot;
&quot; color@@ edit ; uses the following format for data in the clip@@ board : for each color three values for the proportions of red , green and blue and an optional color name followed by a new@@ line character if another color follows . if there are three numbers in the clip@@ board , these can be inserted as a color in &amp; k@@ color@@ edit ; &quot;
the colors in the palette and the output of the color selection can be dra@@ gged with the mouse .

&quot; after you have selected one or more dot files , the main window looks like in the lower screen shot : &quot;
&quot; as you can see , an overview is displayed in the corner when the graph is larger than the canvas . you can select a fixed position of this overview with the context menu or select this position automatically . &quot;
&quot; use the mouse wheel ( high and down without special buttons , left and right with pressed &amp; Alt ; button ) ; &quot;
zo@@ oming is limited in both directions by factor 10 . below you see the maximum reduction of a graph .
&quot; if the file currently has been modified by another program , the following window will be displayed : &quot;
&quot; you can choose whether the graph should be re@@ charged , or if you want to ignore the change . &quot;
&quot; when you open a graph file outside of a running &amp; cli@@ ck@@ viewer ; -@@ instance open , &amp; eg ; in the file browser or on the command line , you have the option to open a new &amp; cli@@ ck@@ viewer ; instance , or to display the graph to be loaded in a sub@@ window of the already running instance . &quot;
&quot; as with the last option , you can save your choice permanently , but also change it with the setup dialog afterwards . &quot;
&quot; when you start the program , you can open all the graphs of your last session . again , you can save your choice as well as change later . &quot;
you can also specify how to split the graph to several pages . the number of horizontal and vertical pages can be selected freely .
&quot; if you use multiple pages , you can choose whether the parts of the graph that come on a page should be adjusted to this page . if you keep the aspect ratio , the pages may not be filled by the respective parts of the graph . &quot;
page preview with a string distributed across multiple pages without head@@ line and with another font
&quot; the Renew@@ able Lo@@ ad page gives the ability to specify behavior when a file has been modified on hard disk , eg ; from another program . you can set a default behavior ( automatically rel@@ o@@ ad or ignore the changes ) or ask the program each time . &quot;
&quot; the opening page gives the possibility to specify the behavior of a graph viewer ; you can set a default behavior for this case ( open the graph in a new window or in a sub@@ window of the already running session ) , or specify that each time you are asked . &quot;
the session management page gives the possibility to specify the starting behavior of the last session ( open the files of the last session or not ) or decide to be asked at each start .
&quot; the context menu , which normally appears at one click in the main window with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , opens up further possibilities : &quot;
here you can select among different &amp; graph vi@@ z ; layout algorithms . the entries as described on the website of &amp; graph@@ vi@@ z are :
&quot; the algorithm lays the edges in the same direction ( from top to bottom or from left to right ) , and then attempts to produce as short edges and as few edge overl@@ app@@ ings as possible . &quot;
the &amp; ne@@ ato ; algorithm is the standard for ung@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ ene . it produces representations according to the spring@@ board model . the Kam@@ ada @-@ Ka@@ wa@@ i algorithm is used that is syn@@ onymous with statistical multi@@ dimensional sc@@ aling .
&quot; the &amp; f@@ d@@ p ; algorithm produces a spring model layout for ung@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ ene . it uses the Fru@@ it@@ man @-@ Rein@@ gold he@@ ur@@ istics , and includes a multi @-@ grid sol@@ ver for the treatment of large and clu@@ stered graph@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Cir@@ co ; algorithm arran@@ ges the no@@ des circul@@ arly in accordance with the description of Six und Tol@@ lis , 1999 , and K@@ auff@@ man and meadow , 2002 . it is useful for certain diagrams of multiple cycli@@ cal structures . &quot;
&quot; open a dialog where you can specify a layout command that will then be executed by a shell . the command should accept the graph file as a parameter , and the calculated layout of the graph to st@@ d@@ out in x@@ dot format . with such a layout command , you can set the graph with a filter before it is drawn . &quot;
&quot; speci@@ fies the type of graph ( directed or ung@@ eri@@ enced ) and applies the standard algorithm for the respective type ( dot ; for directional , &amp; ne@@ ato ; for ung@@ eri@@ ed graph@@ ene ) . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is enabled , the overview will be displayed if necessary . otherwise it will not appear and the positioning menu is in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; display the What is the -@@ mouse poin@@ ter . with this mouse @-@ cursor , click on a &amp; GUI ; -@@ element to get more help to this item ( if any ) . &quot;
a list of changes is available at this address and in the file Ch@@ ange@@ Log in the base folder of the source repository .
&quot; &amp; k@@ graph@@ viewer ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program , which uses the &amp; graph vi@@ z ; -@@ tools for representation . it requires the following program packages : &quot;
a special setup is not necessary to use &amp; cli@@ ck@@ viewer ; in the Settings menu you will find more options .
&quot; the main window of the symbol editor is divided into five sections : the main tool@@ bar , the bar for drawing tools , the status bar , the .@@ color palette and the grid in which you draw the symbol . &quot;
&quot; when the current file has been changed , you will be asked if you want to save the changes . &quot;
&quot; restore the last revers@@ ed step . if you do not have a step backwards , this feature is disabled . &quot;
insert the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
sets the current symbol in grey levels . this can create colors that do not match with those of the symbol palette of &amp; k@@ de ;
&quot; does not change the symbol , but sets the current character color to the color of the dot on which you click . &quot;
&quot; the status bar shows you the current actions . from left to right , it shows you the x@@ - and y @-@ coordinates of the current pixel , the size of the current canvas , the magni@@ fication factor and the current number of colors of the symbol . &quot;
insert the clip@@ board content as a new image ( if the clip@@ board contains a symbol ) .
&quot; open with Settings &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; set up a dialog with the three pages templates for symbols , background and tool@@ bars . &quot;

&quot; choose Transpar@@ ent Pixel or view Lin@@ e@@ ale and display one colored : or a ch@@ ess@@ board as a transparency display . you can also select the size : the car@@ os on small , medium and large as well as the color 1 : and color 2 : select . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module provides tools to read and save new images .
&quot; this module can be used to read and store new images from external sources . at present , two sources can be used : &quot;
scan pictures : use the K@@ oo@@ ka interface to read images from a scanner supported by the San@@ e project or another source such as Video Stre@@ ams . to do this you need to have K@@ oo@@ ka and San@@ e installed .
&quot; when you scan the menu entry , a dialog appears , which lets you select between all available sources on your computer . select the source from which you want to fetch the image . you can also set the default source for the next time . &quot;
&quot; after that , the K@@ oo@@ ka window appears by selecting the default duc@@ r@@ he &apos;s own to select your image accordingly . view the preview and adjust the range to your needs before you click the button to view the image . the estimated file size will be displayed in the right lower corner . in the K@@ oo@@ ka manual you will find more information . &quot;
&quot; make sure that the window will be displayed completely , as some settings might not be displayed . &quot;
&quot; after pressing the scan button , you need to wait until the scan is completed and the window to set the options of the target image appears . here you can specify the compression and type of the image file . please remember that the type BM@@ P does not comp@@ ress and therefore creates very large files . you also need to select or create the folder and create the image . &quot;
you can create screen@@ shots after you have selected in the Import &gt; Screen Sa@@ ver menu . a window appears in which you can set the different screen phot@@ om@@ o@@ des :
select the complete desktop to read a single window under the mouse .
&quot; if all your own program window is selected , the calling program will disappear , so you can view other screens and windows . otherwise , after a short delay , read the currently visible workplace . if you have picked up the complete desktop , only the window under the mouse is read . &quot;
&quot; the delay determines how long screen shot will wait before it starts . if you need to switch to other working areas , you should select this delay high enough to have the time to navigate there . &quot;
&quot; after the screen@@ shot is made , the dialog appears options of the target image with the options already described above . &quot;

the K@@ IP@@ I @-@ module for geographic loc@@ alization allows to add and edit GPS coordinates in the metadata of an image and the geographical data is stored in the EX@@ IF @-@ keywords of the image and the loc@@ alization can be displayed in a map in an external browser .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module for geographic loc@@ alization provides tools for loc@@ ating images ge@@ ographi@@ cally in the spher@@ ical coordinate system used by GPS and Galil@@ eo . height , length and l@@ atitude are used . &quot;
to cor@@ relate your images with geographic data you need a GPS track as an XML file in the GP@@ X format . g@@ ps@@ ba@@ bel and g@@ ps@@ one can download and convert the data for you from your GPS device .
image Ge@@ ographical loc@@ alization cor@@ relative . this interface can merge a number of previously selected images with a GPS track .
&quot; select the images you want to cor@@ relate in the main window and go to the menu . the dialog above appears to load a trace file with GP@@ X file . of course , this file contains data that were recorded at the same locations as the images of your camera . &quot;
&quot; when the file is loaded an automatic correlation is carried out , which shows the coordinates in red . GPS Sp@@ ur@@ data are recorded in GMT time and therefore the camera status must be converted to GMT . this can be done with the time zone . place your camera zone here . &quot;
&quot; the setting for the maximum time deviation indicates the upper deviation for the GPS time and camera angle . if the deviation is below , the data is merged . the maximum value for this is 2000 seconds . &quot;
if you have no trace data from a location for images you can manually edit the GP@@ X file and add to the images . the time difference of 2000 seconds will cor@@ relate all the images in this area .
&quot; the options inter@@ pol@@ ate and difference in minutes can be used if you don &apos;t have any suitable data . if you know that in reality there is a location in a big time difference between camera and GPS , you can set these limits here and then press the button cor@@ relate to inter@@ pol@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; the coordinates can be set manually with this dialog . this is useful if you have made a number of photos at the same location . since the dialog opens the coordinates of one call to the next , you only have to use the OK button to set the data in the current photo . &quot;
&quot; the location can also be found and set with the displayed map . to do this , select the respective region and increase si@@ e.@@ Le@@ ave this again and again until you have reached a sufficient accuracy . the height must always be selected manually . the map can be changed between card mode , satellite image and a mixed mode . &quot;
&quot; completely outside the K@@ IP@@ I module , there are ways to attach the GPS data to the pictures . here is a small script that uses the exi@@ fting tool to provide a stack of pictures with GPS data . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module picture gallery is a tool to export a set of albums as HTML pages .
this module can export your albums to a picture gallery from HTML pages to version 4.@@ 01 . you can select the albums that are to be exported as HTML pages and specify the parameters for the HTML pages . the character set is enco@@ ded UT@@ F @-@ 8 to provide the best possible internation@@ alization .
the tab has four tab in which the settings can be adjusted . the tab selection allows you to select all albums that are to be exported to HTML . you can select these albums only . the three buttons on the right you can quickly select a large number of albums .
&quot; the tab Ap@@ pear@@ ance defines the general look and layout for each page . this tab is largely self explan@@ atory . the option for each image will create a page in which each image will also get its own page . if you then click on a picture , a new page will be opened in which the image is displayed . otherwise , the image will be displayed directly with your standard image viewer , &amp; eg ; Ku@@ ick@@ Show , &quot;
&quot; the Ri@@ der album defines the settings where and how the gallery should be stored with all your associated images . select a folder on which you have write permission . a sub@@ folder named K@@ IP@@ I@@ HTML@@ Export , which contains everything , will be created there . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected the JPEG file format , the EX@@ IF information of your original pictures will also be stored in the new images . &quot;
&quot; you can change the default color depth with other color depth . of course , it also influences the file size . all other settings are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; the tab thumb@@ nails will allow you to adjust some of the settings from the album tab for thumb@@ nails , that are small images that are displayed in the gallery . &quot;
a progress window shows the user how far the action is . press Canc@@ el to cancel the process .
&quot; if the module has created the pages , the window will not be closed automatically . therefore , you can read the program messages to see if errors occurred while creating . the web browser is automatically started in order to preview the gallery . press Cl@@ ose to close the module . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I viewer is a very fast and flexible Open@@ GL based tool for viewing images .
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I viewer allows you to view a selection of images and perform basic operations such as rot@@ ations , zo@@ oming or shifting . &quot;
&quot; after the start , an image is displayed in full screen mode by default . this can be changed to a window mode . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I JPEG Los@@ s@@ less module is a tool for modi@@ fying images without compromising your quality .
&quot; this module allows for the actions listed below to save images in JPEG format , without the usual loss of quality or metadata . &quot;
&quot; the consequence of loss @-@ free storage is that the file size increases , because no compression of the color information takes place . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I digital camera module is a tool to connect your computer with a digital camera .
the K@@ IP@@ I module digital camera client currently has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. warning : the participants of this list speak English .
the K@@ IP@@ I module metadata editor now has no documentation . if you want to change this situation please contact the k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .org of the K@@ IP@@ I team .
&quot; with the import function of the metadata module you can copy data from one image to another . to do so , select the image you want to copy in the main program and then click the Import function . this will open the file selection dialog with which you want to copy the target image , i.e. the image to which you want to copy the metadata . &quot;
&quot; this function does not work with all image formats . you can copy from anywhere , but not write into any target format . JPEG is supported when writing . please look at exi@@ v2 to see which formats are supported . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I MPEG enco@@ der module is a tool to convert a number of images to a MPEG video in the form of a slide show .
&quot; the MPEG enco@@ der module can be used to convert selected images to a MPEG video , with a defined length . this module uses the packages M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck . &quot;
&quot; all images are automatically sc@@ aled to the correct size for the selected video format . additionally , you can select a background color for the slide show . with this module it is possible to create the formats DVD / X@@ V@@ CD / SV@@ CD / V@@ CD for your DVD player . to burn the medium you can finally use the K@@ 3@@ b program . &quot;
you must first select the images that are to be packed into the MPEG slide show . after that you can start creating the module via Tools MPEG Di@@ ash@@ au .
&quot; the images you have selected are then listed under image files in the portfolio . there , you can also change sorting of the pictures or the contents of the list . &quot;
&quot; the video format can be selected from various formats , DVD , X@@ V@@ CD , SV@@ CD and V@@ CD . if you plan to play the file on a TV , you need to select the appropriate TV standard PAL , SE@@ CAM or NT@@ SC . PAL is default and most likely the right choice for Europe . &quot;
&quot; in the next step , you should specify the time in seconds that a picture is displayed . the speed of the image transition is fixed below . a low value creates very sudden , a high on the other hand very smooth picture change . &quot;
&quot; the background color can be set next . in doubt , you should leave it black . you can specify the name and path of the generated file using the name of the m@@ peg output file . &quot;
&quot; if you specify an audio file in the name of the audio source file , it will be integrated into the movie . after adjusting all settings to your wishes , you can start the creation of the movie with the Edit button . depending on the speed of your computer you can now quickly or calm@@ ly enjoy a coffee and enjoy the slide show if you are back . &quot;
&quot; if a critic appears that enco@@ ders or tools are missing , you can customize the paths to programs of the M@@ j@@ peg@@ Tools and Image@@ Magi@@ ck packages via the button Settings on the right bottom . &quot;
the print assist@@ ent allows to print several images on a sheet of paper together in standard photo sizes . the combined images can also be automatically opened with the image processing Gim@@ p . this is e.@@ g : useful to improve or print with the Gim@@ p module for direct printing .
&quot; with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can import / convert your images stored in RA@@ W format in one of three formats JPEG , TI@@ FF or P@@ PM . &quot;
conversion is based on the command line tool d@@ cra@@ w from Dave Coff@@ in . an original quote from Him is : do not expect from d@@ cra@@ w that it produces the same results as the software from your camera manufacturer . sometimes you get with d@@ cra@@ w better results ! .
&quot; first , select the RA@@ W file to be converted and start the module . the Ra@@ w image converter window will then appear in the mode for a single image . with the Pre@@ view button , you can view the effect of your current settings on the image . &quot;
&quot; you can now adjust the values to adjust the conversion process . the first option determines whether the camera settings should be used for the white balance . the key parameters such as g@@ amma , brightness and red / blue ampli@@ fiers can be adjusted . if the result is not optimal , you can edit the image later . &quot;
&quot; a four @-@ colour R@@ G@@ BG conversion can be chosen so that you can use the contrast information . if your camera works in RGB mode , the R@@ G@@ BG switch has no effect . &quot;
&quot; once you are satisfied with the preview , you can choose one of the three output formats and save the conversion result . the file name stays the same and only the extension is adjusted accordingly . JPEG uses a los@@ sy algorithm and produces the smallest file sizes . &quot;
&quot; the Tagged image format , TI@@ FF , keeps all information of your image and uses the los@@ s@@ less LZ@@ W compression . &quot;
&quot; if you intend to edit your images frequently or later , you should not choose the JPEG format , since it only allows a limited number of operations before the image quality deterior@@ ates . TI@@ FF and P@@ PM are better adapted to keep the original data . &quot;
&quot; if you choose JPEG as a storage format , the metadata that is contained in the RA@@ W file are stored in the JPEG file in the Ex@@ if information . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted your settings , you can start the conversion with the Run button . if you want to cancel this process again , you can use Canc@@ el Canc@@ el . &quot;
&quot; batch processing mode allows you to convert different images at one time . therefore , use this mode if you are sure , e.g. by testing on a single image , which are the best settings . &quot;
&quot; the available settings are almost identical to the version for single images . however , you have the possibility to over@@ write the existing file automatically . this is helpful if they were created in a previous attempt . however , a preview is not available . progress bar shows how far the conversion is advanced . &quot;
this module can be used to re@@ comp@@ ress all images in one album . it uses the program convert from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package . the following image formats are supported :
&quot; this module can be used to ren@@ ame all images of an album . you can set the pre@@ fix , the start number and the tim@@ est@@ amp of the album . &quot;
this module can be used to change the size of multiple images of an image collection . it uses the convert program from the Image@@ Magi@@ ck package .
proportional ( 1 D@@ im . ) : normal size change in one dimension . the width or height of the image is selected automatically depending on the image orientation . the aspect ratio remains unchanged .
proportional ( 2 D@@ im . ) : size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio remains unchanged . you can use this option for example to adjust your image to screen format .
not proportional : non @-@ proportional size change in two dimensions . the aspect ratio is changed at this option .
&quot; printing Pre@@ par@@ ation : prepares the image for photo printing . the user can adjust the print resolution and size of the photo paper . the target image , including background size , edge size and background color , is adjusted accordingly . &quot;
with this K@@ IP@@ I module you can send selected pictures with your preferred e @-@ mail program . it is also possible to change the size of the images to be sent before .
&quot; after you have started the module , the images -@@ window with the images you have selected will be displayed . click on the Add images button to add more images with a file selection dialog . for the last image selected , you will see a preview on the right . &quot;
you can also drag and drop images to the list of images to add to the list of images to send .
with the button images remove the selected images from the list of images to send .
after selecting all the pictures you can use the OK button to open the new message window of your e @-@ mail client . you just have to add the addresses and the subject . the pictures selected by you are attached as app@@ endi@@ x .
pay attention not to send too many pictures at once . most e @-@ mail accounts have restrictions on the size of e @-@ mails sent . it may be a good idea to send multiple mails if you want to send a lot of pictures .
the e @-@ mail window is used to change the settings for sending the images . your configuration is saved and used each time until you change them .
&quot; select your e @-@ mail client from the menu . if you select Thunder@@ bird , you must specify the right path for your installation in the input field below . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the Google Mail Service , you must first install the G@@ mail Agent on your computer . you can download it here . &quot;
&quot; after selecting comments in a attached file , the comments are added to the images in a text file and attached to the mail . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ NG format under the Image File Format menu is not very suitable to reduce the size of photo files , but it is best adapted among the los@@ s@@ less formats such as TI@@ FF . you should therefore use P@@ NG if you have a fast internet connection and the photo quality is not to be changed . otherwise we recommend the JPEG format . &quot;
&quot; if you select JPEG in image file format and the original files are in JPEG format , then the original export data will be added to the sending images . &quot;
&quot; if the process is finished , the window will not automatically shut down so you can view the status messages , in search of errors . your e @-@ mail program will be automatically started at the end . &quot;
&quot; after starting the Advanced Di@@ ash@@ au module , a window with questions like you want to show your slide show will be displayed . you can choose between the selected and all images of the album . &quot;
&quot; the option Open@@ GL transitions in the presentation also activ@@ ates very elegant image transitions by Open@@ GL . however , you have to have a corresponding graphic card , otherwise the slide show will be very slow . &quot;
the file name option shows that the fil@@ en@@ ame of the images is displayed in the lower left corner during the presentation .
the option loop ensures that the presentation will be displayed in an infinite loop . you can then cancel it manually with Es@@ c .
the option images random@@ ly select makes sure the images are displayed in a random order . so it is not the order of the images used in the album .
&quot; the time distance between the images can be set in delay between the images . 1500 mill@@ is@@ ec@@ onds meet 1.5 seconds and are a good standard value . however , the best distance depends on your computer and the chosen transition effect . &quot;
there are more than a dozen transition effects between which you can choose . by chance every transition between the images chooses a different effect .
&quot; during the slide show , you can access a tool@@ bar at the top left edge of the screen . move the mouse to this corner to switch it on . &quot;
&quot; with this tool@@ bar you can stop the presentation and start again , jump to the previous and the next picture and stop the slide show . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the screen you can see the current fil@@ en@@ ame , the position of the current image and the total number of images in your presentation . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ IP@@ I module Time &amp; Date now has no documentation . if you are interested in writing this , please contact the mailing list of the K@@ IP@@ I team under k@@ de @-@ imaging @ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. warning : the participants of this list speak English . &quot;
the K@@ IP@@ I module background image is a tool for setting a picture as a background image for the working surface .
&quot; this module uses the currently selected image , depending on the selected option of the sub@@ menu , as background for your K@@ DE desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you have ann@@ ot@@ ated your images and videos with ann@@ ot@@ ations , you can browse through them , see image . as you can see through a comparison with the image , entries are now available in each group , i.e. persons , locations and in group keywords . &quot;
&quot; in the browser window , you can view the categories for which you have entered information when you have provided your images and videos with comments . in addition , there are entries to look for EX@@ IF @-@ based information to view the folder structure on your hard disk and of course view the current thumb@@ nails . &quot;
&quot; if you press the mouse on the entry , the browser view changes . see picture . &quot;
this selection method allows you to restrict the number of images displayed from a few thousand images to a few single images .
&quot; if you have selected all the people , locations and other settings , you can view thumb@@ nails to view the images of your activity area . &quot;
&quot; in the picture , each person has the same symbol in front of her name . you can use it with a photo@@ album ; however , for each person you can save your own thumb@@ nail , This also applies to places , keywords and other categories you have defined yourself . see the picture below . &quot;
&quot; to view images next to the name , select the button which is located on the right outside on the tool@@ bar . in the pop @-@ up context menu you can select which view you want to use for the current category . this has the advantage that you can display the view for each category separately ( if you don &apos;t have any suitable images for your keywords ) . &quot;
&quot; however , you have to decide for yourself which image should be displayed for each individual person . in order to do this , you will need to open the image display window ( described in more detail ) and select the image for the respective person in the context menu . in the check window , you can customize the magni@@ fying factor according to your wishes and select which part of the image to be displayed or cut off . &quot;
&quot; when you visit the Search entry in the main window , you will see a dialog that is very similar to the dialog for setting the image properties . &quot;
&quot; if you enter a string in the let@@ tering or description field , the cap@@ tions or descriptions of the images are searched for this text . if you want , you can also enter a date to search for ; the date can be either a part of the total file , i.e. , for example 1971 , or the complete date . you can also use a range of two data , such as 1971 @-@ 1980 . &quot;
&quot; with the options in the lower part of the window , you can browse all the pictures according to certain names , as you can see in the picture . click here for pictures on which Jes@@ per , but not Anne Hel@@ ene are depicted . &quot;
&quot; this is the user manual for a photo@@ album ; if you don &apos;t like reading manuals , but prefer to try out the same functions , you have the following alternatives to this manual : &quot;
&quot; go to the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and take a look at the quick entry , the screen@@ shots and the introduction videos . &quot;
&quot; start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and in the first dialog select the demo , if you start &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; start the first time , or select from the menu Help the menu entry k@@ photo@@ album ; demo . as a result , some sample images will be loaded and you can test the features of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; try . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to print this manual , you can find it on the homepage of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as a coherent HTML document to download . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the main window from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; see the tim@@ eline . a picture of this bar can be seen here : . as the name says , this bar displays data statistics on the images in your database . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can display several different time units . each bar displays another unit . you can switch between the units for years , months , weeks , hours and 10 minutes . &quot;
&quot; the tim@@ eline can be inter@@ actively used in the following ways : you can change the displayed preview view from the database ( when you select a date , the first image of this date will appear in the preview window ) and the tim@@ eline always displays the current date of the currently displayed images when you navigate to the preview view . &quot;
&quot; you can also select a range of tim@@ eline by holding down the mouse button and drag the mouse over the ruler of the tim@@ eline , i.e. the time data . if you select a range , you can cancel the selection by clicking on a bar of the tim@@ eline . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; provides you two ways to create HTML pages with your images . one is integrated in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated and the other available as module ( see ) . in the following part of the user manual , the one is described in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; integrated version that you can create through the menu file ... &quot;
&quot; before creating HTML pages you need to make some adjustments . these are divided into the three areas Content , Layout and Obj@@ ective . in the following , each section is described more precisely . &quot;
&quot; first enter the title of the overview and a description that will contain the HTML file later . on k@@ photo@@ album , HTML sample pages see an example of these settings . &quot;
&quot; next , select whether a &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; -@@ export file should be created on the overview page . &quot;
&quot; finally , you can select which information is to be displayed on the HTML pages . this allows you to avoid that information is displayed that is obvious to the viewer without a description . for example , you can &apos;t use this setting to hide certain images from certain viewers . &quot;
&quot; in this area , you can specify how the HTML pages should look like . most settings are clear , which is why it is not addressed specifically . &quot;
&quot; at the bottom of the page you can set different resolutions for the images . this means that those who look at your website and have a monitor that supports the maximum resolution 800@@ x@@ 600 , will not download any images that , for example , have a resolution of 16@@ 00@@ x@@ 1200 . &quot;
&quot; the viewer of your site may change the resolution at any time you specified . so he can search your images with low resolution , leading to a lower transmission time . if he wants to get an image bigger , he changes to a higher resolution . &quot;
&quot; in this setting , you specify the different folders and the URL where your site is stored . &quot;
&quot; best , choose a base folder for all your HTML files and create a new sub@@ folder for each successive set . &quot;
&quot; first you need to select the root folder in which all your images are stored . this folder will be saved and added automatically next time . this will allow you to select the location for all future images . here , you can either select a folder or a protocol supported by K@@ DE , for example : &quot;
&quot; after you have created your images , you can check if they are all visible to the viewer . if you choose a URL for the base folder , a web browser after the pages have been created should be started . otherwise , the web browser will start in the wrong folder . &quot;
&quot; if the HTML files created by you are not yet in the final destination folder , you must manually copy them there . to enable the import function , see , correctly , you have to specify the final destination of the files . this is not the sub@@ folder of the current files , but the base folder in which all sub@@ folders are located . &quot;
&quot; the settings that are currently being set are related to all three root folders and URLs . in these , a sub@@ folder is created , whose name you specify in output folders . &quot;
&quot; if you are on a family celebration , a meeting in the company , a conference or somewhere else , with other users from &amp; co photo@@ album ; come together , you may want to create your pictures with these . &quot;
with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can export a copy of your images to a .@@ k@@ in file . these can import others into your database . the image properties are exported with ex@@ - and imported .
&quot; there are two different types of .@@ k@@ in files , internal and external . &quot;
&quot; you can either export a .@@ k@@ in file directly from the File menu ... or together with HTML pages , see , create . if you create a .@@ k@@ in file along with an HTML file , this will be an external .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; an external .@@ k@@ in file searches the images in two ways . first , it searches the images that are located in the folder of the .@@ k@@ in file . if the corresponding images are not found , the images of the URL you specified when creating the HTML files are searched . this is of course only possible if you have created your .@@ k@@ in file using the HTML export . &quot;
&quot; in the following , the dialog for ex@@ porting images is described , which you can view through the File menu ... &quot;
the most important option of this dialog is whether it should be internal or external .@@ k@@ in files . the following three choices are available :
&quot; in the Manu@@ ell option , copy the images to the same folder as the .@@ k@@ in file . &quot;
&quot; with the Automati@@ cally option to copy to the .@@ k@@ in file , copy and photo@@ album ; the images automatically for you . &quot;
&quot; .@@ k@@ im files are normal zip files . because most of the pictures have already been compressed with JPEG and the XML file itself is very small it is usually not worth comp@@ ressing the files . if you want to do so , simply select the Export File option . &quot;
&quot; the last option of this page is to limit maximum image size . if you send your friends pictures , you might not want to send the pictures in full size , since the .@@ k@@ in file would otherwise be very large . here you can limit the size by saying that each image should be at most 800 pixels high and wide . &quot;
&quot; when you select a file with the extension .@@ k@@ im from the web browser or from the File menu File ... , it will import the exported database as described in . &quot;
&quot; the wizard to import consists of four steps . first , you need to select which images you want to import , then in which folders the import images should be copied . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , you will be asked in the third dialog window , which categories of the imported file should be imported and what categories they are in your database . &quot;
&quot; in the fourth step , you can settle the categories of the imported file with the categories of your present database . an example of this is shown in the picture . &quot;
&quot; it must be easy to browse and view images : if you look at pictures , you often want to jump within different picture groups . if you see images of your Italy holiday and discover a picture with your friend , you may want to see all the pictures on which this friend is depicted . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will go through the various steps of ( 1 ) set of information about your pictures , about ( 2 ) searching and viewing , up to ( 3 ) advanced topics and custom@@ ization options . &quot;
&quot; K@@ Photo@@ Album has started as a program for managing your pictures . however , it has been extended and today it also takes care of your videos . in many places in this manual is talked about images , but often this includes videos . &quot;
&quot; this is a simple XML file that you can use with a program of your choice , e.g. Nor@@ mal backup tools , copy to a flo@@ ppy or re@@ visions in CVS , you can secure where they want . &quot;
&quot; when you want to read another database in &amp; k@@ photo@@ album , you can start a different folder with pictures , you can start a different folder with pictures , you can start with the -@@ c option . as an example : k@@ photo@@ album -@@ c ~ / company / images / inde@@ x@@ .x@@ ml . &quot;
&quot; via the menu entry Settings k@@ photo@@ album ; set up ... go to a window with which you can change the settings of your photo@@ album ; in the following section of the user manual , you will see the various settings options . &quot;
&quot; to the left you see six different symbols , with which you can view settings of the preview and the options for the viewer . for each setting , there is a detailed help available that can be accessed by pressing the F1 key and clicking on the desired option . &quot;
&quot; it describes how you can set different properties for each image , e.g. people , locations and keywords . you can also create your own groups , such as objects , animals or albums . &quot;
see the dialog that is used to edit existing groups . for each group you can select a label and a symbol .
&quot; in the Options dialog you can set up complete membership groups , e.g. set up all members of a group at one time in a group rather than explaining all groups of a member . &quot;
&quot; in the left window of the window , you can select the category you want to configure . in the left half of the window you will find a list of the current category and in the right a list of sub @-@ categories . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; shares its modular system with other graphic applications , such as digi@@ K@@ am and G@@ wen@@ view . this module system is called K@@ IP@@ I and means &amp; k@@ de ; Image plug @-@ in interface . &quot;
&quot; the modules can be called via the modules menu . the modules can and will not be described in this manual , as they are not part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; however , most modules have a help page that you can access via the modules themselves . &quot;
&quot; because the modules of several applications are shared among each other together , it may be that the modules have been tested with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; therefore you should always test new modules first with the demo database before using them on your own pictures using the command &gt; k@@ photo@@ album -@@ demo &lt; us@@ er@@ input \ &gt; or via the menu Help . don &apos;t say I would not have warned you ! &quot;
&quot; the applications that use the modules via K@@ IP@@ I are very different , which can be that some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; do not work . this is the disadvantage if you share functions with different applications . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference between &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; and other applications that also use K@@ IP@@ I , is that the other applications can arrange their pictures in albums : this kind of order isn &apos;t supported , it simul@@ ates the order after albums for some modules so that you can use the functions with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; &quot;
&quot; the current album , which is simply the current view , thus simul@@ ates all the pictures that show you the picture preview at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the current album , I have to release a compilation of albums ; the modules also have a list of albums . here is a CD album , as follows : &quot;
&quot; if &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; s browser displays the content of a category , for example , all persons , then each entry in this category represents an album for the module . &quot;
&quot; or it will use the category that you have specified in the setup dialog as category for virtual albums . so , for example , if you use the category people , then you will do a photo@@ album ; so do , so if you would have selected people to view and pass on this . &quot;
&quot; since some modules with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album are not compatible , you can remove them from the list of modules . &quot;
&quot; on the picture , you will see an example of a start screen as soon as you are on a photo@@ album ; start with your own images . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . at the moment , you will see the window with which you can browse your image database . &quot;
&quot; one of the main features of a photo@@ album is the possibility to ann@@ ot@@ ate any picture with comments . this includes information about the persons shown on the picture , where the picture has been taken . for example , you can set any picture individually or for a larger number of images at the same time . &quot;
&quot; all these notes can be used for searching and browsing , as you can read in the section . if you want , you can see these notes when using the built @-@ in viewer . &quot;
&quot; see three lists with a text box by defining people , locations and keywords . these are a very important part of &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; as you will always use them again whenever you type information about your pictures . &quot;
&quot; the following idea is to post@@ p@@ one the images within the list : if you have a family celebration and are displayed on all 50 pictures the same 5 @-@ 10 persons , you can , by moving the names used up , locate and assign the persons quicker . &quot;
&quot; if you prefer to receive an alphabe@@ tically sorted list , click on the sorting icon for date below the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected ann@@ ot@@ ations for each image individually , you may still want to edit all selected images and provide these images with ann@@ ot@@ ations . in this case , simply click on the buttons below and back buttons , which are located under the preview of the picture on the right . &quot;
&quot; if you have taken several images , e.g. with the same person , then it can be more convenient to mark all these images and use the menu item Sever@@ al entries at once with a note . &quot;
&quot; Las Vegas , San Francisco , Los Angeles and California are all located in the USA . San Francisco and Los Angeles are also located in California . &quot;
&quot; in the image , you can see a browser window showing the USA as a sub @-@ group . to show you that it is a super@@ group , a special symbol is displayed . &quot;
&quot; in the comment dialog context menu , it is possible to add an entry to an existing or new sub@@ category . additionally , you can simply drag an entry to a category and place it in order to make it a sub@@ category of this entry . &quot;
&quot; you can move the individual elements of the comment dialog by clicking and moving the bar that forms the upper edge of the frame , and you can also make a separate window from a frame by moving it out of the window pane . &quot;
&quot; if you have adjusted the look of the window to your needs , that you are satisfied with the settings , click the Options button ... which offers you the possibility to save the current layout and appearance of the window . &quot;
&quot; you can also completely hide a box . if you want to see this window again later , use the Options button ... and then hide windows . this is shown in the picture . &quot;
&quot; if you select the view images in your browser , you will get an overview with preview images of the currently selected images , or all images if you don &apos;t have a filter . an example of this is how you can configure the size of thumb@@ nails by simply dra@@ gging the mouse with the middle mouse button . &quot;
&quot; if you drop a picture on the background of your desktop , this image will be set up as a background image for your desktop . &quot;
&quot; once you click on a picture , this will be displayed in the image viewer . if you have not yet opened a window with an image viewer , a new window will be created . &quot;
you can also delete pictures in the preview preview . simply select the respective images you want to delete and press either the Del@@ ete key or select Del@@ ete the Edit menu . now the window will appear that you can see in the picture .
&quot; you can use with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; you can also use images without saving you on the hard disk . of course you need to store the images somewhere , so that &amp; k@@ photo@@ album . in the picture you can see the view from &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; if not all needed images can be loaded from the hard drive . &quot;
&quot; images in which the right upper corner is cut off are not stored on the hard disk . however , the thumb@@ nails are available for the pictures 5 @-@ 9 so that you can preview these images . however , you can not view these images using the image viewer . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , this function requires you to copy files from the folders and copy them back . &quot;
&quot; in the Image menu , you will find a sub @-@ menu with the name privacy . if you want to have a little more privacy , filter the images so that at the end those that you want to make accessible to others and click &quot; &quot; Lock &quot; &quot; in the menu privacy . alternatively , you can also control all the images that your little sister can see , control and lock the menu entry All except current view . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to specify which images should be hidden in the case of the case . if you want to give the laptop to your little sister , simply select the menu entry to lock images , so that all the images you have blocked will fade out . if you want to get the pictures visible again , click on lock . &quot;
&quot; it is also possible to set a password which needs to be entered to unlock the images . to set up this password , simply change password in the Privacy menu . &quot;
&quot; please bear in mind that this picture protection is by no means very safe . on one hand , all the images on the hard drive and on the other one can read or delete the password as un@@ encrypted text . this kind of password protection is only for those who are not very familiar with the view to private images . &quot;
&quot; the reason why you want all your pictures with &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; manage and spend hours over hours with it is natural that you want to view them sometime . for this reason , has a photo@@ album ; via an image _ and video viewer . this can be started from the preview as described in . &quot;
&quot; you can see the viewer in it . of course , it shows the image , but additional all the information you have entered through the image , such as who is on the picture , when and where was it done , etc . &quot;
&quot; if the information box on the top of the image you want to see , you can simply drag them with the mouse and place somewhere else . you can also configure what information is displayed and whether information is displayed at all . all these options are available after a right click on the viewer . &quot;
&quot; if you click on Anne Hel@@ ene , the browser will show you all the images of Anne Hel@@ ene . as if you had selected people from the browser and then Anne Hel@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; if you have loaded multiple images in the viewer , you can switch between them before and after by using the buttons image up and down . you can jump to the first and last picture with Pos@@ 1 and End . these functions can also be reached from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; when multiple images are loaded in the viewer , you can let them run as a slide show . &amp; k@@ photo@@ album ; then loads a new image after a few seconds . how often it loads a new image can be controlled by pressing the C@@ trl key and plus or minus . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , the viewer uses the complete space on the screen . simply use the input button to switch to full screen mode and back . &quot;
&quot; if you are using the viewer you can move in the image and zoom out . to zoom in , you can simply pull out a rect@@ angle with the mouse . with the minus button , you can zoom out again The plus button zo@@ oms in the middle of the image . shows how a zoom rect@@ angle is selected and shows the outcome of the zoom . &quot;
&quot; with the point button , you can reset your zoom , so that the image is not zo@@ omed . using the power button sets the zoom , so that every pixel on the screen matches a pixel of the image . &quot;
note that the only zo@@ om@@ operations that work with videos that come in and zoom out with the plus and minus key .
with the rotation functions from the context menu you can rotate the image . this is not working with videos . you can make notes to the current image using the menu item Rem@@ arks from the context menu .
&quot; when you look at pictures it may happen that you will find a picture with a person whose name you have forgotten on the image . at the moment , you can view it and open the configuration dialog of the image to enter this name . &quot;
&quot; another situation is that you want to send a number of images to a printer to get the images developed on paper . to see what photos you want , you can start the viewer with the pictures and mark them as good or bad while you visit one by one . &quot;
&quot; for the two examples above , the viewer gives you the possibility to add images with features while viewing them . features are the letters A to Z and you can set a feature by pressing the corresponding letter . in the picture you see a picture where the characteristics A , B and C are set . &quot;
&quot; as soon as you have set features on your images , they are available in your browser . so if you have all the images you are editing , printing or whatever they have chosen , you can use a module to copy the selected images to a CD or whatever you want to do . &quot;
&quot; categories and particularly features can be displayed in the preview screen . if you can view categories in dre preview view , then you can add features to the images by simply pressing the letter for the mark after the image was selected . you can see this here : &quot;
sometimes it is not clear what you want to show on a picture .
&quot; the batch is not saved with the image , but in the database . &quot;
&quot; in order to switch on the painting mode from the context menu . to complete the painting , simply press the cross in the tool@@ bar at the top of the window . &quot;
&quot; to be able to work with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; you need to master the application of the program &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; not fully master , but the documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; should you absolutely have read and understood . &quot;
in the object tree you can select individual objects . then their properties are displayed in the object properties and the object is shown in the wire mod@@ ell@@ - views yellow .
&quot; you can also select multiple objects at the same time . however , not the sub @-@ object of an already selected object , since all sub @-@ objects are already selected with the object . &quot;
&quot; to insert a new object into the object tree , select the position you want to insert the object and click on the icon in the tool@@ bar or select a menu entry in the In@@ sert menu . &quot;
&quot; if there are several possible positions , the following drop @-@ down menu opens , so that you can choose the right position : &quot;
you can delete selected objects from the scene with del@@ eting either from the Edit menu bar or from the context menu of the right mouse button .
&quot; if you have changed properties , click App@@ ly to take over these changes . if you have entered invalid values , a message will be displayed with an error description . &quot;
&quot; if you enter the path to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ user documentation in the setup dialog , you can call the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; -@@ reference to the displayed object by means of help . &quot;
&quot; you need the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g or 3.5 H@@ MT@@ L user documentation to use this feature . if this documentation is not included in your distribution , you can download it here . &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 already contains the user documentation . &quot;
&quot; if you edit a texture or part of a texture , you can see a preview in the property view . &quot;
&quot; press Pre@@ view in the Properties View and a small sample of the scene is rendered with the chosen texture . as default the entire texture is rendered , even if you want a sub @-@ ordered item ( for example a texture within a texture map and not the entire texture map ) , tick local . &quot;
the screen@@ shot shows the camera control points . you can drag these control points with the mouse button and change the position and direction of the camera .
&quot; when a transformation is selected , the check@@ points disappear and a small cross is displayed in the wireless model view . this cross marks the center for sc@@ aling and rotation as well as the position for shifts . you can change the shift by dra@@ gging with the mouse within the entire window . &quot;
each object has a Visi@@ bility level as a wireless model . you can specify this value relative to the level of visibility of the higher object or as an absolute value . objects are displayed only if they are selected or their Visi@@ bility level is smaller or equal to the Visi@@ bility level selected in the tool@@ bar .
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; has a window arrangement as default . the object tree and the view of the object properties are displayed on the left and the four graphical views on the right .
&quot; if you don &apos;t like the standard window arrangement , or if you need a different arrangement , you can adjust it at any time . you can also save several window orders and switch between different configurations . &quot;
&quot; to anchor a window above or below a view , drag the upper or lower edge of a view . a rect@@ angle then shows the new position . &quot;
&quot; to create a new column , drag the poin@@ ter to the right or left side of a view . the new view is then anchored to the right or left side of this view and extends over the entire height . &quot;
&quot; if you want to arrange multiple views over one another , drag the p@@ asser in the middle of a different view . you can then switch between views by clicking on the map Le@@ aders above in the views . &quot;
&quot; the last possible window arrangement is floating views : views that are not anchored in the main window . in order to solve a view from the anch@@ or@@ age , drag the poin@@ ter to the desktop or click on the little arrow pointing to the left in the fas@@ cia bar . &quot;
&quot; to close a view , click on the small cross in the tool@@ bar . to prevent closing , click on the small square between the arrow and the cross . &quot;
&quot; you can insert additional views in the main window . in the View menu , you will find entries for each type of views . new views are floating , you can anchor them at any place . &quot;
the current window view can be saved in view of window arrangement ... saving . a dialog appears where you can save the window arrangement under an existing or new name .
&quot; if you have created a scene , you can render them . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; used &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.@@ 1@@ g for rendering , this program must be properly installed . when this manual was written , &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; 3.5 currently . this version is not supported in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; version 1.0 is not supported . &quot;
&quot; to render the current scene , click the Ren@@ dering icon The Ren@@ dering icon in the tool@@ bar or choose the menu entry view scene . &quot;
&quot; a render mode corresponds to entries in &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; s ini files . it determines the image size and quality of rendering . if you want to render a scene in different image sizes and quality levels , you can insert any number of R@@ ender modes , from a quick preview to full images of the highest quality . &quot;
&quot; if you click on the render settings icon in the tool@@ bar or select R@@ ender Mo@@ di , the following dialog will be opened : &quot;
each rendering mode has a name . you can enter any name but sense is a name that lets you recognize the properties of the mode .
&quot; in the size of the map , you can enter the width and height of the rendered image . if you only want to render a small area of the picture , select the inter@@ sections check box and enter the image cut@@ out for rendering in the input fields . &quot;
in combination field quality you can select the properties that &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; used for rendering . this goes from a very simple color and light model to a model with complex diff@@ use reflection lighting . a detailed description of the R@@ ender features can be found in the user manual to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; .
&quot; if a picture is rendered with only one beam per pixel , different errors can occur . these images often have a Mo@@ ir@@ è patterns or patterns in curves and lines , and sometimes details are not shown when they are smaller than a pixel . this effect is called ali@@ asing . &quot;
&amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; uses a technique called Anti @-@ Ali@@ asing to reduce the impact of these errors . generally pictures with this property are better .
&quot; if you switch on anti @-@ ali@@ asing , calcul@@ ates and connects &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; more than one beam per pixel . this technique is called super @-@ sampling . &quot;
&quot; &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; supports two methods of super @-@ sampling . as standard is an adaptive , non @-@ recur@@ sive method ; adaptive because the super @-@ sampling is applied to the adjacent pixels . the second method is adaptive @-@ recur@@ sive ; recur@@ sively because each pixel is continuously split up and adapted because the rec@@ ord@@ inal depth depends on the calculated h@@ ues . &quot;
&quot; if you choose the first method , POV @-@ Ray monitors a beam per pixel . if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold , a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated , with a depth value of 5 then 5@@ x@@ 5 ( 25 ) additional rays per pixel . &quot;
&quot; the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows : r 1 , g 1 and b 1 are the values for red , green and blue of the first pixel , r 2 , g 2 and b 2 are the values for red , green and blue of the second pixel . &quot;

&quot; the recur@@ sive method starts with 4 rays per pixel . if the difference between the color values exceeds the given threshold , then the pixel is divided into 4 sub @-@ pixels that are individually followed and tested for further sub@@ division . the maximum depth of the recur@@ sion can be adjusted with the depth value . &quot;
&quot; another way to reduce the ali@@ asing effect is the generation of noise for the ray process , called J@@ it@@ tering . if you switch J@@ it@@ tering , changed &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; the beams for a tiny amount to avoid regular patterns . &quot;
the last setting for rendering quality is diff@@ use reflection . this is an experimental property of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; which calcul@@ ates diff@@ use light reflection . it takes very long to calculate a scene with this property .
on this card you can specify whether the alpha channels are to be calculated by POV @-@ Ray . a pixel is then transparent when the associated rays have not hit the object .
&quot; opens a new window for displaying the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; console output . if &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; un@@ expect@@ edly terminated , you can find the reason for it here . &quot;
&quot; to import one &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; scene import , select the menu entry file Import ... and select a file in the dialog window . &quot;
currently supports &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; not yet the complete command set of &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; when im@@ porting error messages or warnings a dialog window displays a list of all messages .
if you do not support source code in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; import this source code between the two particular comments / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ Beg@@ in and / / * PM@@ Ra@@ w@@ End .
&quot; you can drag objects from the object tree into the editor to export the source text for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; this adds the source text of the object to the editor . to import objects to the scene , simply mark the source code in the editor and drag it into the object tree . &quot;
with copying and past@@ ing in &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; and in your editor you can add source code for &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; also insert .
the POV @-@ Ray command is called when &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; a scene ren@@ ders . usually this is po@@ v@@ ray or x @-@ po@@ v@@ ray .
&quot; if you click on Help in the property view , &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; User Docum@@ entation to the displayed object . please insert the path to your documentation and the version . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ov@@ ray ; searches for external files ( for example vertical data ) in the paths to the &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; libraries . if you include files that are not in the folder of the scene , you must also enter the path to those files here . if a file is found in different paths of the library , the first found file is used . &quot;
the color for the wire models . the second color is used for displaying selected objects .
the color for the check points . the second color is used for displaying selected control points .
the color of the rect@@ angle for the view field in the camera view and in the window type marks .
&quot; you can set the object capture of the points to the grid in the context menu of the wire model views . you can set the grid separately for shifts , sc@@ aling and rotation . &quot;
&quot; larger values result in a more accurate wire model and thus better approxim@@ ation for the displayed objects , but require more time for rendering . for some objects such as the sphere , you can set the level of detail separately for two directions . &quot;
&quot; if you check the high detail fi@@ del@@ ity for advanced projections , all wire model views are further sub@@ divided if the camera uses an advanced projection . advanced projections are all projections with exceptions from the perspective and vertical projections . this property gives a better approach to projections , but requires more time for rendering . &quot;
&quot; when you tick the wall , a wall behind the objects is rendered . the wall is displayed in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern of two adjustable colours . &quot;
the bottom is rendered in a ch@@ ess@@ board pattern made of two adjustable colours .
&quot; if you tick the edge smooth@@ ing , the non @-@ recur@@ sive anti @-@ ali@@ asing method is used for rendering the scenes . you can adjust the values for depth and threshold value . more details on the parameters can be found in the section R@@ ender @-@ Mo@@ di . &quot;
&quot; on this page , you can change existing window orders or create new window orders . in the window pan@@ es section explains how to create and store window orders . &quot;
the Standard window arrangement : displays all existing window orders . &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; uses the selected window arrangement when starting the program .
the list of existing window orders shows all existing window orders . you can create a new arrangement with the Add button and delete a selected arrangement with the Del@@ ete button .
each window arrangement is identified by the name . the name must be unique and must not be empty .
the list below the name shows all views for the selected window arrangement . new views can be added with the Add button and select selected views with the Del@@ ete button .
&quot; with New column , create a new column on the right side of the existing window , with Un@@ ten anchor the window under the existing window , with cards you get a flash@@ card view together with the previous view and flo@@ ats up the view not in the main window , but creates a separate window . &quot;
&quot; so you have straight &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; and &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; installed and now you want to start without more detailed knowledge of both programs . if you follow all steps in this guide , you should be able to create the ultimate but simple scene , among beginners very popular : one ball at one level . &quot;
&quot; but you should carefully observe the following warnings before you complain that you only receive a black screen as a result . if you use a 3D program for the first time , you should consider these important rules : &quot;
&quot; if you do not set a camera , no rules can be applied to rendering , as a result you get a black image . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t want to insert light sources , your whole scene is in the dark and you get only a black picture . &quot;
&quot; if you have installed everything without error , see the first start of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; the following pre @-@ set window arrangement : &quot;
take a little time to get to know the menus and the icons of the tool@@ bar . please read the documentation to get a reasonable idea of what you can expect from this program .
&quot; you will often have to use these menus and symbols , so you should remember the menus and symbols and their application . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; starts with a simple scene . to follow this guide , you must first remove all objects from the object tree . select the scene and then select the Edit menu item . so you now have a scene without objects . &quot;
this is the view of the scene from the view of the camera . this shows you the result of the rendering of the scene .
&quot; the object tree now contains a new entry with the name camera . if you click on it , you will see the contents of the view object properties in which the different parameters of the camera can be found . in the user documentation to &amp; P@@ ov@@ ray ; see for more details . &quot;
&quot; do not change the basic settings of the camera , this is subject to later instructions , but note that the camera is in the view control points with which you can change the target of the camera . simply click with the left mouse button on a control point and drag it to the desired position . &quot;
&quot; if you press the user or press the input button , the wire model views and the object tree change according to these settings . as a result , they see the scene from the view of the camera . &quot;
&quot; there are many ways to create the ground for the scene . for example , you could insert a header ( insert fin@@ ite body boxes ) and adjust the size to x = 100 , y = 0 and z = 100 , but this is a complicated method to solve this task . &quot;
&amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; actually provides a simpler way . you can use an infinite plane as floor :
&quot; a good advice : select the plain in the object tree , change the name and then press the App@@ den button or enter the input button . in the object tree , the new name will be displayed immediately . &quot;
&quot; the view of the wire model now also shows the level , albeit at the moment only as a fin@@ ite level . if you render the scene , the plane expands to the horizon . &quot;
&quot; if you look at the object tree exactly , you will find that you can fold the entry for the bottom if you click on the icon + in front of the object . in this case , you will only see the default options for each new object : sc@@ aling , rotation and displacement . &quot;
&quot; in this scene , you should move the floor to exercise a unit under the horizontal line , just to get to know some of these parameters . select Shift and set the values as follows : &quot;
&quot; first select the floor to adjust its material properties . there are many different materials , but select something simple at the moment . &quot;
&quot; in both cases , a dialog box opens where you can select how the object should be inserted . please select first sub@@ object . the pigment will then be displayed in the object tree . you can change the name in the property view ( name = bottom pigment ) , with a click on the button Pre@@ view you see how the pigment now looks . &quot;
&quot; of course , the Pig@@ ment Pre@@ view shows only a matte black material because you have to enter the pigment settings at any time with a click on Pre@@ view . now , please always remember that you can preview the color of the pigment at any time with a click on preview . &quot;
&quot; if you don &apos;t see any color on the header and ball in the preview , click the App@@ ly button and then click the Pre@@ view . &quot;
&quot; the material for the floor is now set correctly . if you rent your image now with a click on the symbol , you should get the following result : &quot;
&quot; in the color list you need to enter two new attributes , called Uni@@ coloured . then edit this entry twice ( you can do this even more often , but the ch@@ ess@@ board color list can only be used with two colors ) : &quot;
always select one color in the object tree and change the colors in the view of the object properties :
you should already simply execute this step as you have already understood the basic working method of &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; the ball can be just as simple as the floor :
&quot; in the view of the object properties , you can immediately change the settings . set the value for the radius : on 1 ( don &apos;t forget to press the input button or the user button ) , so the ball has contact with the ground . otherwise , the ball would float above the ground , since you have moved the ground around one unit . &quot;
&quot; of course , rendering now results in a strange result : as seen before , the ball surface appears like a matt black material . &quot;
&quot; once you have selected the ball , you can now assign a material to it . as with the floor , give the ball a pigment as color : &quot;
&quot; select first sub@@ object and change the name for example in the sphere of Pig@@ ment . click on the Pig@@ ment ball , then select Uni@@ coloured and set the values as follows : &quot;
but you can achieve more interesting effects if you take the time to set some finish properties :
then change the values as in the following screen@@ shots and click App@@ ly or press En@@ ter .
&quot; the settings shine @-@ effect and reflection already give some good visual effects , perfect for glass or chro@@ med surfaces , even if metal is not yet selected : &quot;
&quot; you should now have a good impression of what possibilities you use &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; hopefully you have learned so much , which you can create simple but beautiful scenes . &quot;
Ray@@ trac@@ y@@ cing is a R@@ ender method to create a two @-@ dimensional image of a three @-@ dimensional scene or model .
&quot; when you cycle a scene ra@@ y@@ trac@@ ts , the rendering of hyp@@ othe@@ tical rays shot from the viewer &apos;s perspective ( i.e. from the camera that ren@@ ders the scenes ) through each pixel in the scene . &quot;
&quot; as you can imagine , you won &apos;t see anything without a camera , the camera is your eye with which you look at the scene . without a light source you also see nothing , the image is just black . obviously , every scene that should be rendered is need some light sources and at least one camera . &quot;
&quot; in the usual file dialog , you can select your file . P@@ ov@@ ray files usually have the file extension * .@@ po@@ v or * .@@ in@@ c . &quot;
&quot; open a file . in the standard file dialog , you can select a file that you have created previously with &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; &quot;
&quot; whenever you open or create a new model , the file will be inserted into this sub @-@ menu and replaces the oldest entry in the list . &quot;
&quot; if you have already saved the model , it will be saved under the same name . if it is a new file , you need to enter a name and a disk space . &quot;
reco@@ vers the scene in the last saved version . all changes since the last storage are dis@@ car@@ ded .
you can only select this menu entry if you have not yet saved any saved changes in the scene .
repeat the last revers@@ ed command . this menu entry can only be selected if you have used Edit undo .
saves the current window arrangement and opens a dialog where you can enter a name for a new arrangement or over@@ write an existing order .
&quot; in this menu you will find options for setting &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ modeling ; , here you can change the look , short@@ cuts and the default behavior . &quot;
&quot; opens a dialog for changing the keyboard short@@ cuts . with this option , you can add pre @-@ set short commands for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er ; modify commands or add new ones . &quot;
opens a dialog to set up the tool@@ bar . you can add and remove tool symbols for &amp; k@@ po@@ v@@ model@@ er with this option .
&quot; a b@@ ump map is a way to simulate rough surfaces , without having to model each b@@ ump on the surface individually and without changing the geomet@@ rical shape of the object itself . &quot;
it is common to use the same file for a dump map as well as for a texture map .
basic shapes are simple geometric shapes you can use as building blocks : very complex 3D models are produced from dozens or even hundreds of these basic bodies . these models are then further processed to give them a more realistic look .
&quot; a texture map is a way to give the surface of an object color to pixel basis , by applying a picture file as a color card . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is a convenient image viewer and browser . the application has a file browser , in which you can select images for viewing . &quot;
images can be displayed either in a separate window in the size of the image or in full screen mode .
the use of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; is very simple . the file browser lists files that you can view by clicking the &amp; L@@ MB@@ n ; or the key return .
&quot; you can specify whether each image should be displayed in a separate window , or whether all images should always use the same window . &quot;
&quot; if you are searching for a specific file , simply type the first characters of the fil@@ en@@ ame in the browser window . then a small input field appears in the bottom right corner . if a matching file name was found , the file will be highlighted . you can leave the input field by pressing Return or &amp; Es@@ c . &quot;
&quot; in the dialog Box - &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show , there are five card cards . in three of them , General and editing and slideshow , you can set the working method of &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the other two , short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser , the short@@ cuts can be specified for each window . &quot;
&quot; if the image is not large enough to fill the screen , the rest of the display surface is filled with the background color you can set further down . default is not full screen mode . &quot;
&quot; this point is activated , loading &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; already the next image in the folder , while you are still viewing the current image . this reduces the delay when you choose the next image and is particularly suitable for a slideshow . &quot;
with this option save &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; when you exit the name of the last opened folder . at the next start opening &amp; ku@@ ick@@ Show ; this folder in the browser window .
&quot; click on the colored bars to select a background color . this is used in order to fill the background of the screen in full screen mode . if in window mode the window is larger than the image , the background is filled with the selected color . &quot;
you can set up a file type to display only some of the file types that the program can display .
&quot; with this option , the display window will be enlarged to the full screen for large images . this option is turned on as default . &quot;
specify whether the slide show should start with the first image in the folder or with the selected image .
&quot; to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the slider or the small arrows on the right of the input field . default is 3 seconds . &quot;
&quot; if this value is set to 0 , the slideshow will be repeated until it is abor@@ ted by the user . to change the value , you can enter a new value in the input field or use the sli@@ ders or small arrows on the right of the input field . default is 1 . &quot;
change the short@@ cuts for the various modes of operation at &amp; Ku@@ ick@@ Show ; in the flash@@ cards short commands for the display window and short commands for the browser .
&quot; with this option , switch between the two @-@ part view of the fil@@ esystem ( a window for the sub@@ folders and a window for the files ) and the one @-@ part view of the file system with folders and files in a window . &quot;
displays large icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
displays small icons for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
displays preview images for the files in the folder . this ad is only possible in the short presentation .
reduces the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
increases the image by 10 % . the factor refers to the current size of the image .
closes the display window for the pictures . &amp; Ku@@ ick@@ Show ; will also be closed if no browser window is opened .
show the image in original size . this is only useful when the automatic sc@@ aling is activated .
&quot; enter the first character of the file name you are looking for . if the file is found , it will be selected . &quot;
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ photo processing based on the &amp; digi@@ kam ; image processing . &amp; show@@ photo ; is part of the &amp; digi@@ kam ; project .
&amp; show@@ photo ; is a fast image processing with some powerful base tools . you can use it to view your photos and perform correc@@ tions and changes .
&quot; like the rest of &amp; k@@ de ; is &amp; show@@ shot ; an open source project . this means it is dependent on the user to contribute its part , at least problems and possible improvements . &quot;
&quot; this displays a dialog with a link . this displays a dialog with a link . if you are using it , your browser will open a page to report problems and desires . &quot;
&quot; show photo ; is a project that is supported by a community . that is , users and developers can help each other . if you are a frequent user of a show photo ; if you are a frequent user of a show photo ; then we would like to ask you questions to other users of &amp; show@@ photo ; however , you may be able to answer questions about other users . &quot;
&quot; the best start to participate in a show photo ; to participate , it is the developer mailing list to join . guide to join the developer mailing list of &amp; show@@ photo ; . &quot;
&quot; &amp; show@@ photo ; try to give you as much control over his workflow as possible . there are many options that modify the behavior of the show photo ; in order to access these settings , you need to select the show@@ picture in the menu . you can switch between them by clicking on the icons of the left side . &quot;
&quot; in the field of exposure indicators , you can select the color that is displayed when the under@@ - or over@@ exposure indicator is selected . dex@@ ter@@ ity should indicate a bright color and over@@ exposure a dark color . &quot;
&quot; the main window of the show photo ; has a side bar at the right edge , which provides you with important information and actions to the selected images . you can also find the same page bar in the image editing . you can view these in which you click on one of the five riders : &quot;
&amp; sc@@ aling ; is an application for scanning images that do not power anymore than scan and save images .
&quot; &amp; nbsp l@@ ite ; is a simple application for scanning images that no longer makes images to scan and save images . &amp; channel l@@ ite ; can open a dialog for each image to save images , or save images immediately in a specified folder with automatically generated names and format . the user can also display the images before saving . &quot;
you can check the status of your scanner support on the SA@@ NE project page by entering the necessary information on this page : HTTP : / / www.@@ san@@ e @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org / c@@ gi @-@ bin / dri@@ ver@@ .@@ pl .
&quot; a standard scanner can be set at the command line of the scann@@ l@@ ite -@@ d &#91; device name &#93; in the terminal . if this scanner cannot be opened or if no standard scanner is specified , then a dialog for selecting the scanner is opened . &quot;
the user can select the scanner to use and press OK to open the scanner . cancel the scanner ; exit .
the other settings contain more detailed options of the driver . &amp; nbsp l@@ ite ; ( lib@@ ks@@ ane ) does not deal with these options particularly .
&quot; to view a picture , the user can only start a preview and then scan for the scanning range for the final scan . the preview can be started by the preview button . &quot;
&quot; to better select the image , the user can zoom into the image and zoom out of the current selection . it can also set the zoom in such a way that the complete preview fits into the window . &quot;
&quot; if the image has been selected , the final image can be read with the scan button . &quot;
&quot; if saving a preview in the settings selected before saving , then the image will be displayed in a preview window , as shown below . if saving is pressed , then the image will be saved and Sch@@ lie will get back to the main window . &quot;
&quot; by the Settings button , the same name dialog is opened in front of the main window . you can change the most important settings here . &quot;
&quot; the user can view the image if desired before saving . in this case , the option must be selected before saving a preview . if this preview is not desired by the user , then the option must be checked . &quot;
&quot; this setting allows them to select the way they want to save images . dialog to save each image opens the dialog before each scann@@ ed image . if &amp; channel l@@ ite ; this will automatically save it with a generated name in a previously defined folder , then you must select Save without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . &quot;
&quot; this setting defines where the images are stored in the Save As option without asking for a fil@@ en@@ ame . if the images are stored after each scan , then this folder is used as the default for the dialog to save . the default value is your home directory and you can change this with the button ... &quot;
&quot; this parameter defines a picture pre@@ fix for the images to be saved automatically , and is also the proposed name for the image in the dialog to save . the automatically saved image gets a num@@ eric suff@@ ix of each time a picture is stored . the character string # # # is replaced by the numbers . &quot;
&quot; the user can adjust the image quality used to save . this value also changes the compression value when saving . if choosing the image quality is not selected , then the default value of Q@@ t is used . &quot;
the button Tools starts the K@@ DE Help with the &amp; Book@@ l@@ ite ; manual . the button On starts the K@@ DE About dialog for &amp; Channel ; . the Settings button displays the dialog for the settings and closing can be used to end &amp; exit .
it is licensed under the GP@@ L and lib@@ ks@@ ane library used by &amp; cann@@ l@@ ite ; under L@@ GP@@ L . attention : lib@@ san@@ e is licensed under the GP@@ L with an exception .
&quot; the global keyboard short@@ cut allows you to set up a list of these short@@ cuts and their function . the global keyboard short@@ cuts can be set up by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , selecting Global Keyboard Sh@@ ort@@ cuts ... Select the right mouse button in the player window and select short commands ... Select . &quot;
you may want to set up existing multimedia keys so that they work as &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Sh@@ ort@@ cuts . this makes your keyboard a &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center .
&quot; the D@@ CO@@ P interface of Amar@@ ok has many general functions that are usually also found in other K@@ DE programs . this section consists of six parts and is intended to describe the D@@ CO@@ P functions of collection , context browser , player , playlist , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , play@@ lists , and scripts . &quot;
Amar@@ ok supports command line options from Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de ; additionally Amar@@ ok has some own command line options .
&quot; you should give the user a feedback if the script cannot be executed because of a lack of dependency . please check in your script , if all necessary modules are present and use k@@ Dialog so that the user knows why a script does not run . &quot;
Beg@@ in require &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um &apos; Res@@ cue Lo@@ ad@@ Error error = &apos; Cor@@ und@@ um ( K@@ DE b@@ ind@@ ings for ru@@ by ) from k@@ nu@@ ind@@ ings V@@ 3.4 is required for this script . &apos;
in the scripts / templates folder you will find a lot of template scripts in many different languages . you can use them as the basis for your own scripts or simply add them to the required functions . you will quickly find that writing scripts is relatively simple .
&quot; using D@@ CO@@ P , your scripts can exchange data with Amar@@ ok and control Amar@@ ok . the easiest way is to use the d@@ co@@ p command , which should include any K@@ DE installation . &quot;
most scrip@@ ting languages allow the execution of external programs and commands . this is usually called ex@@ ec ( ) . this way d@@ co@@ p &gt; can be called relatively easily . here is an example in Python :
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; sends noti@@ fications to all running scripts . for this purpose , strings are written to the standard input of the script . for this reason , scripts should continuously monitor their default input and react accordingly to events . of course , a script can ignore the events even if there is no use for it . &quot;
&quot; configure the script to display the setup dialog . to save and load the setup data , each script must take care of itself . when a script is started , Amar@@ ok puts the work folder to the folder where all data should be stored . &quot;
tra@@ ck@@ Change sign@@ alizes that a new piece is played . the script could now ask for more information about the new piece with D@@ CO@@ P functions ( for example the metadata or the piece length ) .
volum@@ e@@ Change new@@ volume indicates a change in volume . the new volume is an integ@@ er between 0 and 100 .
&quot; custom@@ Men@@ u@@ Cli@@ cked : sub@@ menu it@@ em@@ Tit@@ le paths Con@@ tains the path to the selected files of the playlist , when a custom menu entry has been cli@@ cked . to remove an entry , you can use d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok script add@@ Custom@@ Men@@ u@@ It@@ em ( sub@@ menu item title ) . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; Amar@@ ok ; finishes , or when the user stops a script , sends &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the signal SI@@ G@@ TER@@ M to the script . &quot;
Amar@@ o@@ ks script administration can also install script packages that the user has downloaded from a web server . we recommend an archive name like e.g. my@@ scri@@ p@@ t.@@ amar@@ ok@@ script t.@@ tar@@ .@@ bz@@ 2 so that the user can clearly recognize the archive as a Amar@@ ok script package .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 will only accept script packages with the backup amar@@ ok@@ script . for this reason , you should properly design@@ ate your script packages . &quot;
&quot; the main script must be exec@@ utable ( + x ) , the other modules to be loaded should not be exec@@ utable . use the T@@ ar parameter -@@ p to obtain the file rights : &quot;
if your script package is ready you can add it to www.@@ k@@ de @-@ app@@ s.@@ org and attach the link to the Wi@@ ki script page of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; attach . for your entry on k@@ de @-@ apps you should use the category Amar@@ ok ; scripts .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for &amp; k@@ de ; . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; has many useful and powerful features and is still surprisingly easy to use .
&quot; with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you can simply drag music into the playlist , instead of having to work through endless menus . maybe you &apos;re looking for a very specific title from thousands in your collection . with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s Collector Browser and quick search you &apos;ll find the piece within seconds . &quot;
&quot; if you already have some play@@ lists , but can never decide which you want to hear ? then , the play@@ lists browser is the right thing for you . and if the decision is still difficult for you , the dynamic mode and the smart play@@ lists automatically select the right music according to certain criteria . &quot;
&quot; Amar@@ ok has excellent support for Apple &apos;s iPod , i@@ Ri@@ vers i@@ f@@ p and many generic USB devices . besides , many different audio systems can be used , so YOU can choose how to listen to your music . these and many more useful functions make Amar@@ ok the most advanced audio player . Amar@@ ok is intelligent , sexy and chic - just the right way to re@@ discover your music ! &quot;
&quot; usually , in the base folder of the Amar@@ ok sources you have to enter the following to compile and install Amar@@ ok : &quot;
&quot; because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should not have any problems with comp@@ iling . if you encounter problems , please report them to the &amp; k@@ de ; mailing lists . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; like most applications , has some options that you can activate or disable to compile time using the configure script . this is a list of options available . &quot;
&quot; for some of the compile options , certain depen@@ dencies must be met so that they can be used . details can be found in the system requirements section . &quot;
&quot; activate de@@ bu@@ gging symbols . you have the choice between yes , no and full . if you want to help with the development of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you should use full . &quot;
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; can be set up without effort over the setup dialog . the setup dialog has several card cards to set up the various functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
&quot; in addition to the player window , the player window will be added to the playlist in addition to the playlist . if the option is off , only the play@@ lists window will be displayed . &quot;
use mood bar@@ ometer : this feature is only available when &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . the option activ@@ ates the experimental function of the tuning bar@@ ometer .
design : this function is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . this will change the color scheme used for the mood bar@@ ometer .
&quot; add mood files to the music files : this feature is only available if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with support for m@@ ood@@ bar compiled . if this setting is enabled , .@@ mood files are stored at the location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the memory location of the appropriate music files . otherwise , the .@@ mood files are stored in the settings folder of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; normally ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / m@@ ood@@ bar / ) . &quot;
external browser : lets you choose which browser from &amp; Amar@@ ok ; should be started when a browser is required .
&quot; use other browsers : here , you can specify the path to another browser , which is not in the list . &quot;
&quot; save Play@@ list when you exit , save the current playlist automatically when you exit &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . enable this option if you do not want to lose the current playlist when you exit . &quot;
&quot; relative paths for manually saved play@@ lists : when you enable this setting , &amp; Amar@@ ok ; relative paths to the music files , starting from the location of the playlist , use . otherwise , the absolute position of the music files is stored . &quot;
&quot; to keep the current piece visible when changing pieces , the play@@ lists window will pop up / off to keep the current piece in the visible window area . &quot;
&quot; when changing pieces to the context @-@ browser , it automatically displays the context @-@ browser as soon as the next piece is played . &quot;
in the Ap@@ pear@@ ance section you can adjust &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s appearance . the section is divided into three parts .
&quot; in the font section you can set the use of various fonts in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; by selecting Custom fonts , the otherwise gray section will be activated . you can select fonts for the following range : play@@ lists windows , player windows and context Browser . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of custom color scheme , you have the choice of choice and can set your own color scheme . use the color sel@@ ector activated for foreground and background color . &quot;
&quot; continue on startup , that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; after program start , resume playing automatically with the piece at the point , with which it was stopped during the last stop . &quot;
&quot; setting up the On @-@ Screen display allows you to switch on the O@@ SD . when you are switched on @-@ screen display , a preview of the O@@ SD will be displayed and you can view the effect of all settings in this preview directly . &quot;
the first option is the font . click Select ... to select from the dialog the desired font for the O@@ SD . the check box Shadow causes the text to be displayed in the O@@ SD .
&quot; use your own colors gives you the option to adjust the O@@ SD colors for font and background . clicking on the color surfaces opens the dialog for color selection . if sel@@ e colors do not use , the pre @-@ set &amp; k@@ de colors will be used . &quot;
&quot; the display text input field displays the text displayed in the O@@ SD . by entering wild@@ cards , the O@@ SD can be adapted to your own needs . below you will find a list of available plac@@ eholders and what they mean . &quot;
the screen option is intended for X@@ iner@@ ama users . this allows you to specify on which screen of a multi @-@ monitor environment the O@@ SD should appear .
the card audio output lets you select an audio driver from the drop @-@ down sel@@ ector . some drivers activate further adjustment possibilities in this card card .
the map collection is used to set up all settings for your collection . this includes the folder and the type of the database for the collection .
&quot; here you can select the folder , which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for music files . to include a folder in the collection , mark the check box next to its name . this section also contains check boxes for setting up , as with selected folders . &quot;
search sub@@ folders recur@@ sively : this causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; both the cru@@ sts and their sub@@ folders are searched for music .
&quot; monitor changes : enables &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to monitor the selected folders for changes ( e.g. , if music files are added or deleted ) . in addition , an incre@@ mental search is performed to make the necessary changes to your collection . &quot;
im@@ porting play@@ lists : causes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; all found play@@ lists in your collections ( .@@ pl@@ s- and .@@ m@@ 3@@ u files ) are added to your collection . the automatically added play@@ lists will appear later in the play@@ lists browser .
&quot; the part collection database is used to select a database for the collection . the combination field driver : lets choose between SQ@@ Lite or My@@ S@@ q@@ l . if My@@ S@@ q@@ l is selected , another setup in the My@@ S@@ q@@ l sub@@ window is necessary . &quot;
&quot; the My@@ S@@ q@@ l setup section is used to set up the database for &amp; Amar@@ ok ; under Calcul@@ ator : enter the host on which the My@@ S@@ q@@ l database is located . after that , the network port is entered under which the database is reachable . name : is the database name to which the connection is established . &quot;
use User@@ name : and Password : to enter the data needed for connection to the database .
the cart@@ el card last@@ .@@ f@@ m sets the support for last@@ .@@ f@@ m . &amp; Amar@@ ok ; can transmit the names of played pieces to a last@@ .@@ f@@ m server and if necessary create music recommendations regarding the current piece .
&quot; here you enter your username and password for your Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile . if you do not have a profile , you can register one on the last@@ .@@ f@@ m website . &quot;
send the pieces played and update the profile : this setting allows you to transfer the names of the played pieces to your last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile .
you can view the list in the context @-@ browser . note : you do not need a last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile to use this function .
&amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an audio player for Unix systems ( such as &amp; z@@ b ; Linux ) . more information can be found in the summary of the functions and the gallery with screen@@ shots .
Amar@@ ok only needs the package k@@ deli@@ bs and otherwise no other K@@ DE packages . you need to have k@@ deli@@ bs so installed ( including the programs included in it because &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires some of them to find e.g. modules or scripts ) . we have written a small guide how to compile k@@ deli@@ bs minim@@ ally .
&quot; some functions such as O@@ SD require that your window manager is keeping the relevant standards of fre@@ ed@@ esk@@ top@@ .@@ or@@ g. Gn@@ ome will work , but flu@@ x@@ box will cause trouble , for example . we try to support Amar@@ ok on all platforms , so we use k@@ deli@@ bs and Q@@ t , because they provide an excellent development environment . &quot;
probably one of your files will make a mistake in the Tag@@ li@@ b library . you can locate the file in ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok / collection _ sc@@ an@@ .@@ log .
&quot; most of the time , it is because Tag@@ li@@ b crashes when reading the met@@ a information from this file . please report this error to the Tag@@ li@@ b developer at bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. &quot;
&quot; if you use MySQL as a database , try SQ@@ Lite . support for it in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a bit more mature . &quot;
&quot; make sure all of the used libraries have been compiled with the same comp@@ iler version . if e.g. &amp; Amar@@ ok ; with G@@ CC 3.4 , Tag@@ li@@ b but compiled with G@@ CC 3.@@ 3.@@ X , then this leads to crashes when editing met@@ a information . &quot;
&quot; if you use K@@ DE with ar@@ ts@@ d then disable autom@@ . turn off when in@@ active for ... in setting the sound system , or at least do not use a value of 1 second . &quot;
&quot; you can also send us the back@@ trace by e @-@ mail ( the e @-@ mail automatically opens with a crash ) . if it is a frequently occurring crash and you send us a good back@@ trace , the error is guaranteed . &quot;
&quot; this is because many programs write data as UT@@ F @-@ 8 in met@@ a @-@ information , but do not mark it as Uni@@ code . the following Perl script fixes the problem . &quot;
&quot; # ! / usr / bin / per@@ l &quot; &quot; The file $ AR@@ GV &#91; 0 &#93; ; my $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ mp@@ 3 &gt; get _ v@@ 2@@ tag ; $ v@@ 2@@ tag = $ v@@ 2@@ tag ( $ v@@ 2@@ tag , amp ; UT@@ F@@ 8 ) ; &quot;
this script needs the Perl module MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b . it can be re@@ installed using this command : Perl -@@ MC@@ PA@@ N -@@ e &apos; install MP3 : : M@@ p@@ li@@ b &apos;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s symbols in the status bar ( random mode / repetition / dynamic playlist ) are always active in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . this is a well known bug in K@@ DE 3.@@ 4.0 . sometimes , the symbol effects are simply forgotten . &quot;
if you get this error : icon look@@ up error : _ Z@@ N@@ 11@@ K@@ System Tra@@ y@@ 9@@ set@@ pixel ER@@ K@@ 7@@ Q@@ Pix@@ map then please check if Amar@@ ok is using the correct Q@@ t library . you can see this with ld@@ d &apos; which amar@@ ok@@ app &apos; _ BA@@ R _ gre@@ p q@@ t .
&quot; to fix this error , you may need to remove any col@@ li@@ ding Q@@ t version or modify / etc / ld@@ .@@ so@@ .@@ conf so that Amar@@ ok will find the correct version first . &quot;
most of the installation problems are easiest by using an expert your Unix or Linux distribution . you can also search for help with other users or the developers . use the forum and the I@@ RC under ir@@ c.@@ fre@@ en@@ ode@@ .net in the channel # Amar@@ ok .
Bug@@ z@@ illa is not suitable for searching for help . please enter only one error if you have something in the correction of a bug in Amar@@ ok itself .
after the start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; only appears an empty playlist . how do music pieces come in there ?
this is simple . use the file browser on the left and open the folder you want . then drag the files to the right part of the playlist .
&quot; to maintain the surface intui@@ tively , the start sub@@ window has been transformed into the statistics window . you will find it under Extras Statistics . &quot;
the meaning of these symbols has changed with Amar@@ ok 1.4 Fast For@@ ward : stars stand for evaluation by the user while the points are calculated automatically .
&quot; to rate pieces , the playlist must display the review column in the playlist . click anywhere in the new application column to select the review for a piece . you can also use the short commands Windows + &#91; 1 @-@ 5 &#93; . this also works when Amar@@ ok is in the background . &quot;
&quot; select the files you want to remove , then select Del@@ ete on your keyboard . or right @-@ click on your selection and then select From Play@@ list Rem@@ ove from the drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; drag a playlist file to the playlist with the mouse and drop it down there , just like you would do it with other files . that &apos;s how simple it is : - ) &quot;
&quot; in the tool@@ bar &apos;s tool@@ bar , right next to the Add button , you can save the playlist by clicking on it . &quot;
&quot; you probably don &apos;t have the program x@@ m@@ ms @-@ config . install the x@@ m@@ ms @-@ de@@ vel package and install &amp; Amar@@ ok ; new . look for lib@@ visual , this package contains many very nice visu@@ aliz@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; the E@@ quali@@ zer is located in the context menu ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . in addition , you can find it via the menu bar among extras E@@ quali@@ zer .... &quot;
&quot; no ! yes , that &apos;s true ! no ! &amp; Amar@@ ok ; uses a back@@ end independent approach , so the actual question of loud media types does support G@@ Stre@@ amer / x@@ ine / Arts / N@@ MM / MAS / K@@ DE@@ mm ? . as you see , we support pretty much every imagin@@ able audio format . G@@ Stre@@ amer can even de@@ code text and P@@ NG ! &quot;
&quot; maybe you can use F@@ ed@@ ora / Red Hat Linux , with which in default no MP3 decoder are included ( due to patent reasons ) . the solution : alt @-@ F@@ 2 , gg : Red@@ Hat mp3 k@@ de , input button &quot;
start the Ya@@ ST online update and install the &apos; Multimedia option Pack 1 &apos; . well ... &amp; Amar@@ ok ; plays MP3 &apos;s from : - )
&quot; if you use the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver with the Al@@ sa sink , the device must provide a mixer . a mixer allows several applications to use the device at the same time and simultaneously output audio . this can be achieved by a sound card with hardware mixer ( e.g. S@@ B@@ Live ) or through the d@@ mix module for al@@ sa ( software mixer ) . &quot;
&quot; the output of this command should help you to find the problem cause and a solution . for G@@ Stre@@ amer , you may need to specify a different ink ( e.g. sink @-@ sink ) . &quot;
&quot; do not forget that media need to be deco@@ ded first . you can &apos;t simply send an MP3 to AL@@ SA , you would just want to hear a white noise . G@@ Stre@@ amer is the best choice for most people if you &apos;re looking for a decoder with little overhead . G@@ Stre@@ amer reads the file , de@@ codes it and sends the PC@@ M data to AL@@ SA . just like X@@ M@@ MS . &quot;
&quot; X@@ M@@ MS also de@@ codes the data first . G@@ Stre@@ amer can print directly to AL@@ SA , just like x@@ ine . &quot;
use either the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver ( really great ! ) or optimize the settings of Arts . open Control Center Sound &amp; Multimedia Sound System . enable sound server with highest priority ( real @-@ time priority ) and increase the size of sound buffer ( warning - see next point of the FAQ ! ) . make sure the ar@@ ts@@ wra@@ pper su@@ id is set :
K@@ DE 3.@@ 2.@@ x has problems with K@@ DE@@ multimedia co@@ de@@ cs that can cause disturbed playback . read this error report . enlarge the sound buffer in your AL@@ SA setup file .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c can also help .
&quot; either do not use the Arts driver , but instead G@@ Stre@@ amer or x@@ ine , or install K@@ DE multimedia to get the faster Arts co@@ de@@ cs ( li@@ bar@@ ts _ mp@@ eg@@ li@@ b.@@ so &amp; etc ; ) . &quot;
&quot; use another driver ( the x@@ ine driver has been strongly optimized for Analy@@ zer ) , or decrease the size of the Arts buffer in the control center and sound &amp; multimedia , sound system . the smaller the buffer , the less dreams react the visu@@ aliz@@ ations . yes , this is a mistake , please help us to fix it . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , but if I want to switch to the G@@ Stre@@ amer driver , crashes &amp; Amar@@ ok ; AB . why ? &quot;
&quot; after installing G@@ Stre@@ amer , you need to register all components . register to register all G@@ Stre@@ amer components . &quot;
&quot; read the G@@ Stre@@ amer FAQ . if that doesn &apos;t help , you can also ask in the I@@ RC Channel # G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; try this ( finish Amar@@ ok before ! ) : - Lo@@ ad ff@@ m@@ peg , compile and install it . then run all ff@@ m@@ peg files in the module folder by G@@ Stre@@ amer ( you will find the module folder with Galerie @-@ config / G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ config ) and execute the follow @-@ register again . start now &amp; Amar@@ ok ; . &quot;
please report from bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .@@ or@@ g. if you have a complete list of proposals / wishes please send them to our mailing list : Amar@@ ok @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is an album of the British Mike Old@@ field . I like it very and find that the name sounds good . besides , the name contains the magic K ... : ) &quot;
&quot; thanks to D@@ CO@@ P , this is already possible . set an alarm in your calendar program and let the alarm command this command : d@@ co@@ p Amar@@ ok player play &quot;
&quot; this command lets &amp; Amar@@ ok ; start playing . make sure that &amp; Amar@@ ok ; runs before you go to bed , then you will have been awak@@ ened by the soft tones of music that you have stopped before going to bed . &quot;
how to get the current in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; current titles when you are on another computer ?
&quot; if a functioning SSH environment is present , you can proceed as follows . this command gives you the interpreter and title of the running part : SSH -@@ i ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA ih@@ re@@ IP d@@ co@@ p --@@ user ih@@ re@@ usable Amar@@ ok player now@@ Pla@@ ying &quot;
replace IP address with your IP and your username with your username . this assumes that your identification is present in the file ~ / .@@ s@@ sh / id _ R@@ SA .
&quot; the visu@@ aliz@@ ations can be separated from the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ window . to do this , press the keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will open in an independent window in the size changeable window . &quot;
the combination of C@@ trl + Right mouse button sets a piece in the click sequence into the queue . pressing the input button after searching in the playlist will play the first search result and reset the search .
&quot; OK , the player window and the playlist have tricky functions , but what about the icon in the system section of the control bar ? &quot;
&quot; with the &amp; R@@ MB@@ n , click on the title of a browser . in the context menu you can select which browser to display . &quot;
&quot; my personal folder $ HO@@ ME is on a NFS drive . after the start of Amar@@ ok , the collection database cannot be created and on the console many error messages appear . &quot;
the internal SQ@@ Lite database of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; does not work with NFS . either you need to link ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Amar@@ ok to a local drive or use Amar@@ o@@ ks MySQL support .
&quot; go to the wa@@ v folder , select a few pieces and drag them to the desired destination folder in a kon@@ quer@@ or window . for automatic encoding , take files from the folders mp3 or o@@ gg . &quot;
&quot; Q@@ String List values = query ( &quot; SE@@ LE@@ CT play@@ counter , cre@@ at@@ ed@@ ate , &quot; F@@ ROM statistics &quot; &quot; W@@ HER@@ E ur@@ l = &apos; % 1 &apos; ; &quot; ) .@@ ar@@ g ( escap@@ e@@ String ( ur@@ l ) ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; the more often the piece has been played , the less influence each individual evaluation has on the overall result . &quot;
&quot; you can enter the evaluation for a piece by clicking the right mouse button on a column heading in the play@@ lists window . then you can change the rating of a piece as well , as all other attributes also , by clicking the right mouse button on the piece and editing : select review or edit F@@ 2 . you can also edit the evaluation in the dialog metadata . &quot;
developers do not want you to present when you want to publish a stable version of Amar@@ ok . this means : K@@ DE packages have a fixed release plan that is not compatible with the short @-@ term planned plan of Amar@@ ok .
this is a new feature in Amar@@ ok which some users can also find annoying . de@@ activate the option icon when playing anim@@ ate in the General Settings .
the Analy@@ zer is part of the tool@@ bar . select setup tool@@ bars ... and take the desired changes there .
&quot; download a design , or create your own . install it under Amar@@ ok ... Ap@@ pear@@ ance context @-@ browser @-@ Design , click to install New Design .... &quot;
&quot; the icon was similar to the logo of War@@ p Graphics Inc . ( el@@ f@@ qu@@ est@@ .com ) , too . to avoid difficulties , it was removed . &quot;
cross @-@ section navigation area allows you to monitor &amp; check &amp; Amar@@ ok ; while browsing the kon@@ quer@@ or . start Kon@@ quer@@ or and press F@@ 9 to view the navigation pane . then click the Settings button ( top ) and select Add Amar@@ ok in the Fol@@ der Menu .
audi@@ os@@ c@@ rob@@ bler is a free service to be sent to the information on which pieces are played on an independent server . the service is free and you only need a free user name and password . audio c@@ rob@@ bler is fully supported by &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
&quot; if you wish to use AL@@ SA , please check the latest version available . old AL@@ SA versions have a lot of crashes and therefore a lot of bug reports . &quot;
probably &amp; Amar@@ ok ; compiled before you have installed x@@ ine or G@@ Stre@@ amer . therefore the . / configure routine does not compile these output modules . you need to re@@ configure and install Amar@@ ok ; re@@ configure and install .
&quot; now I &amp; Amar@@ ok ; re@@ installed , but the output modules still don &apos;t appear . and now ? &quot;
&quot; you probably need to use a distribution that distri@@ butes the development files separated from the actual program . although G@@ Stre@@ amer is installed , the necessary development files are missing . the same applies to x@@ ine , you have to install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . then you need to re@@ compile and install x@@ ine @-@ de@@ vel . &quot;
I get the error G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ CR@@ IT@@ ICA@@ L * * : factory for &apos; Ad@@ der &apos;@@ has no type .. How can I fix it ?
&quot; your version of G@@ Stre@@ amer was compiled with P@@ rel@@ inking , which is in@@ compatible with G@@ Stre@@ amer . you need to compile G@@ Stre@@ amer without P@@ rel@@ inking . a tip by mer@@ lin @-@ t@@ c : use no L@@ DF@@ LA@@ GS when you compile Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I get the error message There is no element present to handle the file &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audi@@ a / mp@@ 4 although the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad is installed .
&quot; to play mp@@ 4 or m@@ 4@@ a files with G@@ Stre@@ amer , the G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ quick@@ time module must also be installed next to G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ fa@@ ad . &quot;
you will receive the error There is no element present to handle the stream &apos;s mim@@ et@@ ype audio / m@@ peg .
&quot; you play an MP3 stream , but the module G@@ Stre@@ amer @-@ mad is not installed . install the module and then run it as system administrator . then restart Amar@@ ok . &quot;
I have a second sound card and use AL@@ SA . how can the second sound card be used with Amar@@ ok ?
setting up Amar@@ ok ... Audio output will give you the device . typical is e.g. h@@ w : 0 for the standard sound@@ card and h@@ w : 1 for the second .
here is an example of ~ / .@@ as@@ o@@ und@@ r@@ c on a machine with an onboard AC@@ 97 co@@ dec and a USB audio device :
p@@ cm@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type plug @-@ sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 0 &quot; ct@@ l@@ .@@ intel@@ 8@@ x@@ 0 { type h@@ w card 0 } p@@ cm@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type plug sla@@ ve@@ .@@ p@@ cm &quot; h@@ w : 1 &quot; } ct@@ l@@ .@@ us@@ b @-@ audio { type h@@ w card 1 }
&quot; in x@@ ine &apos;s setup dialog , type us@@ b @-@ audio and output is done on the USB sound card . so @-@ li@@ b takes care of converting the sample rate , channels and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use a virtual d@@ mix device , disable the check on sound@@ card supports m@@ map . &quot;
&quot; sorry , but the audio output with Arts is not supported . you may of course like to take this issue yourself ! if you want , you can become the new so much needed main@@ tainer for Arts : ) &quot;
&quot; listening to music should be quite simple ! for this reason , there is the setup wizard , which is shown at the first start of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if you want to upgrade your collection afterwards , or simply do not like the wizard , then this quick start guide will be a help . &quot;
&quot; to create a playlist is very simple . drag and drop items from the collection browser into the playlist . if you &apos;re happy with the playlist , you can save it with the help of the click of a playlist , and you will find this button in the tool@@ bar of the playlist window . &quot;
&quot; if you have own play@@ lists , you can add them to the playlist . to do this , press the Edit tool@@ bar . if the playlist is included in the folders of your collection and you have the option to import play@@ lists , then these play@@ lists are already in the tree view . &quot;
&quot; to play an audio CD , please select Ac@@ tions Audio CD in the menu bar . a file browser with multiple folders and the CD pieces will open in WAV format . drag the WAV files into the playlist and then press the playback button . &quot;
the audio CD function uses the protocol Audi@@ oc@@ d : / and is not compatible with all available drivers .
the burning function can also be found in the playlist . simply click on an entry with the right mouse button and follow the Bur@@ n menu . you have here various possibilities to burn a CD .
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; requires the installation of some software packages . the required packages are listed below . in addition , some additional packages are listed that make work with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; more pleasant . &quot;
&quot; if you install these packages via a package management system ( e.g. RPM or apt ) , you must also install the development versions of these packages ! &quot;
&quot; &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is a multi @-@ sided multimedia player . it offers many different ways to keep your music collection under control . like any normal multimedia player has also &amp; Amar@@ ok ; a player window with the most important functions . additionally , the play@@ lists window contains several browsers with which you can capture and browse your entire music collection . &quot;
&quot; this chapter explains how all the functions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; used , including creating a collection and a playlist . &quot;
&quot; the player window is your one click &amp; Amar@@ ok ; control center . at the top of the window , there is a scroll bar showing the currently running track or the current stream . directly below is the area , the playing time , bit rate and sam@@ pl@@ er@@ ate of the current piece . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the player window contains a selection of audio analy@@ zers , also under the running text display . you can change through the available analy@@ zer by clicking the left mouse button on the panel . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; Amar@@ ok ; -@@ Analy@@ zer can be separated from the player window . press d on your keyboard and the current analy@@ zer will appear in an independent , expanding window . &quot;
&quot; under the run@@ way display , the PL and E@@ Q buttons are also activated . the PL button activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the play@@ lists window , while the E@@ Q button is used to direct equ@@ ali@@ zer . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the player window consists of playback buttons , the volume control and the play position slider . use the slider to adjust the play position or volume . use the playback buttons to start / stop playback and switch to the next or previous piece . &quot;
&quot; using the built @-@ in equ@@ ali@@ zer is simple and works with all audio drivers . there are 17 pres@@ ets , from classic to techn@@ o , and you can easily create your own pres@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; to view the equ@@ ali@@ zer , use extras E@@ quali@@ zer from the main menu or click the E@@ Q button in the player window . once you select the E@@ quali@@ zer check box , the equ@@ ali@@ zer is in operation . &quot;
&quot; the playlist of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; is the most developed playlist of all available for &amp; k@@ de ; available multimedia players . it has many features that there is no other player . but don &apos;t let the wealth of features stop you , they are all easy to use . &quot;
&quot; you can split the play@@ lists window into two main areas , on the left side is the navigation pane . in the navigation pane , you will find some of the excellent features of the playlist , such as the context browser . &quot;
&quot; the context @-@ browser displays different information regarding the current piece . its appearance can be adapted with the help of context @-@ browser designs . the context @-@ browser contains three sub@@ windows : music , text and interpretation . &quot;
&quot; if you have already used earlier versions of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; you may notice that the sub @-@ window has dropped off . the information presented there are now divided into other parts of &amp; Amar@@ ok ; furthermore , the information in the statistics window can be viewed ( Extras Statistics ) . &quot;
&quot; the music sub@@ window displays information about the currently running piece , as well as the performer and the album . &quot;
&quot; the first area in this sub @-@ window shows information about the piece . in the title is the name of the piece , performer and the album . below you see the cover image of the album and next to it a Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol . click on this icon to post the piece in the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z database . &quot;
under the Musi@@ c@@ Bra@@ in@@ z symbol you will find further information about the current piece . you can see how often and when the piece was played for the first and last time as well as its evaluation .
&quot; the images may have any name , but images with the word front in the name are treated preferred . the context browser will also display cover images that have either been downloaded with the cover management or embedded in ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
&quot; the next section , Recommen@@ ded pieces , lists several recommended pieces . if you click on one of these pieces , it will be played immediately . &quot;
among the Recommen@@ ded pieces are the favorite pieces of this artist . this area shows the top five scores of the current interpreter .
you can set which information is to be displayed in the music sub@@ window . right @-@ click anywhere in the sub @-@ window and select from the context menu .
&quot; the last section , albums of the performer , lists all the albums of the current artist you have in your collection . if you click on an album , it will be opened and you will see the content of the album . &quot;
you can click on all the pieces in the single areas to start playing right away . you can also click on it with the right mouse button and select one of the options for adding the piece or album to the playlist from the context menu .
&quot; in the sub@@ window text , the downloaded song text will be displayed for the current piece . this feature is very flexible and it is possible to download texts from other websites using the written scripts . as soon as you click on the text sub@@ window , try &amp; Amar@@ ok ; to download the text for the piece from the Internet . if you do not yet run a text script , you can choose which should be started . &quot;
the Edit button enables you to edit the lyrics . the modified version is then stored in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s collection database . no running text script is required .
the Find button opens a search on goo@@ gle@@ .com after the song text for the running piece ( in an external browser window ) .
&quot; group Interpre@@ t - group only the top level , each piece is displayed directly below the performer . albums or genres are dis@@ regarded . &quot;
&quot; group Interpre@@ t / Album - In addition , the pieces are arranged according to the performer and a further division is performed after the respective album . if you want to see compositions or soundtrack albums , this is the best view of your collection - these albums are displayed at the beginning of the list under Mis@@ cell@@ aneous interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; group interpreter / year - album - Sor@@ ted to performer and then after the year of the album in descending order ( the latest first ) . if the year is unknown for an album , the default 0 - album name is related . &quot;
group@@ ing album - All albums of your collection are sorted alphabe@@ tically among each other . the interpreter will be ignored .
group@@ ing genre / artist - your pieces will be sorted by genre and among them by interpreter .
&quot; group@@ ing genre / artist / album - this setting works just like the above , but is additionally sorted by album below the performer . &quot;
&quot; using the remaining buttons , you can customize and combine group@@ ing at will . &quot;
&quot; with the last button , you can change the settings to the collection . note : &amp; Amar@@ ok ; will automatically capture your collection once you change something on selected folders . if you own many pieces , this might take a while . &quot;
right under the tool@@ bar there is a search filter . it is the same in the list view as well as in the construction view . instructions for using this filter can be found in the section to the playlist in this manual .
&quot; under the search filter there is a selection box , which allows you to filter the most recently added pieces to your collection . you can also select different time windows , starting from the last 24 hours up to one year . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the right mouse button on an entry in the collection browser , you will receive the following options . &quot;
load - This lists the current playlist and inserts the selected pieces in the currently valid order to play .
attach to playlist - Add the selected pieces of the current playlist . by double @-@ clicking on an entry you can reach the same effect .
set pieces in queue - This function adds the selected pieces to the queue . this will be played next .
save as a playlist ... - Save the selected pieces as a playlist . you will be asked for a name in which the list is to be saved .
&quot; transferred to media player - Add the pieces to the queue for transferring to the media player . for more details , see the section on the Media Player Browser . &quot;
&quot; burn all pieces of this interpreter / Bur@@ n CD - This will send the selected pieces to K@@ 3@@ b and burn either as a data or as an audio CD . if K@@ 3@@ b is not installed , this option is not displayed . &quot;
edit metadata ( for n pieces ) ... - Op@@ ens the dialog for piece information and lets you change the tags for one or more pieces .
&quot; ( n ) Move files in the sleeves ... - Op@@ ens a confirmation dialog . if you confirm this , the selected files will be deleted from your computer . &quot;
&quot; mark the composition - Select the selected album as a composition , wher@@ eu@@ pon it appears in different interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the album will be shown no longer under different interpre@@ ters , but again under the corresponding interpre@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; the play@@ lists browser makes it easy to handle a lot of play@@ lists . among other things , he also includes Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists . &quot;
the lower part of the play@@ lists web browser contains the smart play@@ lists . these use &amp; Amar@@ ok ; s built @-@ in database to automatically create some useful play@@ lists at run@@ time . the smart play@@ lists consist of :
never played : a playlist with the pieces in your collection that have never been played .
&quot; even created Intel@@ ligent play@@ lists are possible . click Intel@@ ligent playlist to open the dialog to create a new Smart Play@@ list , where you can enter all the necessary criteria for your new playlist . &quot;
&quot; the Media Player sub@@ window is used to connect &amp; Amar@@ ok ; for example , use your portable media player ( e.g. iPod ) . for example , to use your iPod with &amp; Amar@@ ok ; if &amp; Amar@@ ok ; started , you will find the pieces on your iPod to performer sort in the top list view of the media player browser . &quot;
&quot; to transfer pieces to your iPod , drag the desired titles from the playlist and drop them to the list interpreter . if you are done , click App@@ ly . this will upload the pieces to your iPod . when the transfer is complete , finish &amp; Amar@@ ok ; and release the drive connection for your iPod . &quot;
&quot; under the tool@@ bar there is a search area that you can search for a file . the search is especially useful in folders with very many files , because in the file list all files are hidden which do not match your search criteria . &quot;
&quot; in the lower part of the file browser there is a address bar that lets you pick music from a given URL . if you enter for example tar : / home / mi@@ ke / musi@@ c.@@ tar@@ .@@ g@@ z and press En@@ ter , you can drag and drop music from there into the playlist . &quot;
&quot; if the playlist is longer than in the window , the connection of files can be tricky by simply dropping the shift key . in this case , the holding down of the Shift key can be helpful : this will automatically insert dropped files at the end of the list , and not at the mouse position . &quot;
&quot; the playlist contains all pieces attached to you to play . you can change the order by simply dra@@ gging the entries with the mouse to the desired location . once you enter letters , you will only see the pieces that contain the letters . to reset the filter , press the button until the text field is empty again . &quot;
&quot; if you enter search terms separated by whit@@ esp@@ ace , search &amp; Amar@@ ok ; search for entries containing all search terms . for example , if you enter one or two three , the search will find all entries containing one , two and three . &quot;
&quot; for example : one OR two OR three . in this example , all pieces that contain one or two or three ( or a combination thereof ) will be found . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for entries containing spaces , then en@@ close the search term with ge@@ ese feet : Mike Old@@ field . this will search for entries that contain Mike Old@@ field , but not for entries like Mike J. Old@@ field . &quot;
&quot; if you indicate a specific search column , you can also search for larger or smaller ones . for example : rating : &gt; 50 . this looks for pieces that have a higher rating than 50 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to search for a piece that does not contain a particular search term , set a minus sign before the search term : -@@ something searches for pieces that do not contain anything . &quot;
example : Mike Old@@ field OR score : &gt; 50 -@@ comment : bad . this looks for all the pieces that either contain Mike Old@@ field or have a higher rating than 50 and do not include the comment bath .
&quot; you can set the sequence of entries by pressing the C@@ trl key , and then right @-@ click in the desired order to the entries . the entries will then be marked with a number . the number corresponds to the order in which the pieces are played . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar tool@@ bar is located at the bottom of the playlist . it contains buttons for some features of the playlist . on the left you will find the Add button to add the playlist to the playlist . to the right , you can save play@@ lists , empty play@@ lists and assign them . &quot;
&quot; next , the buttons will follow undo and restore . this allows you to undo or restore changes to the playlist . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the tool@@ bar there is a unique , enlarged analy@@ zer . the refresh rate can be adjusted with a click of the right mouse button on the analy@@ zer . &quot;
the last button in the tool@@ bar is menu . it opens the same menu as that you can see in the player window above the right mouse button . via this menu you can set up and Amar@@ ok ; &apos;s configuration .
&quot; there are many more buttons available for the tool@@ bar , for example playback controls and volume control . &quot;
&quot; the status bar displays the title of the current piece , the number of pieces and the total playing time of all pieces . furthermore , the status for random mode and retri@@ eval is displayed by clicking the mouse twice in the corresponding display area . &quot;
&quot; you can also hide the status bar . to do this , disable the status bar flag in the General Settings . &quot;
&quot; the context menu can be reached by clicking the right mouse button in the player window , or by clicking in the playlist on the menu . &quot;
a click on this entry will open the Visu@@ alization plugin window . there you can select the visu@@ al@@ isations of &amp; Amar@@ ok ;
behind this entry there is a sub @-@ menu with links to this document and other information to &amp; Amar@@ ok ; .
the cover administration is a useful tool for managing your cover images . you can start them by selecting actions cover management in the collection browser .
the cover management contains a list view of all albums in your collection . you can view all the albums of an artist in your collection by choosing the performer on the left side .
&quot; with the View menu , you can choose what to display in the cover administration . select from : &quot;
&quot; the queue management received your big entry in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; 1.3 . with this feature , you have even more control over the playlist . after you have set a piece into the queue , the playlist will display one number next to the title . this number represents the order in which &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the pieces will play : 1 is played first , 2 as second , and so on . &quot;
&quot; if you want to add a piece to the queue , select the piece in the playlist and then click + . you can also simply add the pieces with the mouse or use the context menu in the playlist . you can then change the order of the pieces in the queue management . &quot;
&quot; there are three types of dynamic play@@ lists , two of which are pre @-@ given ( the details to set up these play@@ lists later ) . &quot;
fill your playlist with random pieces from your entire collection and add other random pieces during playback .
adds pieces based on Last@@ .@@ f@@ m recommendations ( formerly : audio c@@ rob@@ bler ) . this mode requires that some pieces are already in your playlist . you do not need a Last@@ .@@ f@@ m profile for this dynamic playlist to work .
&quot; double @-@ click on the playlist you want , drag it to the play@@ lists window or click with the right mouse button on you and then select Lo@@ ad . in this way , your current playlist will be replaced by the new one . so you should save the old playlist under certain circumstances ! &quot;
&quot; the two pre @-@ set modes of random mix and playlist blend immediately fill your playlist and you can start playing directly . the playlist &apos;s recommended pieces will start with an empty playlist and you must add at least one piece from your collection . the recommended pieces will be added to the next piece of play , so your playlist will only be filled at the end of the first piece . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the current playlist , activate the last possible dynamic mode : settings Dynamic Mode . this will use your existing playlist as a starting point . using the same menu entry , the dynamic mode can also be de@@ activated again . &quot;
&quot; the New button adds the current playlist and adds new pieces in line with the dynamic mode . edit playlist opens the dialog to edit the playlist , and you can change the corresponding settings . &quot;
&quot; with a right click on a dynamic playlist , you have the option to click Edit . this will open the dialog to edit the playlist settings . &quot;
&quot; enter any name for the playlist here . however , the name should be unique to avoid confusion . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is not active , your playlist will continue to grow , the setting for upcoming pieces will be ignored and they will not be dup@@ lic@@ ated in this playlist . however , if the setting is active , the pieces already played are removed while adher@@ ing to the settings . &quot;
&quot; played pieces - this is the number of pieces played at the beginning of the playlist , allowing you to easily see which pieces were recently played . &quot;
&quot; this is the number of pieces that are to be added to the playlist after each piece played . if you set more than 1 here , the playlist will continuously grow because only one piece can be played and removed . &quot;
&quot; the settings on the right have already been described in the previous section . on the left side of the dialog you can select existing play@@ lists or smart play@@ lists . if you have multiple play@@ lists , add &amp; Amar@@ ok ; random pieces from each of the play@@ lists inter@@ sec@@ ted . &quot;
some scripts make your own settings . you can adjust the settings by starting the script and then click Con@@ figuration .
&quot; you can install new &amp; Amar@@ ok ; scripts , by clicking on the script . it will open a selection dialog to install a script package to install . you can also install new scripts directly from the Internet . &quot;
&quot; if you do not wish to use a script for longer , you can delete it . to do so , select the script to be deleted , then click Un@@ install . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for information on how to write your own scripts , please refer to the Script section . &quot;
&quot; the dialog window visualization plug @-@ in is used to enable available visu@@ al@@ isations in &amp; Amar@@ ok ; the window contains a list of all available plu@@ gins . to use a plug @-@ in , simply activate the check box next to the name . &quot;
&quot; this Quick Start guide should show you how to create an audio CD in four steps . to understand the steps , you need to have a running installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and have a folder with audio files . &quot;
this is a dialog box where you can select which files you want to burn to CD .
&quot; if you want to burn an audio CD of MP3 or other los@@ sy compressed formats , remember that when you re @-@ encoding to MP3 , you will receive a worse quality , no matter how high the bit@@ rate is . you can check if an audio CD is created by a los@@ sy format . &quot;
&quot; in this dialog box , you can do nothing . please wait until the calcul@@ ator has finished the burning process . &quot;
&quot; this quick guide should show you how to copy with &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; copy a data CD in just four steps . in order to understand the steps , you need to have a flu@@ ffy installation of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; have and put the source CD into the CD @-@ Rom drive . &quot;
&quot; to copy a data CD , please choose Extras , copy CD ... from the menu . you will now see a dialog with the possible settings for burning . &quot;
&quot; after you have done all &amp; k@@ 3@@ b settings , press the Start button . you will now see a dialog that looks like this : &quot;
&quot; in this dialog window , you can track the progress of the copy process . once the origin@@ als are read into the image file , you will be asked for an empty CD medium where the data should be burned . &quot;

&amp; c@@ dr@@ da@@ o ; : this program will burn audio or data CD R@@ s in a run ( also called disk @-@ at @-@ once mode or DA@@ O ) based on a tex@@ tual description of the CD content ( TO@@ C file ) .
&quot; &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; / m@@ kis@@ ofs ; : burns all kinds of CD @-@ R@@ s . &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; has all features that also offers &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; hence , select &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; usually automatically &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; for burning CDs . in some cases , it reaches &amp; c@@ d@@ record ; however , a higher quality in burned audio CDs . &quot;
c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia : a program for reading digital audio data from a CD ( CD@@ DA - Compact Disc Digital Audio ) .
O@@ GG Vor@@ bis Library : O@@ GG Vor@@ bis is a completely open and patent @-@ free and professional audio encoding technology . O@@ GG Vor@@ bis benefits from open source and is in direct competition to MP3 . this library is used by O@@ gg Vor@@ bis deco@@ ders and enco@@ der modules .
&quot; M@@ ad : this is a high quality MPEG @-@ 1 audio decoder . it currently supports MPEG @-@ 1 , MPEG @-@ 2 and MPEG 2.5 . all three audio layers Layer I , Layer II , and Layer III ( e.g. MP3 ) are fully supported . this library is used by the MP3 decoder module . &quot;
l@@ ame : a well developed MP3 decoder that can compete in terms of quality and speed with commercial enco@@ ders . l@@ ame is used by the MP3 enco@@ der module .
FLA@@ C : a free open source co@@ dec for los@@ s@@ less audio compression and de@@ compression . it is used by the FLA@@ C decoder module and the external audio enco@@ der module so you can read and write FLA@@ C files .
&quot; Li@@ bs@@ n@@ d@@ file , FF@@ MPEG , FLA@@ C , Mus@@ ep@@ ack Decoder : additional libraries for processing various audio formats . with FF@@ MPEG it is possible , for example , to de@@ cryp@@ t WMA files to burn them on an audio CD . de@@ co &quot;
SO@@ X : an aid program that can convert and convert between different audio formats . SO@@ X is used by the So@@ X Audio En@@ co@@ der module .
trans@@ code : a command line program for video processing . you need it if you want to read a DVD .
&quot; V@@ C@@ DI@@ E@@ ger : a full featured auth@@ oring system for editing , dis@@ assembling and analy@@ sing video CDs and super video CDs . &quot;
&quot; norm@@ alize : this tool is used to adjust the volume of music files to a standard stage . this can , for example , be useful for creating mixed CD &apos;s and M@@ p@@ 3 collections ; without norm@@ alize , the different recording levels of the different albums can lead to the unpleasant effects that the music pieces can be played differently . &quot;
e@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x : this is a very small Linux distribution . it contains the necessary software to boot from CD and automatically playback all videos in the base folder of the CD .
this is a convenient method to rel@@ o@@ ad recently opened projects . the related sub @-@ menu contains a list of these projects . one click on one entry will open the project .
&quot; save the current project . once the project has been saved , the previously created file will be over@@ written , otherwise it will be asked for a new file name . &quot;
save the current project under a new fil@@ en@@ ame . K@@ DE &apos;s dialog Save As is displayed to select folder and file name for the project file .
saves all opened projects . this is the same as you would call for each individual project file save .
&quot; if a project has changed and has not yet been saved , ask &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after what is to happen . you can then drop between Save and Change . in addition , you can also cancel the closing and keep the project open . &quot;
&quot; close all opened projects . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; will ask for each project that is not saved , just as if you had called for each project file closing . &quot;
closes all opened projects and quit &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; . for each un@@ saved project you will be asked what to do with it as if you had called file closing .
&quot; when you call this entry , you can select files to add to the project via the appearing dialog . this has the same effect as when you move the files directly from the top view into the project view . if the current project is a data CD , the files added in the base folder appear in the base folder of the CD . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog &quot; &quot; Bur@@ n &quot; &quot; for the current project . this dialogue is basically the same as the properties dialog of the project . the only difference is the additional button burning , the &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; for burning the medium , the burning dialogue can only be opened if the project already contains data . &quot;
&quot; opens the Properties dialog for the current project . here you can make many project @-@ related settings . each project type has different possible settings , most of them are described above the What is the ? -@@ help described ( accessible via the right mouse button ) . &quot;
this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . it causes files from a previous session to import into the current project . this is useful when you have files for a multi @-@ session CD . it &apos;s useful for you to see the files and folders already existing on the medium .
&quot; this entry will only appear on an active data CD / DVD or video DVD project . this function causes files from the current project to be removed . all other files remain in the project . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to copy a CD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a CD that you can then burn later on . you should also prefer cl@@ oning instead of the normal copy . you should also prefer cl@@ oning if you want to copy CDs with defective sectors or video CDs . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to copy a DVD to another medium without a project file . alternatively , you can only create a copy of a DVD , which you can then burn later on . furthermore , the target medium must be large enough to accommodate the entire ( video ) data of the source medium in its original form . &quot;
&quot; opens the dialog to delete a CD @-@ RW , so you can delete the entire content or parts of a CD @-@ RW . &quot;
&quot; open the dialog for format@@ ting a DVD . with this dialog you can format a DVD ± R ( W ) , whereby the content is completely deleted . &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; lets you choose between the write modes over@@ writing and incre@@ mental . &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created CD image . the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso , * .@@ cue or * .@@ to@@ c file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the burning button . ( Ner@@ os * .@@ n@@ r@@ g files are not currently supported , but you need to use other tools such as N@@ r@@ g@@ 2@@ I@@ so . ) &quot;
&quot; burn a previously created DVD image . the dialog asks you for an * .@@ iso file as a source of data , which can then be burned immediately by pressing the pressing button . &quot;
&quot; this dialog box usually appears after reading a DVD in the table of contents , but can also be used as stand @-@ alone . it contains information about the loaded video , encoding settings and even options for changing the size and cutting black edges . &quot;
&quot; this information is displayed in the table of contents and includes properties of the medium , such as size and title length of CD or DVD . &quot;
&quot; shows a list of tool@@ bars by &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; if one entry is checked , the tool@@ bar is currently visible in the main window . &quot;
&quot; if this is checked , a small bar will appear at the bottom of the window . it contains information about the status of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; and its activities . if this is not checked , the status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; the folder view displays an overview of your folders and CD / DVD drives . if the contents view is enabled , their contents are displayed in the contents view . CD / DVD drives also have a context menu with functions such as Media @-@ Info , locking and blocking the drive or ej@@ ecting the medium . &quot;
&quot; the Content View allows you to select and drag files into the project view . the content view is also the interface for reading audio or video CDs , if a drive has been selected with a corresponding CD / DVD in the folder view . &quot;
&quot; the header is a narrow section that is only visible when the project view contains open projects . the header does not have a real function , it only looks pretty and separates the project view clearly from the rest of the views . &quot;
&quot; this opens a dialog box for changing the key assignments for &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; after you have selected one of the available commands in the upper part , you can adjust the key assignments further down . &quot;
&quot; this will start the k@@ 3@@ b ; setup wizard . this allows you to set the correct per@@ missions for burning CDs and DVDs . for this , you need to enter the system administrator rights , so you must enter the password for the system administrator ( root ) when you start the wizard . &quot;
opens the settings of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; here general application settings can be made . almost all functions of &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; should work at first . this dialog is intended for person@@ alization and for fine adjustment of the program .
&quot; &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; is , like many others &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ applications also equipped with a &amp; D@@ CO@@ P interface . with the help of this interface , parts of the functionality can be controlled via a shell script . &quot;
&quot; to use the &amp; D@@ CO@@ P functions , you can either use the command line program d@@ co@@ p , or the somewhat more convenient program K@@ d@@ co@@ p . both programs are identical in the functionality , so your taste and the type of your task are decisive in which the enclosed programs give you the default . &quot;
&quot; in this chapter , we assume that you use the command line program d@@ co@@ p . to use the d@@ co@@ p command line , you must first make sure that &amp; k@@ 3@@ b is started . then enter something like the following on the console : &quot;
&quot; besides the general &amp; D@@ CO@@ P ; functions that all have common , support &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; mainly two other parts described below . &quot;
&quot; the standard D@@ CO@@ P interface from &amp; k@@ 3@@ b ; features functions such as copy@@ CD , format@@ ted DVD and other functions for creating new projects . &quot;
D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ DV@@ D@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( ) D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f cre@@ ate@@ Mo@@ vi@@ x@@ CD@@ Project ( )
&quot; as a result of such a cre@@ ate@@ XX@@ X@@ Project method , you get a D@@ CO@@ P reference to the newly created project : D@@ CO@@ P@@ Re@@ f ( k@@ 3@@ b , K@@ 3@@ b@@ Project @-@ 0 ) Altern@@ atively you can create a project via the command line : # k@@ 3@@ b --@@ audi@@ oc@@ d and then obtain a reference to the project using the # d@@ co@@ p k@@ 3@@ b K@@ 3@@ b@@ Interface curr@@ ent@@ Project . using this reference it is possible to change the project via K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface . &quot;
K@@ 3@@ b offers the listed K@@ 3@@ b@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface and the powerful K@@ 3@@ b@@ Data@@ Proj@@ ect@@ Interface that can only be used on data projects ( CD and DVD ) :
&quot; void cre@@ ate@@ Fol@@ der ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ String name , Q@@ String parent ) void add@@ ur@@ l ( Q@@ String Path ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String ) void ren@@ am@@ e@@ It@@ em ( Q@@ String Path , Q@@ String New@@ Name ) void set@@ Volume ID ( Q@@ String id ) &quot;
&quot; for example , the following script creates a data project , several folders and then add files to the new folder : &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is an audio CD ; reader for &amp; knots ; with it can easily be read audio CD ; s can be read out and stored in MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG files . also other formats are possible , depending on the enco@@ der that is installed on the computer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; is the user interface of c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia ( for reading &amp; CD ; -@@ data in wa@@ v files on hard disk ) and supported by many coding files ( compressed ) . currently l@@ ame for MP3 , o@@ ye c for O@@ g@@ gs and FLA@@ C ( los@@ s@@ less compression ) is currently supported ( These enco@@ der packages must still be added from the Linux distribution ) . more enco@@ ders can be added to the program ( if they have been installed ) . &quot;
first the tracks of the &amp; CD ; read out and stored in wa@@ v files on the computer ( los@@ s@@ less and compressed ) ; and then
&quot; in a second step these wa@@ v files ( usually one per cap@@ tion ) are compressed into the MP@@ 3- or O@@ GG format , or also in other formats like the los@@ s@@ less FLA@@ C . &quot;
&quot; for the first step , reading the &amp; CD ; , is used by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . almost every distribution has compiled a pre @-@ compiled package ; if this is not yet installed , this must be done now . &quot;
&quot; for the second step , l@@ ame ( for MP3 ) , o@@ gg@@ vor@@ bis ( for O@@ GG ) or other enco@@ ders must be installed . &quot;
&quot; which encoding / file format should be used ? the chapter Which enco@@ der gives a little introduction about enco@@ ders , audio quality and compression factors . &quot;
&quot; a word to copy protected audio CD ; s : as already said , used &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia for reading the audio data from the &amp; CD ; this program is not intended to b@@ ypass any copy protection . if not the firmware of the &amp; CD ; / DVD device does not b@@ ypass the protection , you can simply avoid buying copy @-@ protected audio CD ; s ! &quot;
&quot; while setup has to be done only once ( the setup dialog can be called as often until a suitable configuration is found ) , the daily use for reading a &amp; CD is explained . this leads ( hopefully ) to understand the lean approach of the user interface , which you will often stum@@ ble at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; can convert to many formats - depending on which enco@@ der programs are installed ( MP3 , O@@ GG , FLA@@ C &amp; etc ; ) &quot;
&quot; can &amp; CD ; fetch information from the fre@@ ed@@ b from the Internet or can work completely without a network , whereby everything is recorded manually . &quot;
this is just a short list of the main window commands . on the page step by step example you will find more information about how this program is used and screen@@ shots with descriptions of the tab@@ s for the configuration of the program .
&quot; the C@@ DD@@ B requests the CD @-@ data according to the setup of request in the C@@ DD@@ B tab . ( this can be local or online , in the latter case the connection to the internet must first be established . ) &quot;
starts reading and - when an enco@@ der is configured in the encoding settings in the Setup dialog - the encoding .
&quot; opens a sub @-@ menu with a list of the available enco@@ der , so that the selection can be read with a different enco@@ der than the default . it is to be noted that the enco@@ der was configured in the Setup dialog before the encoding settings . &quot;
&quot; opens the file manager , so that an already read file is selected to code instead of a complete &amp; CD ; read and code . &quot;
&quot; opens the setup dialog to configure the type of noti@@ fications ( such as protocols , pi@@ ep@@ ses ) for program events ( such as reading the &amp; CD ; finishes ) . &quot;
&quot; opens the main setup dialog by &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; with different card cards ( like En@@ co@@ der , for setting up the enco@@ der ) . here you have to go before the program can be used successfully ! &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes sound quality , enco@@ ders and compression ratios and helps you choose the correct coding . &quot;
&quot; if no audio information is to be lost , a los@@ s@@ less audio format is required . besides FLA@@ C , there are also other such as &apos; shor@@ ten &apos; or &apos; monkey &apos; , which may be available for this distribution . the disadvantages are the low compression rates and hardly available commercial devices that can reproduce these files . &quot;
&quot; among the audio formats that lose information through data compression depending on their psycho@@ acoustic model , MP3 and O@@ GG are the most common . O@@ GG may today have a slight advantage over MP3 in the audio quality at lower bit@@ rates ( up to 128 k@@ bps ) , but above this bit rate differences are less important , since both enco@@ ders produce very good audio quality . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Not so &apos; free , l@@ ame is still supplied free with most distri@@ butions , but there are open license issues &quot;
&quot; + high to very high quality ( at high bit@@ rates ) , but compared with O@@ GG slightly lower quality at lower bit@@ rates . &quot;
O@@ GG - if only music is to be heard from a computer or computer based music system and / or if one of the few existing O@@ GG playback devices is available .
&quot; MP3 - if music is also to be heard on other devices , such as standard DVD player , portable devices ( USB stick , memory card , hard drive ) or special auto stereo systems . today - initially 2009 - these devices mostly support only the MP3 format . &quot;
a short list of audio quality parameters and resulting compression ratios for &apos; l@@ ame &apos; ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) ( see &apos; l@@ ame --@@ help &apos; for more parameters ) :
&apos;@@ - pres@@ et medium &apos; = This setting gives good transparency for most people and most of the music
&quot; &apos; pres@@ et Standard &apos; = This setting should usually provide acceptable transparency for most people and most music pieces , and has quite high quality . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; = 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps V@@ BR , compression rate up to 6.3 . needs up to 320 k@@ bps for complex music pieces and less for less complex parts of the piece . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . this is the preferred choice . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme -@@ b 256 &apos; = 256 k@@ bps DS@@ LR , compression rate about 5.5 . needs always 256 k@@ bps for complex and less complex pieces of a title . some older devices need C@@ BR@@ s . good enough for hi @-@ fi stereo systems with high quality . &quot;
&quot; -@@ h &apos; = 128 k@@ bps C@@ BR common stereo , compression rate about 11 128 k@@ bps for all pieces of a title . good Gen@@ u@@ g for music of young people , portable devices and auto stere@@ os . but not good enough for better HiFi stereo systems . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et In@@ san@@ e &apos; = 3@@ 20@@ k@@ bps C@@ BR . this setting will be exagger@@ ated for most people and most environments , but if you absolutely want to have absolutely highest quality without regard to the file size , then choose this setting . &quot;
the &amp; CD ; information that is manually entered or downloaded by the program automatically from the fre@@ ed@@ b via the Internet are available in the program as a list of parameters . you can commit / need / used with &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and the encoding program to create the folder and file names as well as the properties of the music files .
&quot; in connection with coding programs , there is often a combination of program settings for the enco@@ der and these parameters here . the manual or help to the enco@@ ders explain the switches for these programs . &quot;
&quot; for example , to add the title to the keywords ( English : tag ) when MP@@ 3@@ s are enco@@ ded with l@@ ame , the switch -@@ t@@ t of l@@ ame and the title parameter of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; the result looks like this : &apos; ... -@@ t@@ t { title } ... &apos; . &quot;
this is a summary of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; parameters which can be used ( = button name in the wizard ) :
&quot; this is what fre@@ ed@@ b is : a free database where people can read the audio CDs that can download / input the information instead of entering the computer itself . it is to be noted that here only text is spoken : &amp; CD ; Tit@@ le , artist , name of pieces &amp; etc ; , not from the audio file itself . &quot;
&quot; yes , it should be legal , but I ( note of the translator : that is the author ) bin not lawyer . however , no one can prevent you from the &amp; CD ; any information that is publicly available on the &amp; CD ; no more or less worth@@ less , so neither the artist nor the music company can be har@@ med . all information can be obtained by a stroll through a &amp; CD ; business , physical or virtual . &quot;
&quot; in this type of configuration , it appears that the e @-@ mail address is not used when retri@@ eving the data from the server ( but this can only know the program@@ mer who has checked the code . ) &quot;
&quot; there are copies of the main database in many countries . if &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; to use fre@@ ed@@ b , the ge@@ ographi@@ cally closest mirror server should be used . this saves bandwidth on the network and balances the load between the hosts . &quot;
a visit to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org provides a current list of mirror servers for online retri@@ eval of &amp; CD ; information during reading a &amp; CD ; alternatively the complete database can be downloaded or ( usually created monthly ) only the updates of the database .
which read@@ out program is used to store pieces from the &amp; CD ; to save to WAV files on my computer ?
&quot; there are rum@@ ors that c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia is used ; those who want to know more precisely , search in the source code .... This was always the best choice for reading audio CD ; s . please note that the c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia package from the appropriate distribution must first be installed if this has not yet been done . &quot;
&quot; for the first opening are pre @-@ defined entries for l@@ ame ( MP@@ 3@@ s ) , o@@ ggen@@ c ( O@@ g@@ gs ) and FLA@@ C ( a los@@ s@@ less compression for audio data ) on the tab for setting up the encoding . other enco@@ ders can be added on this tab . &quot;
the enco@@ der package must be installed by the respective Linux distribution before the enco@@ der can be used . this is also required for the pre@@ defined enco@@ ders . more information on enco@@ ders are available in the chapter Wel@@ cher Ko@@ di@@ ers .
&quot; after installing a coding , more information can be obtained via its switches by entering a command such as l@@ ame -@@ help or l@@ ame --@@ help in a console window ( eg ; console ) . &quot;
&quot; check the device name of the &amp; CD ; / DVD drive , read / write real on it and whether both c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia and the audio enco@@ ders of your choice ( l@@ ame for MP@@ 3@@ s , o@@ ggen@@ c for O@@ g@@ gs , fla@@ c &amp; etc ; ) are installed . &quot;
check if you don &apos;t want a copy @-@ protected audio CD ; please check the cover of the CD ; this will not succeed !
&quot; there is a chapter with a step by step example . even if you use other settings , this can give tips on how to proceed . &quot;
&quot; have you read the complete manual , understood everything , but are somehow still unsure what to do ? well , no problem , follow this step @-@ by @-@ step example , and you will get enough information to set up those areas that make the program exactly what you want . &quot;
&quot; in this example , we will start the program for the first time , setup everything and read our first &amp; CD ; we will use l@@ ame &apos; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; to generate MP@@ 3@@ s with a V@@ BR ( variable bit@@ rate ) from 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps in average and ID@@ 3@@ V@@ 1 keyword ( tags ) . &quot;
&quot; both programs should be found as pre @-@ compiled packages for your Linux distribution . a suitable package for l@@ ame can , for example , be found with a search engine since it is considered as not completely free software . anyway , it is not necessary to compile the source files , which you can of course always do . &quot;
please make sure that the directory / usr / share / cd exists and that you have write privileges on it ( eg ; by trying to copy something inside with the kon@@ quer@@ or ) .
the first section covers the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; something which is probably only done once and
the second section describes the procedure for reading a &amp; CD ; what needs to be repeated for each reading &amp; CD ;
&quot; here we determine the enco@@ der to be used for compression of music ( l@@ ame ) as well as the audio format ( MP3 ) as well as the resulting sound quality ( --@@ pres@@ et extreme = &gt; V@@ BR 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ bps ) . as we are lazy , we share the program to download the fre@@ ed@@ b to download the files from the internet . &quot;
&quot; although we can change these settings at any time , we will probably not change them at any time of reading a &amp; CD ; if once the appropriate settings are found . &quot;
the device name is passed to the reading program so that it can read the &amp; CD ; -@@ data / pieces .
&quot; often / dev / c@@ drom is a symbolic link to the actual device name of your drive . if this does not work or if more than one &amp; CD ; / DVD drive is available , a look into the file / etc / f@@ stab and an attempt with the existing entries of the device names for the &amp; CD @-@ ROM ; and / or DVD drives . &quot;
&quot; the card menu General Settings . here &apos;s not much to do here . here an additional conversion can be defined . in our example , everything will be left / entered as shown in the screen@@ shot . &quot;
select only for incomplete information so that you will be informed when details are missing to create keywords ( tags ) .
the card card CD ; settings . simply select both entries . we are comfortable and let the &amp; CD ; data automatically download via the Internet from a fre@@ ed@@ b calcul@@ ator .
note : the computer must be connected to the server during reading the &amp; CD ; it must be connected to the fre@@ ed@@ b server .
&quot; the second selection field is simpler , a &amp; CD ; entry found , starts immediately reading the &amp; CD ; . this is associated with low risk , if you are later dis@@ satisfied with the database entry and the directory names / fil@@ en@@ ames or tag entries , they can easily be changed . the directory name / file name is changed with Kon@@ quer@@ or@@ - &gt; ren@@ ame and the ID@@ 3 tags with K@@ id@@ 3 , the &amp; k@@ de ; Tag@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; you can work with fre@@ ed@@ b locally in offline mode if you want to download the database beforehand . however , if you want to use fre@@ ed@@ b in offline mode , the two sel@@ ections must be selected , at least the first . the mode is set up on the following card card . &quot;
C@@ DD@@ B is for us fre@@ ed@@ b . these are settings for the data request for retri@@ eving the &amp; CD ; information from the fre@@ ed@@ b server over the internet . how does the system know which data the CD should get ? read the section about fre@@ ed@@ b . place everything as shown in the screen@@ shot .
&quot; mode : we did not download the database , we only want to work with the remote database on the Internet server . &quot;
&quot; C@@ DD@@ B @-@ Server : please go to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and look for a mirror server near you . on this way , the load is distributed between the hosts . however , this setting will work as the first attempt . &quot;
&quot; both work equally as far as the server is concerned , as many fire@@ walls bo@@ xed the protocol 88@@ 80 by default , there might be more luck with the protocol 80 , as the protocol is usually open to surf on the Internet . &quot;
in this example we don &apos;t want a &amp; CD ; transmit data to the fre@@ ed@@ b server . de@@ activating the first check box should suff@@ ice .
simply take the settings from the screen@@ shot . ( make sure the folder / tmp is on your computer )
&quot; number of pieces at the same time : sorry , there is a reason why more than one at the same time with only one existing drive ? parallel reading and coding ? the author doesn &apos;t know it , so simply try yourself . &quot;
CD ; after reading the last piece : check this to the &amp; CD ; at the end of the process .
&quot; custom folder for temporary files : if you tick this , then / must specify the path / folder where the WAV files are stored . this can be useful if there is only space on another drive . if the field is not checked , the files will be created in the private folder . &quot;
&quot; enter everything as it is on the screen@@ shot . the command is a bit long , under certain circumstances something must be brow@@ sed to the right to see everything . &quot;
&quot; --@@ pres@@ et extreme &apos; defines the audio quality of the MP@@ 3@@ s . as mentioned earlier , this is a setting for very good audio quality , even for very good hi @-@ fi stereo systems . the resulting bit rate is average around 2@@ 24 to 256 k@@ p@@ bs . the achieved compression ratio is 6.3 . this is a good balance between audio quality and memory consumption . &quot;
note the entry &apos; --@@ id@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 @-@ only &apos; for limiting the generation of tags to V@@ 1 / V@@ 1.@@ 1. &apos; ID@@ 3@@ v2 &apos; tags can also be deleted if required . K@@ id@@ 3 is an excellent &apos; id@@ 3 &apos; tag for &amp; k@@ de ; in case of a later change of tags . % f and % o are internal variables for the name of the input file ( including the complete path ) and the output file ( including the complete path ) .
set the rest as shown in the screen@@ shot . some comments for future use outside of this example :
&quot; number of simultaneously enco@@ ded wa@@ v files : with a dual @-@ core or quad@@ core or even a multi@@ processor machine , it can be attempted to en@@ code more than one WAV file at the same time . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s it , we just finished the basic setup of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; this configuration is used as standard for every reading of a &amp; CD ; if you have clever@@ ly chosen the organizational structure of your music , you never need to change it again . &quot;
&quot; this section describes how the process of reading the &amp; CD ; runs on the hard disk . we will create MP3 files . the folder structure , the way the music is organized on the hard disk , was described in the previous section and set up . the process that is described in this section must be repeated for each read &amp; CD ; the process that is described in this section must be repeated . &quot;
&quot; as we use a &amp; CD ; use that is not yet in fre@@ ed@@ b , the screen@@ shots look slightly different from that for one &amp; CD ; with success of fre@@ ed@@ b logged data . therefore , you will learn the &amp; CD ; data manually instead of retri@@ eving them from the internet . comments will point to the differences . &quot;
don &apos;t try the &amp; CD ; to find this example . it &apos;s a &apos; special &apos; issue of the author of this manual .
&quot; if this has not yet been done , then the &amp; CD must be inserted into the drive that was defined in the main window . &quot;
&quot; after a short moment , the pieces and their length should be listed in the window , just like in the screen@@ shot . this only if the &amp; CD ; can be identified as an audio CD ; can be read and read by c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; if this does not happen , go to the Ques@@ tions and Ans@@ wers section for help or go back to the previous section about the basic settings . &quot;
&quot; attention : if the CD ; successful by the fre@@ ed@@ b , all titles of the pieces are already completed and the name of the artist and the album will be shown . &quot;
&quot; in the event that there is more than one entry in the database with the &apos; unique &apos; &amp; CD ; key for your &amp; CD ; there will be a pop @-@ up window , and you can select the database entry that suits your opinion best on your &amp; CD . &quot;
&quot; if you have not selected the check box for automatic query by fre@@ ed@@ b ( on the page &amp; CD ; settings in the dialog for the settings ) , you can also manually trigger this by selecting the first button in the tool@@ bar . if you do not have a local database , but get the data from the Internet , you need the connection to the Internet . &quot;
e 1.2 step 02 : the CD @-@ Editor - entering the CD @-@ data and the title of the first piece
&quot; enter the data for your &amp; CD ; according to the pattern on the next screen@@ shot . the title of the piece in the first line of the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , the rest of the data in the input field &apos; Album &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the artist no longer needs to be entered in the input field &apos; Current title &apos; , unless you have a compilation of different artists for each piece . &quot;
&quot; the lower comment field can be used for individual comments , the comment field of the album is used for comments that are common to all pieces of the CD . &quot;
&quot; attention : after the successful withdrawal of the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b the CD editor is not empty , but it already contains the data as shown in the following screen@@ shot . however , it is always a good idea to check the content of the CD editor so that you are not only satisfied with the artist &apos;s and album name ( e.g. if all words are starting with capital letters or not ... ) , but also to check if there are any unwanted comments . &quot;
&quot; note : in this example , we only use ID@@ 3@@ v@@ 1 tags . this limits the length of the fields to 30 characters for the artist , album and title of a piece , and on just 28 characters for the comment range . if you use ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags , you will have unlimited field length , at least to what is &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; at most , take a look at the section &apos; Basic settings &apos; . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tag information of the generated files at any time using tag editor . K@@ id@@ 3 is a good tool for MP3 files , with it you can also recre@@ ate ID@@ 3@@ v2 tags . &quot;
tags are not supported by all coding or file formats . see Help for the enco@@ der to get more information .
&quot; in this example , this is not important as we do not transmit the &amp; CD ; for more information go to fre@@ ed@@ b.@@ org and read the information about the categories . pop or Ra@@ p for example are to be found under Rock . &quot;
&quot; after choosing &apos; OK &apos; , you come back to the main window . just click on the line with the second piece . &quot;
&quot; the window of the CD editor appears again and you will see that the fields for the album are already filled with the entered data , which we have recorded for the first piece . simply enter the entries for the fields of the current piece . &quot;
click on the next line in the main window and proceed in the same way until you have entered all title data of the &amp; CD .
note : this window does not appear if you have downloaded the data from the fre@@ ed@@ b . it is already sorted into one of these categories of the database .
it is the third button of the tool@@ bar . note that the artist and the album will be displayed above the piece list .
note that it has a check mark in front of each line of a piece . only the titles that are selected are read out . a simple click on the line switches the selection of the piece or out . make sure that all the pieces are selected or press the All items at the bottom of the screen to select all the pieces at one time .
&quot; if you click on the button selection to start reading the reading process , this window will appear to confirm . click OK and then we will take a look at the window with the orders and track what is going on . &quot;
&quot; in the left upper half of the window , click on the left upper half of the window , directly under the buttons of the tool@@ bar . &quot;
this is the window to check the orders . the first piece is being read on the hard drive . the status of the program is displayed in the left bottom of the window in the status bar .
this error message will see if you try to work with a code that you haven &apos;t yet installed . pieces that have not been successfully enco@@ ded are marked with a red &apos; X &apos; in the order list .
&quot; by the way , the folder for the T@@ MP file and the destination folder are not what we have entered here in the example . have you checked whether you have write access to the folders for temporary files and the destination folder ? ; - ) &quot;
now it is clear why the error occurred right after the end of reading the first piece .
&quot; assignment 1 reads the first piece , it is finished . but we have a new entry : assignment 4 is the encoding of piece 1 to MP3 format . thus , reading and coding parallel . note the status message in the lower part of the window , it is now improved . &quot;
the author of the program has found no configuration setting to supp@@ ress this behavior . the only thing that seems configur@@ able is the number of parallel processes to read and code . the used machine with an AM@@ D@@ 64 does not seem to have a problem with simultaneous reading and coding ( of however two different pieces ) .
&quot; now the last title is read out , while another piece is enco@@ ded and a third order is in the queue of the encoding . after the last piece is enco@@ ded , a small window will be displayed with a message for a short time in the upper left part of the window . &quot;
&quot; for the successful use of &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; , you need &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x@@ . and 4.@@ x and c@@ d@@ par@@ ano@@ ia . if you want to create compressed audio files like MP3 or O@@ GG , you need the enco@@ der of your choice . &quot;
&quot; if you are familiar with CVS , you can download an anonymous copy from there . however , most distri@@ butions already include a pre @-@ compiled package , da &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; a part of an important &amp; k@@ de ; package . if you read this , you have probably already done ... &quot;
&quot; this section is directed to persons compiled from source files , and not for users who use a pre @-@ compiled package of their distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you are looking for help like the program can be adapted to your needs once it is running , then the following is correct for you : &quot;
&quot; a program that calls many different programs , has many variants of settings . it is best to read the step by step , for example , to get to know the options and settings . it shows screen@@ shots of the different card cards of the settings and also contains comments for options that are not used in the example . &quot;
&quot; Hello , still reading this ? even if only the Help menu was cli@@ cked after the first start of the program , without any clu@@ e as to proceed from this somehow empty screen ( especially if there is no audio CD in the drive at the time of program starts ) , or from the un@@ usually short menu ? &quot;
&quot; what is it about ? who reads this , probably already started the program . it should look somehow like this : &quot;
&quot; a bad example : unfortunately , no e @-@ mail . the author cannot maintain this manual . it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; it is intended as the first version for a manual to &amp; k@@ audi@@ o@@ creator ; and if you read this , he has left this section and is therefore agreed with this proposal . &quot;
&quot; stran@@ gely , if you have managed to get the source file from the &amp; k@@ de ; SV@@ N , then you don &apos;t need those information , but ... &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; is the MID@@ I@@ - and kar@@ aoke player from &amp; k@@ de ; besides others , he also has some features with real @-@ time graphics and kar@@ aoke @-@ real @-@ time high@@ lighting also some features that other &amp; UNIX ; -@@ MIDI players do not have . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; runs under &amp; Linux ; and FreeBSD . it builds on the O@@ SS system , should work on all systems with O@@ SS and &amp; k@@ de ; support also supports the &amp; Linux ; Ultr@@ as@@ ound project driver that is needed for CI@@ S cards . Al@@ sa is included as soon as it supports a sequ@@ encer . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; displays the lyrics on the screen with varying color , making it easy to follow the piece . &quot;
graphical representation of the activity of each MIDI channel by high@@ lighting the pressed keys on the ( virtual ) keyboard .
drag and drop so that you can drag in &amp; drop ; any MIDI file from one &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to k@@ mid .
supports both existing standards to save text in MIDI files ( song events or text events ) . k@@ mid automatically determines the method used .
&quot; session support . when you finish a song while playing a song , k@@ mid will start again next time with the same song . &quot;
&quot; supports external MIDI synthes@@ iz@@ ers , AW@@ E , FM and G@@ US cards ( for the latter you need the LU@@ P driver and g@@ us@@ d ) . &quot;
&quot; first , you can select ... from the File menu . it appears the usual file dialog with which you can select the desired song . &quot;
you can also drop a file from a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ Window to the &amp; k@@ mid window . this also works with multiple songs at the same time .
&quot; to play a piece of music , open it and press the button Ab@@ play in the tool@@ bar , select the Ab@@ play from the menu item or press the space bar . &quot;
please note that &amp; k@@ mid ; a piece starts automatically as soon as you draw it to the &amp; k@@ mid ; ( for several pieces they are added to a collection and then played one after the other . )
&quot; once &amp; k@@ mid , play a piece , you can jump to any place by using the middle mouse button and drive with the regulator back and forth . &quot;
&quot; if you find that a song is played too fast or too slowly , you can click on the arrows to the left and right of the tempo display and thus change the playback speed . to get back the original speed , double click on the tem@@ po@@ - LCD . &quot;
&quot; the space bar has two functions : if a piece is played , a pressure on the space bar looks like a pressure on the button Pause or selecting the menu entry pause in the menu item , so interrup@@ ts playback . press the space bar while no piece is played , starts &amp; k@@ mid ; playback . &quot;
&quot; lyrics can be stored in two ways in a piece of music . some pieces use text event , others use lyrics event and some other both . some pieces do not have any text : - ) &quot;
&quot; in &amp; k@@ mid , you can specify which events are to be displayed and even better : the type of event is automatically determined that a song is used , so that you do not have to manually adjust the Kar@@ aoke text . however , you still have the possibility to change this if you want to see the other way . &quot;
&quot; if you want to specify an event type , select text files or song events from the Settings menu . the same function also has the keys 1 and 2 . &quot;
&quot; a collection is a list of MIDI files , which you can summ@@ ari@@ ze . these are played in sequence . in this section you will see how to use collections efficiently . &quot;
&quot; to create a collection , first open the collection manager . you will find this in the menu collection under the Point Organ@@ ize .... Click here to New and enter the name for the collection . &quot;
you can also copy an existing collection by clicking on copying and then speci@@ fying the name for the new collection . this collection will contain the same songs at the beginning as the original .
&quot; if you have more than one collection , you can set the one you want in the collection manager . &quot;
in the temporary collection all songs that you don &apos;t want to add to any other collection .
&quot; when leaving the application , this collection is not saved . remember that when you add many pieces . &quot;
&quot; to add songs to a collection , it has to be selected in the collection manager . there , you can add a song with the Add button . again , the file dialog appears , with which help you can select the desired song . &quot;
a second method to add a song depends on the automatic addition to the collection .
&quot; when automatic addition to the collection is enabled , a piece is automatically added to the active collection when opening ( using File Open or Dra@@ g &amp; Drop ) . &quot;
&quot; when Automati@@ cally add to the collection is not activated , the temporary collection is activated and emp@@ tied when opening a piece . this collection will then be added to the remaining pieces . &quot;
&quot; to remove a song from a collection , you must open the collection manager , select the collection and the desired song and then click on Rem@@ ove . &quot;
&quot; you can select the order in which the songs will be played . if you select the series from the sub@@ menu of the menu collections , the songs will be played in the order as they were added to the collection . &quot;
&quot; when you add or remove songs or select random order in the menu , the order is re@@ defined . &quot;
&quot; to play a song , select it in the collection manager , or use the drop @-@ down list above the kar@@ aoke text . &quot;
&quot; to skip a song , select the Next song button , the entry next song from the menu item or press the button arrow to the right . &quot;
&quot; to conver@@ sely jump a song back , select the Pre@@ vious piece button , the entry Pre@@ view piece from the menu item or press the button arrow to the left . &quot;
&quot; to delete a collection , open the collection manager , select the collection to be deleted and click the Del@@ ete button . &quot;
&quot; the temporary collection cannot be deleted , but this does not matter , since it is not stored when leaving . &quot;
&quot; this is absolutely necessary for synthes@@ iz@@ ers , which are not general MIDI capable . in this case , the MIDI @-@ Map transl@@ ates general MIDI events into events that the synthes@@ izer understands . &quot;
&quot; for example , you can create a MIDI map that converts all events of the Change patch to B@@ right Piano type in events of the Change patch to Tru@@ mp@@ et type and thus always sound a trumpet when playing a piano . &quot;
&quot; if you have only one sound card , you don &apos;t need MIDI @-@ map because all sound cards GM -@@ compatible ( including A@@ we - and G@@ US cards , FM devices and so on ) . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there are no programs to create MIDI maps . so you have to edit the corresponding file by hand ( with your favorite editor ) . &quot;
a MIDI map is a text file that stores all required re@@ plac@@ ements for playing a piece .
&quot; each section may only appear once , except the key@@ map section , which may appear as often as desired . however , this requires that each occurrence has a different text ID ( see below ) . &quot;
Def@@ ine P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP ... EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; Name of the key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine key@@ map &quot; A further key@@ map ... &quot; EN@@ D Def@@ ine CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP ... EN@@ D OP@@ TION@@ S ... EN@@ D
see that Def@@ ine is used to indicate that a section starts ( except for OP@@ TION@@ S ) and EN@@ D that the end of a section is reached .
please send me your map file as email so that I can offer in future versions of &amp; k@@ mid ; support can provide for devices that are not General MIDI compliant .
this section shows how the patches of General MIDI are m@@ apped to your specific keyboard . general use looks like this :
&quot; please note that the left side of the equal sign is ignored . it is assumed that the GM patches are in the correct order ( from 0 to 127 ) , so you may not change the order and leave no line for one of 128 instruments . &quot;
&quot; for example , if your keyboard does not support a gun ( GM @-@ Patch 127 ) , you can use a drum ( e.g. with tone 60 ) , which is similar to a gun . to do this , use the following in the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section : &quot;
&quot; so if you want to play a MIDI file with Patch 127 ( rif@@ le shot ) , it takes patch 100 ( the drum on your keyboard ) and plays the sound 60 , regardless of which sound is in the MIDI file . &quot;
&quot; please note that here the term drum patch is meant to represent another perc@@ us@@ sion@@ ist instrument ( drum , cy@@ mb@@ al , mar@@ ac@@ as &amp; etc ; ) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum ( as some key@@ boards have ) . &quot;
the key@@ map section is used to indicate how sounds are m@@ apped on a particular channel or instrument . the use is :
&quot; as with the P@@ AT@@ CH@@ MAP section , the sequence of rows is very important , as is the presence . so you have to create 128 entries . &quot;
you can define several key@@ maps for each channel and instrument . you only have to use different names in the first row .
key@@ maps are used mainly to map sounds to the perc@@ ussions channel . take a look at the included key@@ maps .
&quot; this section can be used to map some channels to others . for example , if you want to exchange the first and second channel , just make it in the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section . &quot;
&quot; however , these settings are useful for key@@ boards which have the percussion on a particular channel ( General MIDI on Channel 10 , others need the channels 16 or 9 ) . &quot;
&quot; MIDI devices need 16 channels , the CH@@ AN@@ N@@ EL@@ MAP section has 16 lines , numbered from 0 to 15 , based on the following pattern : &quot;
&quot; if you use the key@@ map option , the key@@ map will need to be defined further forward in the file . if you use the For@@ ce@@ Patch option , all events will be ignored to change the patch on that channel . in this case , patch x will always be used . &quot;
&quot; the For@@ ce@@ Patch option can , for example , be useful to always use the perc@@ ussions @-@ patch on the percussion channel . &quot;
&quot; the value for Pit@@ ch@@ Ben@@ der@@ R@@ atio indicates in which ratio pitch @-@ Ben@@ der events are multiplied . so , if a MIDI file sends a pitch @-@ Ben@@ der event with the value n , it is converted with the formula n * ( r / 40@@ 96 ) and then re@@ directed . the value 40@@ 96 is used so that in the map file there are no dec@@ im@@ al commands . &quot;
&quot; this setting is needed because GM speci@@ fies that a keyboard that gets a pitch @-@ ben@@ der event with the value 40@@ 96 to play a sound higher . unfortunately , some key@@ boards are trying to play two notes up to one oc@@ tave higher . to find the right value on your keyboard , you need to try a bit with &amp; k@@ mid . &quot;
&quot; to use a MIDI map , simply open the MIDI settings dialog . &quot;
the channel view is a window with a whole series of pi@@ anos ( one for each MIDI channel ) . on these key@@ boards you see what sounds are being played .
&quot; you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel . for each channel there is a drop @-@ down list where you can select an instrument . if you have changed an instrument , the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used . &quot;
&quot; the channel view has ( until now ) two different views to display the played sounds . in the View menu , select the Settings menu under the channel view : &quot;
&quot; the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played . the higher the number , the greater the speed . &quot;
&quot; you can change the tempo of a song . for example , if you find a song too fast to follow the text , you can slow down it . to change the tempo , use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD . &quot;
&quot; a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music . it contains the notes , rhythm , speed , &amp; etc ; . thus , the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices at very different results , just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways . &quot;
&quot; but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB , while an mp3 file needs 4 MB ( a compression ratio of 1 : 80 ) and with a good synthes@@ izer you get a similar sound quality . &quot;
&quot; this can happen if you have a binary distribution ( rpm , de@@ b ) by &amp; k@@ mid ; this happens because &amp; k@@ mid ; without AW@@ E support was compiled . to eliminate the problem , you need to download and install a source distribution ( e.g. from k@@ mid ; &apos;s start page ) &quot;
&quot; I want to add a whole folder to a collection , but I don &apos;t want to add all the files separately . &quot;
&quot; you agree , therefore supports &amp; k@@ mid ; drag and drop . just open the folder that you want to add in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , select all files , and drag them to the &amp; k@@ mid ; window . &quot;
&quot; first of all , enable automatic adding to the collection . otherwise , the files will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; you can press the arrow button on the left of the Tem@@ po@@ - LCD to slow playback . to restore the default tempo , you can double click on the LCD . &quot;
I have on a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Desktop a &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ window with my MIDI Fol@@ der and &amp; k@@ mid ; on this desktop ( if I play a kar@@ aoke file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) or attached ( if I want to play a kar@@ aoke file ) .
&quot; if you just want to listen to a file quickly , without adding it to a collection , turn the automatic addition to the collection , and the new one ; file will be added to the temporary collection . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s assume you have the MIDI files A.@@ mid , B.@@ mid and C.@@ mid@@ . first , you just want to play the first file . so set the automatic addition to the collection and open A.@@ amid . your temporary collection then contains exactly this one MIDI file . &quot;
then you decide to play B.@@ S@@ mid and C.@@ mid and create a collection with all three files . how do you do that ?
&quot; these people sent me MIDI files or postcards . thank you so much ! if I hear these songs or see the postcard , it encourages me to continue programming . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mid ; was written by &amp; Antoni@@ o.@@ Lar@@ ro@@ sa@@ .@@ Jim@@ en@@ ez ; from Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga ( Spain ) . I study mathematics at the University of Ma@@ acute ; Mal@@ aga . at the moment I &apos;m in the third year , so I do not have much free time for my hob@@ bies , but I try to take a bit of time for my hob@@ bies . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know where to download MIDI / Kar@@ aoke files , if you have a question , an error or an idea for an extension of &amp; k@@ mid ; or even if you just want to make me happy , write me an e @-@ mail : lar@@ rosa @ k@@ de@@ .org or ant@@ lar@@ r @ ar@@ rak@@ is@@ .@@ es &quot;
&quot; if you send me a postcard or a MIDI file , I will be among friends of &amp; k@@ mid ; if you want to send a MIDI file , you should contact me as I may already have the file . &quot;
I have written &amp; k@@ mid ; written entirely in my spare time and won &apos;t get money from anyone . I therefore want to emphasize that I only want to program because / when I get feedback from users ( postcards or emails ) .

a sound card . I recommend a good sound card or an external synthes@@ izer because the sound quality depends essentially on your sound card . it &apos;s not the same whether you use a FM device or an AW@@ E card .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have a sound card , you must compile and comp@@ ress with the parameter MO@@ DE _ DE@@ MO _ ON@@ LY@@ VIS@@ U@@ AL . it then runs as if you had a sound card , except that you can of course hear no music . &quot;

&quot; S@@ MB ; is a simple user interface for M@@ Player , Phon@@ o and FF@@ MPEG . the program is used to play video files supported by M@@ Player or Phon@@ on , as well as to playback DVD &apos;s , V@@ CD s or TV and camera . &quot;

&quot; the application window is made of so @-@ called and@@ o@@ ck@@ able windows . there is always the window with the central view . optionally , there is the window with the playlist . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to save the preferred links under the book@@ marks menu , but these are individual entries . if you want to create a list of entries that are played after each other , you should use the category Defini@@ tive Play@@ list . &quot;
&quot; of course you can add groups to groups to get an additional hierarchy . if you have an entry , his group and all its sub@@ groups are copied to the current category and the playback begins with the cli@@ cked entry . &quot;
&quot; the various files in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ Player / directory can be changed by an editor , but also by the application itself . &quot;
&quot; after changing XML files , you have to select the matching playlist from the menu and select either the editing mode , or select another category . &quot;
all changes will be lost when the editing mode is left or another group is selected without the same playlist .
&quot; as a result of the convenience of the author of &amp; KM@@ Player , some functions can only be switched on by changing the XML configuration files . &quot;
&quot; the animation during start and end can be de@@ activated by editing ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c and modify &#91; General Options &#93; No In@@ tro = 0 ob@@ oth option to &apos; 1 &apos; . if the option is not present , it can be easily inserted . &quot;
it is also possible to enable another animation . &amp; KM@@ Player ; will follow the files ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / KM@@ player / intro@@ .x@@ ml and ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / DATA@@ form@@ .x@@ ml . the format must be a supported XML file .
&quot; the animation during startup doesn &apos;t need to be short , it is automatically terminated by opening another source . this would be annoying at the end animation , so the user can end the application a second time . &quot;
a simple example of a start @-@ animation can be the display of a favorite photo : &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; In the source package of &amp; KM@@ Player ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / sm@@ il@@ gt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; / lt ; &amp; lt ; /
there is a tab for configuration of M@@ Player in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; . here the path from the M@@ Player and the cache size of the data stream can be set out of the network and other things .
another tool for troubleshooting is the button &apos; Con@@ sole &apos; in the tool@@ bar of KM@@ Z . here is the output of mp@@ layer visible .
there is no tab for this ren@@ dition in the configuration dialog of &amp; KM@@ Player ; . everything must be configured by manually editing the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c just like setting the back@@ end by mim@@ et@@ ype . here is an example like a flash with the module sw@@ f@@ dec @-@ mo@@ z@@ illa :
&apos;@@ Flash &apos; can be played within &amp; KM@@ player ; it can even be inserted the special field em@@ bed for YouTube in the playlist XML .
&quot; in order for the &amp; KM@@ player to play &apos; flash &apos; in HTML pages , the &amp; KM@@ Player must be specified as service provider for the Mim@@ e type application / x @-@ sho@@ ck@@ wave flash in the setup dialog file attri@@ bution of K@@ DE . &quot;
&quot; the Kon@@ quer@@ or or S@@ MB ; can be started in a console application and search for error messages regarding the loading of the browser module library . if there are no errors , the Back@@ end Edition is within &amp; KM@@ Player ; ( view , console , or console from the context menu ) . &quot;
&quot; so that always a pre@@ defined back@@ end is taken for a specific mim@@ e type ( of course only if this is determined ) , this must be done by manual modification of the file ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / config / k@@ mp@@ lay@@ er@@ c . for example , phon@@ on should play all o@@ gg files : &quot;
&quot; S@@ MB ; can be played by TV cards , either using M@@ Player or X@@ Video ( this needs k@@ x@@ v@@ player ) . before watching TV , you need to configure the device and the TV channels . to do this , the scanner can be used from the configuration dialog or the configuration file can be edited manually . &quot;
&quot; to configure V@@ DR ( Video Files Rec@@ order ) settings in the KM@@ player , the dialog in the Settings under - &gt; Qu@@ el@@ t- &gt; VD@@ R@@ - &gt; X@@ Video Port should be detected . the encoding must be detected ( e.g. it is PAL for West Europe ) , the correct name probably has a dv@@ b in it . &quot;
&quot; since the V@@ DR support of KM@@ player can only use X@@ Video , X@@ Video should also work ( probably this kind of playing video devices under Linux is the only one that works ) . for this reason , the video@@ for@@ lin@@ ux extension must be functional for the X server . for the X@@ Free@@ 86 server , the following must be included in its configuration file ( / etc / X@@ 11 / X@@ F@@ 86@@ Con@@ fig ) . &quot;
&quot; internally , various names are used by S@@ MEs . at the time of creating this documentation , these are dv@@ d@@ nav@@ source , dv@@ d@@ source , ex@@ it@@ source , intro@@ source , pi@@ pes@@ ource , t@@ v@@ scanner , TV@@ Source , ur@@ l@@ source , v@@ c@@ d@@ source and v@@ dr@@ source . &quot;
are there hints about how to qui@@ eter my CD@@ ROM drive if I play from him ( not from the V@@ CD : / / ) ?
&quot; yes , the h@@ d@@ par@@ m -@@ E 8 / dev / c@@ drom command can be run as user root after connecting the device . it is absolutely safe to make sure that / dev / c@@ drom drives on the CD@@ ROM drive . &quot;
&quot; x@@ ine only starts slowly , why does my CPU need to be checked for its performance ? &quot;

Q@@ t ; : &amp; Q@@ t ; is a C + + library for creating graphical user interfaces and network support and is needed for comp@@ iling &amp; ki@@ cking ;
lat@@ ex ; : a professional writing application . under Unix @-@ like systems it is likely to refer to the package &amp; ly@@ live ; or &amp; tet@@ ex ; ( for older systems ) .
most of these components can be included in the used &amp; Linux distribution . for installation the documentation of the distribution or installation CD ; / DVD should be used .
the &amp; Ki@@ le ; Project contains some pre @-@ compiled packages from &amp; Ki@@ le ; for different distri@@ butions . these allow easy installation without further comp@@ iling and are included on the box ; website .
&quot; this manual is accessible to everyone regardless of the experiences with &amp; lat@@ ex ; , &amp; k@@ de ; , &amp; Ki@@ le ; or &amp; Linux ; . &quot;
&quot; advanced users should hardly read this manual . however , all suggestions for documentation are taken into account . if the support for this project or its documentation is desired , the contact via the box should be made . &quot;
&quot; if you have questions or if you would like to compile a file , please refer to the Ki@@ le @-@ de@@ vel @ list@@ s.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net mailing list . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is an integrated &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ environment for the &amp; k@@ de ; desktop . &amp; Ki@@ le ; offers the possibility to use all &amp; lat@@ ex ; functions in a graphical interface and within this a simple , immediate and tailor @-@ made access to all &amp; lat@@ ex ; programs . &quot;
&quot; to learn more about posters ; and to learn more about his possibilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted with Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working with the editor of &amp; kate just before reading the chapter . &quot;

&quot; in order to be able to master , good books should be used for example H. Kop@@ ka / P. W. D@@ aly , A Guide to &amp; lat@@ ex ; : document Pre@@ par@@ ation for Beg@@ inners and Advanced U@@ sers , 3rd Edition , 1999 . &quot;
&quot; the introduction contains at least the command \ \ document@@ class , the body begins with the command \ \ begin { document } and must be closed again with the command \ \ end { document } . &quot;
the Quick Start Wiz@@ ard by &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a useful function for fast creation of a document in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the selection of the wizard ( menu ) offers some possibilities for creating the document .
&quot; document classes : this introduces the type of document to be created : articles ( article ) , book &#91; book &#93; , report &#91; PDF &#93; , report &#91; sc@@ r@@ art@@ cl &#93; , report ( DIN ) &#91; sc@@ r@@ &#91; &#93; , proj@@ ectors &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; , films &#91; Pro@@ sp@@ er &#93; or user @-@ defined . &quot;
&quot; encoding : hereby the character encoding is set . modern systems are increasingly using UT@@ F @-@ 8 encoding as standard . at best , UT@@ F @-@ 8@@ X should be used ( for correct processing of &amp; lat@@ ex ; documents ) . &quot;
&quot; this list contains the most frequently used auxiliary packages for lat@@ ex ; for integration , they only need to be balanced in the check box . &quot;
&quot; article ( DIN ) , Book ( DIN ) , Report ( DIN ) , Brief ( DIN ) : the documentation classes of Kom@@ a @-@ Script ( to comply with German DIN regulations ) . &quot;
new users don &apos;t have to worry about this . it is merely a brief description of the functions and more detailed information is given in the section .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides - just like other source editors - high@@ lighting the used commands , settings and elements ( as well as the in@@ appropriate ) . &quot;
&quot; automatic completion of the settings will be created when entering a new command ( e.g. \ \ begin { command } ) by &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically creates a blank line ( for example , \ \ end { command } ) and the corresponding line for sending the command ( e.g. \ \ end { command } ) . this function can be set up in the Edit menu ... La@@ Te@@ X commands are disabled . &quot;
all documents are usually sub@@ divided into some elements . &amp; lat@@ ex ; allows the sub@@ division of the document into the following elements ( part is the highest and sub@@ paragraph the bottom element ) :
&quot; in the view of the document in the structure view , the individual elements can be changed and viewed by clicking on the respective object . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own &amp; lat@@ ex ; files , the recovery search can be very helpful . as soon as a DVI file ( eng . D e V ice I n@@ v file ) &#93; was created , jumps &amp; Ki@@ le ; by clicking with the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ viewer to the corresponding line in the &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ source . &quot;
&quot; a DVI file contains a description of the format@@ ted document and also other information such as the font and is next to PDF the output type of &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; . there are many tools for viewing , converting and printing DVI ; -@@ files for different systems and devices . &quot;
&quot; when using the R@@ Ã ¼ ck search , the elements of the DVI file are linked to the editor and as soon as an element is cli@@ cked on the DVI file , the corresponding tag in the &amp; lat@@ ex file is the exact opposite of it . as soon as a section in the &amp; lat@@ ex file is cli@@ cked , the corresponding passage is in the DVI ; viewer spec@@ ulated . &quot;
&quot; master document : this function is used in working with multiple files . with a master document , working with other .@@ tex files is simplified . when using a project , a project @-@ wide master document can be set to project settings . &quot;
fast construction : the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code is compiled and the result is automatically displayed ( unless there is no error in the source code ) .
&quot; file Monitoring : in this mode , the DVI file is &apos; over@@ grown &apos; , and there is no call from and ey@@ epi@@ ece ; after the quick construction . &quot;
&quot; when viewing the tool@@ bar , the three large selection boxes should be found . the selection boxes have been developed for quick introduction of common elements into the document . the first selection field is for quick integration of the document into parts , chapters , sections , ... The ad@@ missible &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ instructions for sub@@ division are : &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Other &quot; &quot; sel@@ ector is for inser@@ ting articles such as tags , links or references . the options available are : &quot;
&quot; name : this command creates a name for a section , a picture or another element . &quot;
reference : used for reference to a specified term ( selection of a selection field possible ) .
&quot; when using quotes , a selection list with literary entries appears . at &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; this only works if the file belongs to a project . the author has good experiences with &amp; k@@ bi@@ b@@ tex ; and &amp; k@@ bi@@ b ; . the &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; -@@ files can of course be written in &amp; Ki@@ le ; manually written by hand . &quot;
&quot; the last drop @-@ down box named &quot; &quot; Gr@@ Ã ¶ ca &quot; &quot; is used for the definition of the font . you can specify the font sizes for the main text , the links , etc . &quot;
&quot; when calling &amp; box , two choices are available : 1 . the wizard for creating a new document by selecting the document type and placing the settings . 2 . the document can be written from scratch with the hand . &quot;
&quot; the par@@ enth@@ eses after the command \ \ document@@ class contain the settings for the command . setting &#91; 12@@ pt &#93; speci@@ fies the font . if the font is not set at the beginning , this can also be done in the text . &quot;
&quot; once the source code above has been entered , the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source code must be compiled . the easiest way to do this is to use the building or touch of the button . &quot;
the source code must be stored before comp@@ iling . &amp; Ki@@ le ; automatically exec@@ utes the storage .
&quot; if the comp@@ iling of the document fails , it should be searched for the errors in logging . when using Quick Construction , it should be started automatically . if this is not the case , the logging should also be followed . &quot;
&quot; an environment ( environment ) is a text that is different from the rest of the document . for example , a report with the font size 12 is created and only a few summ@@ its shall have another font . the command \ \ begin { environment } , \ \ Hu@@ ge and \ \ end { environment } will then allow the change of the fonts within the environment &quot; &quot; huge &quot; &quot; ( engl@@ . Hu@@ ge ) . &quot;
the changes are made only within the environment ( from \ \ begin { environment } to \ \ end { environment } ) . there is no restriction ( number ) for the changes within an environment .
&quot; there are many possibilities to increase the read@@ ability and user @-@ friendliness of the document . for example , certain fonts , bold printing , cur@@ sive printing , sub@@ missions , etc. can be added . these commands will either end with the \ \ end or automatically at the end of the environment . &quot;
begin { emp@@ h } : this command is for the itali@@ c expression and is invalid until it is closed with a \ \ end { emp@@ h } or another environment . a single word in a set can be expressed in ital@@ ics with \ \ emp@@ h { word } .
\ \ quot@@ a : creates a quote in the document . the quote starts with \ \ begin { quot@@ a } and ends with \ \ end { quot@@ a } .
&quot; after the background for writing the source text with the &amp; lat@@ ex ; mark@@ up language is displayed , now follows a step @-@ by @-@ step guide for creating a document in &amp; Ki@@ le . &quot;
&quot; once a bit of text was entered in the wizard , some adjustments should be made for the better read@@ ability of the document . to do this , there should be a quotation , a few places in fat and cur@@ sive printing and a poem to be applied to see the differences of these commands . &quot;
&quot; once the document is viewed , editor View or C@@ trl E can be returned to the editor ( with the internal viewer ) . &quot;
&quot; once the DVI file was created , the document can be printed or converted to a &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF file . simply try and have fun . &quot;
&quot; DVI ; is an independent file format ( eng@@ l . D e V ice I n@@ v ) . these files are created by &amp; tex ; or &amp; lat@@ ex ; for read@@ ability from some drivers of the computer . there are many different types of .d@@ vi output such as printers , &amp; Post@@ Script ; / PDF converting or computer screens . &quot;
&quot; for printing a &amp; DVI file , the same steps as for creating the document are necessary ( see ) . at the 7th step - after clicking on DVI , the document can then be printed by file printing ( in the viewer ) ( if the printer is set correctly ) . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bar allows to convert the DVI file into other formats . as soon as the DVI file was created from the &amp; lat@@ ex ; source , the conversion can begin using the buttons in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
the search function allows the direct jump from the editor to the corresponding position within the DVI file .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a suitable setting for all &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ bin@@ aries . to do this , just setup Modern under Settings ... &quot;
&quot; to select the preferred search , the mouse cursor must be positioned in a line of the source text and then cli@@ cked on forward search . the jump to the corresponding place in DVI ; -@@ viewer is then done . &quot;
with this function in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; with a click of the middle mouse button in DVI ; -@@ document the corresponding &amp; lat@@ ex ; -@@ Document from &amp; Ki@@ le ; open and jump to the corresponding line . to do so &amp; Ki@@ le ; in &amp; Ok@@ ular ; set as text editor ( Setup ... Editor )
&quot; should a fault occur when using the fast construction of the &amp; DVI ; if there is an error , this will be summ@@ arized in the log file or in the message window . &quot;
&quot; the log file explains the source code error source . in the editor , the previous La@@ Te@@ X errors and multiple La@@ Te@@ X errors can be used for spr@@ int between errors . in order to view the er@@ ron@@ eous line , the error in logging must be cli@@ cked and &amp; Ki@@ le ; jumps to the er@@ ron@@ eous line . &quot;
&quot; once cli@@ cked on the respective button in the tool@@ bar , a window will appear to select the template to use for the document . the default options are : &quot;
&quot; when selecting empty documents , a document can either be re@@ written from scratch or the wizard for quick creation of a new document can be used . further information is included in the section . &quot;
&quot; reliable users of &amp; lat@@ ex ; mostly use the same introduction for almost all documents . templates can be created , stored and loaded in order to facilitate the creation of a new document . &quot;
&quot; to create a new template , either an existing &amp; tex ; - / lat@@ ex ; file must be opened or created a new file . &amp; Ki@@ le ; can create a new template by using an existing document and selecting File template from document ... &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document from a template using the New file , some strings may be replaced by other data ( e.g. name or character encoding ) . these variables can be set up in the settings box ... settings General set . &quot;
&quot; when creating your own template , it is therefore necessary to know which strings are replaced by which variables : &quot;
$ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ : this string is replaced by entering into document class . typically it is used as follows : \ \ document@@ class &#91; $ $ DO@@ CU@@ MEN@@ T@@ CLA@@ SS@@ OP@@ TION@@ S $ $ &#93; { items } .
&quot; the simplest way to create a template is to use the wizard and the corresponding input of the commands in the editor . once the document has been created in this way , the following steps must be executed : &quot;
&quot; when creating a new document , your own template can then be selected instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; a template can be created from any &amp; lat@@ ex ; files created in an easy way to create a template , should be searched for one on the Internet and will be carried out under described steps . &quot;
&amp; Ki@@ le ; used &amp; Plac@@ ards ; as an internal editor . &amp; kate ; is a text editor for programmers with the ability to read and produce from many different types of text files ( including also &amp; lat@@ ex ; and &amp; bi@@ b@@ tex ; ) .
&quot; to learn more about posters ; and to learn more about his possibilities , the manual should be consul@@ ted with Kate . users of &amp; Ki@@ le ; can start working with the editor of &amp; kate just before reading the chapter . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a very practical &amp; lat@@ ex ; command reference which can be accessed through the La@@ Te@@ X reference menu . it contains a detailed description of almost all commands , which can be found in &amp; lat@@ ex ; use as well as their syntax . &quot;
&quot; double @-@ clicking with the C@@ trl key to select the &amp; tex ; this means that in this way , when you click on \ \ &quot; par \ \ \ big@@ a only \ \ &quot; &quot; is selected . &quot;
&quot; when dra@@ gging the text with pressed left mouse button , the selected text is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . &quot;
&quot; when using the arrow keys with pressed Shift key , parts of the source code can be selected in the editor window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; has the possibility to browse different kinds of source code and highlight these . for example , the &amp; lat@@ ex works ; -@@ commands from the normal text and also the mathematical formul@@ as are highlighted by a different color . &quot;
&quot; many assistants can add additional jump marks within the text . this is an own type of book@@ marks within the text . the menu items do jump marks or the respective keys make the jump to the next or last jump mark . thereby , this jump mark is highlighted so that it is automatically deleted at the first input of a character . &quot;
&quot; editing is probably one of the main aspects when using a program such as &amp; Ki@@ le ; although &amp; makes ; already excellent options , were added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; important functions for writing a &amp; lat@@ ex ; &amp; Ki@@ le ; special commands for their selection . under Edit selection , the following commands are included in the text selection : &quot;
&quot; select a complete paragraph ( group of lines containing a blank line on both sides ) . this extended meaning does not include a text with per@@ tin@@ ent lines ( like in other text editors ) . this extended meaning includes tables , &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands and all other lines of the source code . this means that the paragra@@ phs are separated by two blank lines . &quot;
&quot; this selection also has an extended meaning , since this command also exp@@ ires &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands with a single click ( \ \ ) and an additional star ( * ) at the end . &quot;
&quot; to delete a part of the document , it can be selected first and removed by pressing the Del@@ ete key . &amp; Plac@@ ards ; provides the key C@@ trl ; K with which the entire line is removed . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides with own commands for a faster possibility . &quot;
removes a complete paragraph . the definition for a paragraph in &amp; Ki@@ le ; is contained in the description to edit select paragraph .
&quot; it has already been clari@@ fied that environments play a central role in &amp; lat@@ ex ; therefore , &amp; Ki@@ le ; for more commands under Edit environment for a more convenient simple work with &amp; lat@@ ex ; . &quot;
this command will jump to the start of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly in front of the command to open the environment .
this command will jump to the end of the current environment ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the command to place the environment .
&quot; if the cursor is in front of or inside the command \ \ begin { environment } , jump to the end of the environment ( or vice versa ) . &quot;
&quot; with the input of many ne@@ sted ambient commands , the overview can be quickly lost . this command closes the recently opened environment so that the ne@@ sted environment structure is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; also provides special commands for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; groups , which are determined by par@@ enth@@ eses { ... } . under Edit Te@@ X group are a few important commands that correspond to those from editing environment . &quot;
this command will jump to the start of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) .
this command will jump to the end of the current group ( no matter where the current position is ) . the cursor is placed directly behind the welded clamp .
if the cursor is in front of or behind the welded clamp of a &amp; tex ; -@@ group # is jumped to the other end of the group ( or vice versa ) .
&quot; in the input of many ne@@ sted groups braces , the over@@ look can be quickly lost . this command closes the last opened group , so that the ne@@ sted structure of the tex ; groups is not destroyed . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; lat@@ ex ; two simple reference marks are used as genes . for the purpose @-@ bringing implementation is used in &amp; Ki@@ le ; the sign &quot; &quot; for two simple reference marks is used . &quot;
this automatic entry of the double quotes can be set up under Settings Ki@@ le ... La@@ Te@@ X can be switched on and off .
&quot; ad @-@ specific settings ( e.g. n@@ german or French ) can be used , so that German or French suits are used . there are also many other languages available . &quot;
&quot; if the current position is located within a lists environment ( e.g. en@@ um@@ er@@ ate or it@@ em@@ ize ) , &amp; Ki@@ le ; not just a new@@ line , but at the same time the command \ \ item . &quot;
&quot; within a sp@@ read@@ sheet environment , close &amp; Ki@@ le ; the current line with \ \ \ \ with an end @-@ to @-@ end line break . &quot;
even better - &amp; Ki@@ le ; is intelligent enough to support pres@@ et &amp; lat@@ ex ; - or user @-@ defined environments . these can be added under Settings Ki@@ le ; Set ... La@@ Te@@ X to be added .
&quot; some users want to arrange the columns in tables -@@ environments and thereby all the E@@ t characters ( amp ; ) among each other . by pressing Shift ; Alt ; amp ; search &amp; Ki@@ le ; after the next tab in the above line . even though this tab is not the appropriate , add &amp; Ki@@ le ; some intermediate space for the column position of the current tab . &quot;
&quot; although &amp; posters ; already a good source code completion , this was added in &amp; Ki@@ le ; for special commands ( usually for &amp; lat@@ ex ; ) , three different modes are added . all of these modes can be set up for different modes of operation under Settings ... fully set . &quot;
at the beginning a new environment using the command \ \ begin { environment } will be added &amp; box ; automatically add the command \ \ end { environment } following an empty line ( for the text ) .
&quot; when pressing the back button , the last letter of the input will be removed and it is possible to over@@ size the complete list . on the other hand , the list may also be smaller by entering another letter . &quot;
&quot; all commands are written with a short description of their parameters . alternatively , the descriptions are removed by selecting a command . alternatively , jump marks can be added to these positions , so that a simple jump to these positions is possible by modi@@ fying the selected jump brand and the desired parameters can then be added . &quot;
&quot; among settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; all settings can be made to these lists . there can be different list lists for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands , as well as well @-@ timer for the general language use . &quot;
&quot; command mode is not necessary for complete environments . there are always a few letters with \ \ begin to be entered and the inv@@ oc@@ ation mode will result in a large list of environment commands . on the other hand , the environments are so often used that &amp; Ki@@ le ; a special mode for completing environments . &quot;
&quot; when calling the full stop mode over menu Edit environment or key Alt + Shift key , the command to open the environment is automatically captured and it appears \ \ begin { . thereafter , the environment can be continued in the easiest way and by pressing the input key . &quot;
&quot; once this is done , the environment will automatically close again . once &amp; Ki@@ le ; recognizes that it is a list environment , even a first \ \ item command is added . &quot;
&quot; under Settings box ; set up ... Ki@@ le ; all settings can be made to these lists . this mode uses the list of default , for &amp; tex ; - and &amp; lat@@ ex ; commands . &quot;
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; supports custom lists of abbrevi@@ ations , which can be replaced immediately by longer strings . the lists can be set up under settings box ... The file ex@@ amp@@ le.@@ c@@ w@@ l , in which , for example , the entry L = \ \ La@@ Te@@ X is included . &quot;
&quot; for example , the letter L is entered , and the word completion mode is introduced over the Edit menu or the C@@ trl + Alt @-@ key menu , the character L is replaced by the \ \ La@@ Te@@ X string . &quot;
&quot; large cloth@@ s are not helpful for automatic completion . however , it has been noted that many W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters are written in a document more than once . thus , &amp; Ki@@ le ; the completion for all written W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ters . &quot;
this mode can be set up in the box settings box ... Nob@@ le can be disabled . here also the threshold value for the display of completion can be specified .
&quot; the completion files can be installed in the ~ / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Ki@@ le / complete / mode / the Per@@ s@@ able Home folder . mode stands for abbrevi@@ ation ( abbrevi@@ ation ) , dictionary ( W@@ Ã ¶ r@@ ter@@ buch ) or tex . &quot;
&quot; the dialog graphics create the creation of graphics as simple as possible . to over@@ see the basics of graphic formats , the sections should be considered and considered . &quot;
&quot; PS files are not as well @-@ known as PDF files , but provide an excellent basis for changes and new orders of pages . if the PDF output is required , the pages can be re@@ arranged with a few &amp; Post@@ Script ; tools can then be converted to a PDF file with ps@@ 2@@ pdf . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to examine the result of the work , the source code needs to be compiled . all building tools are grouped in groups in the creation of comp@@ iling , creating and creating views . &quot;
&quot; for comp@@ iling the source code for viewer such as the ey@@ epi@@ ece ; or the further conversion can be used the key Alt ; 2 . after that , the DVI file can be viewed by Alt ; 3 , using Alt ; 4 , the DVI ; file is converted to a PS file and viewed with Alt ; 5 the PS file . &quot;
&quot; when using the Quick Construction command , a viewer is usually called after comp@@ iling . if no built @-@ in viewer is used , a new window will open each time . &quot;
a new project is about the project &apos;s new project .... In the event the following information is requested for the project :
&quot; when the file name window opens , the relative path must be specified by the .@@ kil@@ ep@@ r project file . &quot;
the script function of &amp; Ki@@ le ; allows the execution of the EC@@ MA@@ Script code . the scripts can be managed in the vertical bar .
the API scripts have not yet been developed yet and can be added to other versions of &amp; Ki@@ le .
first it must be said that the execution environment of the scripts in &amp; box ; a system @-@ wide object ( = box ) with the following methods has :
&quot; &amp; lat@@ ex ; is a well @-@ declared system , in which the basic functions can be expanded by a variety of additional packages . &amp; Ki@@ le ; provides a lot of different help to support the users . &quot;
&amp; tet@@ ex ; and &amp; tex@@ live ; are delivered with many documents . it contains a documentation for the included packages and a further &amp; lat@@ ex ; reference .
&quot; this is not just a description of all programs ( but a few important pack@@ ets are described ) but rather is a complete manual for the &amp; lat@@ ex ; it is a very large document , it is divided into three important book@@ marks . &quot;
&quot; because of the quantity of documents with which &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; extra@@ di@@ ted , finding the right document is not always easy . as possible help provides &amp; tet@@ ex ; / tex@@ live ; the small application Tex@@ doc@@ t@@ k , which contains a database with all documents and contains a graphical top surface . &quot;
all documents are divided into categories and the main advantage is the search for package names or keywords . by &amp; Ki@@ le ; only the results are displayed .
double @-@ clicking with the mouse or holding the space bar opens the viewer for the document .
&quot; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is a qu@@ el@@ lo@@ ff@@ ier and user @-@ friendly &amp; lat@@ ex ; - / tex ; source code editor , which can be mach@@ ined on all systems with installed &amp; k@@ de ; &amp; Ki@@ le ; is also a part of the Fink project , which can also be used on &amp; Mac ; with OS X installed . &quot;
&quot; many thanks to those who are striving for the progress of the &amp; Ki@@ le ; project asp@@ iring and sacrific@@ ing for many hours for the development of tools , which we all can use under consideration of the &amp; GNU ; -@@ license . &quot;

&quot; &amp; k@@ sig ; is a graphical editor to manage many different signatures for e @-@ mails . by using the command line interface , you create random signatures or daily signatures from a list . this command line interface provides the signatures for external e @-@ mail programs such as &amp; k@@ mail ; &quot;
&quot; for random signatures , any signature will be read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig ; by many signatures with different quot@@ ations , styles and information , you can make your emails varied and unique . &quot;
&quot; for daily signatures the same signature is read from the signature file of &amp; k@@ sig for the whole day ; for each day , use different signatures , as with the random signature create unique emails . &quot;
&quot; to create a new signature , select C@@ trl ; N file New . this gives you a lt ; empty signature ; in the signature section . if you have entered your signature , save it with C@@ trl ; S file Save or click on the flo@@ ppy icon . &quot;
&quot; you can create as many signatures as you like . then you have a list of signatures for e @-@ mail programs such as e @-@ mail ; if you use e @-@ mails privately or professionally , there are always enough signatures . &quot;
&quot; to delete a signature , select it first and then remove it in the File menu or click on the icon with the red cross Rem@@ ove in the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; to change a short command , select an action from the list . to change a short command , select an action from the list . then click the Custom button in the bottom right corner of the button and enter the new short command by pressing the button or key combination . &quot;

&quot; by clicking a variable from the list , you get a summary information in the dialog below . if a variable is a particular expression , for example &quot;
&quot; if it contains , then a new X@@ Path can be selected by entering a new value for the variable expression and clicking the expression button . &quot;
&quot; when clicking a variable entry in the list , the text poin@@ ter will be transferred to the corresponding line of this file in the main window . &quot;
&quot; version 3.2 of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , contains many new &amp; XML ; tools and functions . these tools are unique in their integration in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . all these tools use com@@ man@@ ders as surface and lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 and lib@@ x@@ s@@ lt as a base . the combination results in fast , efficient , complete and productive tools . &quot;
&quot; everyone who has worked with the &amp; k@@ de ; documentation knows , and how outstanding it is . if we raise it a bit , we give it a graphical interface ! no more on a terminal . simply click the icon for the XML processor and done ! &quot;
&quot; this application expects a inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book in the folder . if inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is located in the wei@@ ghted working folder , then leave the current working folder . if not , then remove the selection of current working folders and specify the folder in the field of other folders . &quot;
output files are stored in the same folder as the source files . all previous &amp; HTML files are deleted every time my program starts .
&quot; as already said , anyone who has already worked on the &amp; k@@ de documentation knows how helpful this application is . and with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there is now a great graphical interface for that . &quot;
&quot; if the newly opened file inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is , then simply select the current working folder . if not , then select current working folders and enter the folder where inde@@ x.@@ doc@@ book is to be found . &quot;
&quot; if it comes to an issue on the screen , its file is defective . please check the reported errors and try again . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be reviewed is already marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , then the current file is simply hoo@@ ked up . if not , delete the file and select the file to be reviewed by another file - file selection . &quot;
&quot; if you just want to know if the file is well @-@ formed , click the Well @-@ formed Review Selec@@ ting . &quot;
&quot; to use a file specified in the &amp; XML ; file specified in the &amp; XML ; ( External ) , otherwise &amp; DT@@ D ; ( External ) and enter the location of the file . both for the W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema as well as for the Relax@@ NG check is the definition of the definition UR@@ I ; required in file selection . &quot;
&quot; yes , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; also has a &amp; X@@ SL ! application tool ! this is using the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c tool from the lib@@ x@@ ml@@ 2 library . &quot;
&quot; if the file to be processed should be marked in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the current file is simply selected . if not , remove the current file and select the file to be processed using the other file choos@@ er . &quot;
enter the name of the file as the result should have named . the file is usually stored in your home folder .
&quot; the plug @-@ ins , which &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; la@@ det , have with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , even possibly little to do . by doing so , the plugin system becomes very powerful . you can immediately benefit from the additional functionality and do not have to wait until someone uses the fake in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which can be used in a large number of &amp; GUI elements . &quot;
&quot; to install a plug @-@ in or a part , we start editing plug @-@ ins . this opens the following dialog : &quot;
this dialog allows you to manage and add all of the included plu@@ gins . we describe each &amp; GUI ; -@@ element :
here you can enter the search path . when adding plug @-@ ins without a storage location and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; this path to search the plug @-@ in .
often work on a project several persons in a sort of hierarch@@ ical relationship to each other . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; supports the statement of team members and these can be configured with Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties dialog .
the name and email entries are self explan@@ atory . nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the user and serves to uniquely identify .
&quot; a member can have several roles in the project , such as team leaders as well as sub@@ project leaders . &quot;
the user can select himself from the list of team members who he is . this happens by looking out the team member from the list and pressing the S@@ etze button . the currently selected member ( their identity ) appears fat after which they are : text .
nick@@ names and the setting of your own identity are important in terms of messages and comments . see for further information on comments .
&quot; in addition to an overview of their team , there is another advantage by capturing the members of the team : it can create an event for information to the team leaders when something specific happens . see for more information . &quot;
&quot; event actions are actions that are executed when something specific happens in the project . an example would be the opening of the opening and closing of the project , so that later on how much someone worked on it or sending a message when a file is backed up , or a script that will insert a file into CVS as soon as it is added to the project &amp; etc ; &quot;
&quot; on the Side Event configuration of the Shift ; F@@ 7 project project settings dialog , events can be created , edited and deleted . &quot;
an email will be sent to the add@@ res@@ see in the recipients list . the address can be a team or sub @-@ project manager . see how to set up such leaders .
notes are special comments in the documents . they differ from normal comments by the following things :
&quot; to add notes is simple . either the comment entry is selected from the editor context menu , or the @ ann@@ ot@@ ation keyword is entered in a comment area followed by comment text . &quot;
&quot; notes can be sent to a specific member of the team . in this case , the syntax @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( nick@@ name ) or @ ann@@ ot@@ ation ( role ) , where nick@@ name is the nick@@ name of the team member , plays a role in the project . &quot;
&quot; nick@@ names and roles names are case @-@ sensitive , but spaces around the par@@ enth@@ eses and the name are invalid . &quot;
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a development environment for scrip@@ ting and format@@ ting languages that is DT@@ D agnos@@ tic and supports web @-@ based format@@ ting and scrip@@ ting languages .
&quot; the settings can be reached via the Settings menu . here , only about &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , -@@ specific settings are treated , a short description for the others can be found . &quot;
&quot; the settings can be set up by means of settings Qu@@ anta . this dialog extends over some pages , which are treated one after the other . &quot;
the behavior of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; regarding tags including car completion can be changed with this . the entries are :
&quot; large / lower@@ case of tags : large / lower@@ case of automatically inserted tags . normal Groß / lower@@ case means , the tags are inserted in the way they are described in tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; upper@@ case / lower@@ case attributes : upper@@ case / lower@@ case of automatically inserted attributes . normal Groß / lower@@ case means , the attributes are inserted in the way they are described in tag@@ XML files . &quot;
&quot; optional tags automatically close : if ange@@ ha@@ kt , the tags for which the closing tag is optional , will be added immediately after the tag . &quot;
do not include optional tags : as above for all other tags except for the simple tags .
&quot; start and finish tag automatically update : when switched on , the respective closing tag will be changed and vice versa . &quot;
automatic setting of acc@@ ent characters : controls the automatic conversion of acc@@ ented characters into the corresponding encoding during typing .
MI@@ ME types : mim@@ et@@ yp@@ es for detection of different types of files .
standard character encoding : the encoding of newly created or in other ways than with file opening opened files ( where the encoding of the file can be ski@@ pped ) .
&quot; standard DT@@ D : the selected DT@@ D is used for newly created files , or for files whose DT@@ D is not recognized . &quot;
&quot; creating a backup copy : &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; creates backup copies regularly , so that during a power ou@@ tage or crash the document can be recovered from this backup . this is not the same as saving the file . &quot;
&quot; the preview and documentation can be previ@@ ewed either in the editor area or in your own view ( or the documentation in a tab ) , which makes it possible to view the documentation , preview and source code at the same time . &quot;
reset the window settings to the default back to the next start is useful when the user interface has occurred by modi@@ fying the M@@ DI modes and and@@ o@@ cking / depen@@ dencies of views . it corresponds to the --@@ res@@ et@@ ype command line parameter .
the warning message section is used to control the display of warnings by hooks of no more requests .
the place to change the behavior of the V@@ PL ; it can be set the display of symbols instead of scripts as well as the sync behavior of the V@@ PL@@ - and the source code view in shared mode . with regard to different modes see .
&quot; here the par@@ ser and the structure tree , which represents the illustration of par@@ ser no@@ des in the document , can be set in details . &quot;
&quot; in the mouse click on the structure tree , the following action is possible to change the action triggered by clicking on the structure tree with the mouse buttons . &quot;
&quot; in the structure tree settings , the visibility of no@@ des in the tree can be set automatically . empty no@@ des are the empty spaces in the text , while empty groups are those in which no element has been found in the current document . &quot;
&quot; abbrevi@@ ations are divided into groups , each can be valid for several &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; this means there can be a valid group for PHP , in which the i@@ f@@ clause short@@ cut means something different than in a group valid for Jav@@ ascript . &quot;
&quot; plug @-@ ins are managed by third parties , which can be re@@ used by any K@@ Part @-@ enabled application , the best known &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; when inser@@ ting a plug @-@ in , the following must be specified : &quot;
address : the path to the plugin if it is not located at a standard site such as $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / li@@ b .
&quot; input : this information will be given to the plugin at startup , so it can open the current file , the corresponding folder ( path of the current file ) or the project folder . &quot;
load a component in &quot; Only @-@ Read &quot; mode : check if the plugin refuses the load . only @-@ L@@ ese @-@ K@@ Parts usually refuse loading if this option is not selected .
&quot; check the plug @-@ in : if this is enabled , then test &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , if the entered information is correct . &quot;
&quot; for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , from version 3.3 , troubleshooting has been completely re@@ developed . the support for the no longer necessary built @-@ in &amp; PHP ; ( 3 ) Deb@@ u@@ gger has been set , as well as the support for the DB@@ G de@@ bu@@ gger . instead , a de@@ bu@@ gger plugin concept has been implemented that allows various implement@@ ations via plu@@ gins . &quot;
currently only one plugin is available which includes support for using &amp; gu@@ bed ; inqu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; using the de@@ bu@@ gger for a project begins with the selection of a suitable de@@ bu@@ gger plugin in the project settings . with the Options button beside the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin , the specific settings can be changed . &quot;
&quot; if a de@@ bu@@ gger is enabled for a project , some additional elements appear in the &quot; &quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus &quot; &quot; ; -@@ user interface : &quot;
a view in which the content of monitored variables is displayed . normally appears in the left dock .
&quot; a view , in which all the holding points , are listed with line numbers and conditions . usually appears in the bottom dock . &quot;
a view shown in the output ( as shown in HTML ) of the de@@ bu@@ gger . usually appears in the bottom dock .
&quot; depending on the supported functions of the de@@ bu@@ gger , everything or part of the following functionality is available . &quot;
&quot; this action will be used to connect to the de@@ bu@@ gger if necessary , or it tells the plugin to listen to Deb@@ u@@ gger requirements . this action is triggered by default when a project is opened which uses a de@@ bu@@ gger , so that normally doesn &apos;t have to pay attention to it . &quot;
the counterpart to Deb@@ ug@@ gen Session Star@@ ts the session . includes the connection to the de@@ bu@@ gger or termin@@ ates the noise according to requirements .
sends an HTTP request to the server to send a de@@ bug request . this is syn@@ onymous with the use of a browser to view the current document . the output of this request is displayed in the de@@ bu@@ gger issue view .
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start execution of the script and to send information about the monitored variables and the currently executed line . if this happens while the script is stopped , the execution will be continued . if it is started before a de@@ bug is started , the script will start with the request . &quot;
&quot; instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to start exec@@ uting the script without inform@@ ing information about the variables and the current line number . if this happens while a script is stopped , the execution continues . happens before a request is made , the execution begins as soon as a request is made . &quot;
the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script without going into the functions or include .
&quot; the de@@ bu@@ gger will execute the next instruction in the script , where possible mal@@ adjusted in functions and include . &quot;
instruc@@ ts the de@@ bu@@ gger to pass the instruction and proceed to the next as if there were not the current one .
&quot; opens a dialog in which a variable or expression can be entered , which is to be monitored . the monitored value appears in the variable view . &quot;
this dialog allows you to enter a variable or set a new value to a variable .
&amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a work by Keith Is@@ dale as well as this part of the documentation . &amp; k@@ x@@ s@@ l ; is a &amp; k@@ de ; front end and a part of x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g that they can find on ht@@ t@@ p : / / x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g@@ .@@ s@@ f.@@ net with many other works of Keith .
&quot; this chapter describes how you can be able to adapt to your needs , and how you can help them . &quot;
&quot; document type editing packages ( D@@ TE@@ P ; s ) are used in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to provide support for Mark@@ up@@ - and scrip@@ ting languages as well as &amp; CSS ; they enable &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . their simplicity and flexibility makes from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , a fast , user @-@ friendly &amp; IDE ; for web developers , easy to use and productive . &quot;
&quot; tag folders contain two file types , file &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag@@ XML files with extension .@@ tag@@ . tool@@ bars are handy , symbol @-@ oriented tool@@ bars of image buttons ( above the editing window ) , which can insert text and instructions more quickly into a document than one user could ever . &quot;
&quot; &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; s can be created manually ( see below ) , downloaded or created automatically from an existing DT@@ D . see for details of conversion . &quot;
&quot; this document describes how tag@@ XML files are to be created , then the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and also tool@@ bars . in short , one &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; . &quot;
Tag@@ XML files ( .@@ tag ) define both the specific attributes for tags as well as the layout and contents of the properties dialog that shows &amp; tor@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . file lists contain the rules and information of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; even . tool@@ bars allow a quick insertion of tags into a document without the risk of a write error .
&quot; tag folders are nothing but folders . they contain only file descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; and tag XML files . tag folder bear the name of the description language and version , so present . ( for example , html @-@ 4.@@ 01 @-@ strict ) &quot;
&quot; the table below lists the elements of Tag@@ XML and declares whether they are necessary or not . although not all necessary , it is advisable to use as many as possible so that other users have a better insight and more information in working with them . &quot;
the following chapter describes each element in detail . everything about the possibilities and limitations is explained in a simple way .
&quot; this is the root element of a Tag@@ XML document . it can only occur once in a document . it can contain the definition of many tags , but contains nothing else than nothing else . &quot;
the type of tag is a script function . when used is &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; an argument of the function . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the class class . the name of the base class for this class . ( only family 2 )
valid only for the type method . speci@@ fies the name of the class where this method belongs . ( only family 2 )
&quot; if yes , the tag has a common attribute group and attributes within this tag can be added to any other day . ( only family 1 ) &quot;
sets a text into the dialog . this text is defined by the &amp; lt ; text &gt; tag . this is a single element type element .
&quot; describes an attribute of a tag . this item can only occur once for each attribute . it speci@@ fies the name and type of the attribute . additionally , it contains additional tags describing how this attribute is to be displayed &amp; etc ; This is a single element type element . &quot;
speci@@ fies the source code used for filling in the tag editor dialog and in the attribute tree
requires source = d@@ co@@ p . the d@@ co@@ p interface within and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve source data .
requires source = d@@ co@@ p and the name of an interface . the d@@ co@@ p method name within and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is used to achieve the source of data .
&quot; requires source = d@@ co@@ p , a interface name and method name . the arguments passed to the method can be empty or % tag@@ name % , meaning the name of the current tag . &quot;
a container tag that groups the elements of a list together . it can occur only once for an attribute description . it is an element type element .
speci@@ fies the position of the attribute text of a tag within a dialog . this tag can only occur once each attribute in a dialog ( e.g. for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; tag ) . the element is empty .
speci@@ fies the position and size of a field in the dialog . this tag should be present for each field in the dialog ( e.g. one for each &amp; lt ; att@@ r &gt; and &amp; lt ; label &gt; Tag ) . this element is empty .
there is a list of elements which may occur within the tag to be defined . this element is a single element type .
gives a list of elements that end a day . this element is a single element type .
all Tag@@ XML files have to start with a &amp; XML ; &amp; lt ; ? XML version = 1.0 encoding = UT@@ F @-@ 8 ? &gt; and must be ne@@ atly ch@@ ained and closed .
&quot; spaces affect nothing , but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; and &amp; lt ; , especially in elements such as &amp; lt ; tool@@ tip &gt; , &amp; lt ; text &gt; will not cause a break , but some pieces of work would disappear . &quot;
to check the Tag@@ XML files the tool@@ bar is dialog above in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ window to start and check Tag@@ X@@ ML@@ . another dialog will appear to follow its simple instructions .
this function is currently not available . currently the check is performed only when the Tag@@ XML files are loaded in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
the following is an example of a family 1 Tag@@ XML file . this file describes the &amp; lt ; scheme &gt; element from the &amp; W3@@ C ; &amp; XML ; schema . the file name for this Tag@@ XML file should be schem@@ a.@@ tag .
the following is an example of a functioning family 2 Tag@@ XML file . in this file a &amp; PHP ; over@@ load function is described . the fil@@ en@@ ame of this Tag@@ XML file should be over@@ load@@ .@@ tag .
&amp; lt ; ? XML version = &quot; 1.0 &quot; encoding = &quot; UT@@ F @-@ 8 &quot; ? &gt; &amp; lt ; tag &gt; &amp; lt ; tag name = &quot; over@@ load &quot; type = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; att@@ r name = &quot; void &quot; &gt; &amp; lt ; / tag &gt; &amp; lt ; / tags &gt;
&quot; the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; file is just as simple and there is an editor for it , reachable via DT@@ D editing DT@@ D settings . thus , di@@ ed@@ es@@ cri@@ p@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; for a file sel@@ ectable &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; for a newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; should be created a simple &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; with the following entries : &quot;
&#91; general &#93; Version = Use 1 for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; version &amp; lt ; = 3.@@ 1.2 and 2 for each higher version . name = DT@@ D input . ( - / / W3@@ C ; / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ) Ni@@ ck@@ name = The simplified name of the DT@@ D . ( HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional ) . if not specified the name is used as nick@@ name .
an action can be set with settings actions ... created . click New action to the same dialog :
&quot; the keyboard short@@ cut assigned to this action . by clicking the Custom button , a short@@ cut can be assigned ; with K@@ one , the current keyboard short@@ cut can be removed . &quot;
the simplest actions . a text can be entered in the detailed settings and when performing the action this text is inserted in the document at the current cursor position . see the example below .
&quot; this is the most powerful action type . with the help of this action , external applications ( usually scripts , but it is not limited ) to change the document or use it as input ( or parts of the document ) can be started . examples from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , themselves are the quick start dialog or the various see in ... Ac@@ tions for the ( X ) HTML @-@ D@@ TE@@ Ps . &quot;
first you need to specify the name of the script and the interpreter . example : SH / home / my@@ Home / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh .
although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the % scrip@@ t@@ dir variable in command line such as sh % scrip@@ t@@ dir / my@@ Scrip@@ t.@@ sh@@ . In this way tries &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the script at the following locations : $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / scripts in their path : $ P@@ AT@@ H There are other special variables that can be used in the command line :
&quot; % f : we will replace the current document with the URL of the current document . in case of a local document , file : / from the document name will be removed . &quot;
&quot; % p@@ id : is replaced with the PID of the current &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . if by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , only one instance is running , the text is unique to the PID number . this is useful when D@@ CO@@ P is used to control &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which is used by the external script . &quot;
&quot; the parameters for this event , usually the file name of the current document or path to the project file . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the methods listed above , a script can be received from &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . input field input can be specified , which is to be sent to the default input . possibilities are : &quot;
selected text : the selected area of the document is sent to the script . the % input variable is usually only useful with this setting .
&quot; the output of the executed application can also be re@@ directed . there are two types of output : normal output , written to the standard output . it can be specified what to do with the text written to the standard output by the value of the output field output : &quot;
&quot; if there are many tags in the mark@@ up language , it is recommended to sub@@ divide the tags into logical groups . it is necessary for each group to create their own tool@@ bar . in the given case , there are not too many , therefore one can create a tool@@ bar with the name of the mark@@ up . &quot;
&quot; once a tool@@ bar is added , you need to add and configure actions . select Pre@@ ferences . &quot;
the parts of this window are pretty self explan@@ atory . press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode .
fill in all necessary fields and add the tag to the appropriate tool@@ bar .
&quot; complete everything and , if the tag has attributes and you plan their use , enable &quot; &quot; Edit Tag &quot; &quot; dialog when available , so that an input is possible when using the action . &quot;
Ig@@ itt ! is this an ug@@ ly symbol . who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol ? let &apos;s replace it before we have difficulty .
&quot; to create a symbol that the action is better represented , we will use and ki@@ do edit ; select from the &amp; K@@ Menu ; , Graphics other programs ( or where else it is located in their distribution ) . &quot;
&quot; &amp; ki@@ con@@ edit ; default 32@@ x@@ 32 pixel , but we need 22@@ x@@ 22 . to change this , select Edit size others . &quot;
&quot; please note that the created symbol does not only help you to remember what the action does , but also to all other users of the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the start of the day , I decided to create a start button as a symbol . by using green ( green is usually displayed as loose , rigid , further interpreted ) , or at least , a message to the user is sign@@ alled that clicking this symbol is a &amp; lt ; start@@ les ; tag in the current document will be inserted . &quot;
&quot; after creating the symbol it must still be connected with the action . this is done via the menu with settings actions ... ( in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , ) and selection of desired action . besides the text field there is a button , press it . &quot;
&quot; select the folder in which the saved symbol is located , select it and confirm with OK . &quot;
&quot; press the App@@ ly button and continue with other tags , if there are any , or confirm with OK to complete . &quot;
let &apos;s assume you want to add some common &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ functions to the tool@@ bar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separ@@ ators into several groups . open the tool bar to set dialog on Settings tool bars . make sure that the desired tool@@ bar is selected .
&quot; after selecting the element to be added to the tool@@ bar , press the arrow button to the right . this adds the item to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; for example , I would like to have a quick way to access the Kon@@ quer@@ or preview . I will select it and add it to the tool@@ bar . &quot;
please note how the separ@@ ators support group@@ ing . someone who does not know my tool@@ bar might believe that the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; -@@ button is the opposite of the start button .
the new tool@@ bar must be tested by hal@@ ving all symbols to ensure that everything works .
&quot; after New e@@ XML does not exist , it will be created in the root folder , but your tool@@ bar ( s ) should be stored in the correct folder . please adjust your tool@@ bar ( s ) when a file is opened by the corresponding type . &quot;
&quot; perhaps the most notable expansion of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scrip@@ ting language or the format@@ ting language that you like most . this is why this chapter describes how I create a &amp; PHP ; documentation tree for my personal use . &quot;
&quot; before starting your own documentation , you could check in the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , repository whether someone has already done that for you . &quot;
&quot; there are two parts in this process . first , you need to create an existing documentation for the format@@ ting / script / etc ; then you need to create the do@@ cr@@ c file . &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE configuration file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = path , relative to this file , for documentation HTML files e.g. ph@@ p@@ 42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Sec@@ tion@@ 1.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html Sec@@ 2.3 = Sec@@ 2.@@ html tag 2 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 2 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ .@@ html tag@@ 3 = tag@@ .@@ html &quot;
&quot; the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree . for example , see the &amp; PHP documentation for example : &quot;
&quot; # K@@ DE Con@@ fig file &#91; Tree &#93; Doc dir = ph@@ p@@ 42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = index of content , # Get@@ ting Star@@ ted , # Language Reference Table of Cont@@ ents = inde@@ x.@@ html Get@@ ting Star@@ ted = Intro@@ duction = langu@@ age@@ .@@ basic @-@ syn@@ tac@@ .@@ html ... &quot;
note the # before Get@@ ting Star@@ ted and Language Reference . this indicates that it is a sub@@ folder in the tree with its own content . there is no known limit for the depth of the box ( except by reason ) m@@ d@@ ash ; but try it yourself .
you notice that the table of contents is refer@@ enced directly to a file ( and conveniently located at the top end of the tree view &amp; m@@ d@@ ash ; folder is shown ! ) .
spaces affect nothing but pay attention to &amp; lt ; characters . these should be replaced by &amp; amp ; &amp; lt ; in all &amp; XML ; -@@ based &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . resources are replaced .
&quot; the content section is the area of the do@@ cr@@ c file , which is used to shape the context sensitive help . for example , when writing a &amp; PHP ; script the documentation for the my@@ sq@@ l _ fetch _ array function would appear . there are only two types of entries here : the context list ( context list ) and the file connection lines . &quot;
a simple list of contex@@ tual elements that should be available ( for &amp; PHP ; these are the functions of &amp; PHP ; ) .
now you can easily save your file do@@ cr@@ c and after $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ de / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / doc / Qu@@ anta / doc for local and global use . then create a folder ( like you specified it in your file do@@ cr@@ c ) in the same folder as do@@ cr@@ c and copy your HTML documentation to it .
&quot; if you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared , send your do@@ cr@@ c files with a description of important information , such as which documentation were used to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , community . they will not be rich , but be proud to have collabor@@ ated with the best web development platform . &quot;
&quot; with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you are not alone . it is possible to share the separ@@ able resources ( D@@ TE@@ P packages , tool@@ bars with actions , scripts , templates ) with others . there are two ways to do this : &quot;
&quot; the resources can be sent by email to friends , partners or anyone else . in different places there is an email @-@ sending menu entry , such as the DT@@ D DT@@ D package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) , sending email , tool@@ bar tool@@ bar with email , in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; the resources can be uploaded into our main archive , from where all other and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus users can download it . the contributions will be checked and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for the publication . in order to make an online contribution , the source of resources is guaranteed , both for our team and for the later users . &quot;
&quot; when up@@ loading you will be asked for your personal G@@ PG key after your pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase ( the pas@@ sp@@ hr@@ ase is not saved ) , or in the event that you have several keys , you can select one . in the dialog New Resource , the input fields must be filled ( URL preview can remain empty ) and click OK to start loading . &quot;
&quot; upload can be uploaded from the DT@@ D DT@@ D Package ( D@@ TE@@ P ) menus , upload tool bar tool@@ bar , and start in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree . &quot;
&quot; after downloading a resource , still before installation , examines &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing . in case of problems , it warns and it can then be canc@@ eled . please note the warning messages carefully . if integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly , a message appears with the specification of the source of the resource . &quot;
&quot; it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet by &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . however , the creation can be time @-@ consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tag@@ XML format . there is the simpler way to convert a DT@@ D into a D@@ TE@@ P package automatically . &quot;
&quot; the conversion can be started from the DT@@ D loading and converting a DT@@ D . select the .d@@ t@@ d file with the DT@@ D description , which should be used . after that , the following dialog appears : &quot;
destination directory name : the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; is written with this name in the $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / d@@ te@@ p folder .
&quot; Doc@@ type definition bar : the string that appears in the ! Doc@@ type Tag , such as HTML PU@@ B@@ LI@@ C - / / W3@@ C / / DT@@ D HTML 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional / / EN ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ w@@ 3.@@ org / TR / HTML@@ 4 / loos@@ e@@ .d@@ t@@ d &quot;
&quot; fine adjustment of the D@@ TE@@ P after conversion : if enabled , brings &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , after conversion the &amp; descrip@@ tion@@ r@@ c ; editor , with the details of the newly created &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; can be adapted . it is recommended to use this option . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , there are some key concepts . in order to understand them and to draw full benefit from them and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , they must first famili@@ arise themselves with these fundamental concepts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , the working area is divided into three areas : global , local and project @-@ related . this distinction concerns a number of components in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; global elements are stored for anyone who uses &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which is stored in the shared folder structure of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , which enables administrators to secure various tool bars , actions and patterns in the global tree , which will then be available to everyone in a multi @-@ user environment on the system . &quot;
local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user . these are user @-@ specific patterns and tool@@ bars . local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally .
project @-@ related elements are only available within a particular project . this can be anything from &amp; CSS ; patterns to tool@@ bars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project . simply said this is the most restricted size . all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project which em@@ its the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project .
&quot; the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ M@@ DI ; consists of several main areas : the editor window , the construction @-@ view , the cart@@ ons with information and the tool bars . &quot;
&quot; you can click the box flag with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document , such as the current , other or all card riders , rel@@ o@@ ad , delete or upload the document , skip to a bookmark or run CVS instructions on the current document . &quot;
&quot; right @-@ click in the editor area lead to another context menu with respect to the edited document content , such as basic editing steps ( cut / copy / paste ) , edit the tag under the mouse cursor , or open the file when the string under the mouse cursor is called a file . &quot;
&quot; at the top end of the editor window , the tool@@ bars of the editor are located . currently , &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , &amp; HTML ; 4.@@ 01 Transi@@ tional is a standard for which a set of tool@@ bars is displayed . &quot;
&quot; the use of tool@@ bars is really easy . if you want to insert a single tag , e.g. &amp; lt ; in your document , then click on the icon representing the tag . now you can enter the data for this just added tag . if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes ( such as anchor ) , you can fill in a dialog different fields . &quot;
&quot; the construction supervis@@ ors ( Q@@ IT ; ) allow you to navigate and navigate in the information to &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . in the presentation with flash@@ cards are available for files , project , sample templates , document structure , scripts , attributes and documentation . &quot;
&quot; project management is a powerful tool that provides &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . this view shows all files in the project and allows managing files in the project by right mouse click . actions such as adding , removing , up@@ loading or del@@ eting the files from the storage media can be done with the displayed context menu . &quot;
&quot; almost everything can be a template : pictures , program parts , a whole website , etc . all possibilities are open to you . &quot;
&quot; templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used . global templates are always available , local templates are always available , local templates are available only for the relevant user and templates in projects are only usable in the project . &quot;
&quot; here you can find information about the available scrip@@ ting languages . by clicking with the left mouse button , you can retrieve the available information to a script . &quot;
&quot; this view shows the internal structure of the active document . by clicking on an element , the cursor is placed in the document on the position of the element . &quot;
&quot; this tree appears among the other types of construction . it can quickly change attributes and nam@@ esp@@ aces . the application system , which is aligned to the content , enables the change of all available attributes with just a few mouse clicks . &quot;
&quot; here is the complete documentation of web technology for your development . pre @-@ packed documentation for &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , can be downloaded from qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you can create your own documentation , and by adding a folder doc to a project can be app@@ ended , edited and considered . &quot;
&quot; by default , and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , two anti@@ cs at the bottom of the window , can be reached via the useful information : the news window and the problem window . &quot;
&quot; this tab displays information about each script running in Qu@@ anta . for example , the currently used DT@@ D of the current document and all changes to the DT@@ D are displayed . &quot;
this tab card displays all errors in the mark@@ up of the current document . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ scripts executed perform all error messages ( so there are which ones ) in this window .
the tool@@ bars are expan@@ sive and easy to understand . show them on a symbol and they are given the corresponding command . the chocolate page of the tool@@ bars is the possibility to define their own commands as symbols in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
another feature of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . is the ability to send a tool@@ bar by email . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; sends the tool@@ bar as a compressed T@@ ar archive via &amp; k@@ mail ; if they receive a tool@@ bar in an email they can secure and load them in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus .
&quot; auto conf has a number of options that can be passed to the configure script . to get a complete list of all options , type . / configure --@@ help . the options are easy to understand and not executed here . &quot;
if you have problems with starting &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus you should check if your path contains the &amp; k@@ de ; 3 bin folders . also you should make sure that is not an older version of &amp; k@@ de ; 3 in the P@@ AT@@ H in front of its bin folder . the same goes for &amp; Q@@ t ; .
&amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; is a web development tool for the K@@ DE surface . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; optimized for rapid web development and combines a sophisticated development environment with a variety of powerful functions .
&quot; during the effort to create the best &amp; HTML editor , the developers of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus began to deal with an obvious idea : what if &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , would be an independent , exp@@ and@@ able mark@@ up editor ? well , this would make him the absolutely greatest web development tool for &amp; kiss ! so it was done . &quot;
&quot; no longer limited to pure &amp; HTML ; limited , is &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , now well on the way to a general and comprehensive web development tool . summ@@ arized : if you can define it in &amp; XML ; then , then you should be the appropriate and IDE ; &quot;
&quot; now , to the above claim must be recorded , that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; as a product based on the outstanding efforts of the entire &amp; k@@ de ; development community based . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; follows , in good application of free software , the idea of why developing what someone else developed ? thanks to the &amp; k@@ de ; sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding , it allows users and developers to expand as they need it for their needs . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , allows web developers to use an intuitive and powerful multi @-@ document surface ( M@@ DI ; ) . this can dramatically increase productivity . by means of self @-@ kn@@ itted actions , scripts and tool bars , automation can be increased almost any task . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus ; is a web development environment for HTML and related languages . it was designed for fast web development and quickly became a mature editor with many powerful functions .
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; Plus is not associated with commercial versions of &amp; Qu@@ anta ; the original developers left the GP@@ L licensed version and produced a commercial program .
&quot; more documentation is available with help : / Qu@@ anta ( either this URL in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or , or k@@ help@@ center help : / Qu@@ anta ) . &quot;
&amp; Qu@@ anta ; is currently being developed and supervised by Eric L@@ aff@@ ine Sequ@@ itur @ k@@ de@@ .org and Andr@@ as Man@@ tia am@@ anti@@ a @ k@@ de@@ .org .
&quot; a quick access list of files you have opened . each time you open a file that is not on it , the oldest entry is removed . &quot;
&quot; this allows you to save code parts and whole files as templates for later use . look at the templates section . if you try to save the selected file / text outside the local / project template folder , only one error will be reported . &quot;
&quot; when inser@@ ting from the clip@@ board there , special characters are converted to &amp; HTML ; sp@@ elling , so that they are displayed correctly and are not mis@@ understood by the browser as format@@ ting instruction . &quot;
&quot; converts the text from clip@@ board in &amp; URL , which is the correct way to insert specific characters and spaces in &amp; URL ; s . first and foremost to insert &amp; URL ; s used in the anchor tag . &quot;
switches the block selection to / off . this allows you to select text blocks using the &amp; Shift key .
go directly to a line number . this is very helpful when your &amp; PHP script releases error messages !
search a string or regular expression in the selected directory . a kind of gre@@ p or sed with GUI and pre@@ defined expressions to help you .
displays the message window or not . this is the window in which you see the display of script parti@@ tions and the de@@ bu@@ gger .
selecting and switching off the problem porter at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window . the problem re@@ porter will be activated as soon as you change to the structure tree .
displays the symbol column on the left of the main window . this column allows you to set book@@ marks with a mouse click .
&quot; if there are book@@ marks in the current file , they will appear in the menu along with the entries forward or next , depending on the cursor position in the document . &quot;
book@@ marks from other opened documents appear in the menu grouped by the file name of the other documents .
opens an existing project from the hard drive . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; -@@ Projects are stored with the file extension .@@ web@@ pr@@ j .
presented a dialog for inser@@ ting files into the current project . the selected files will then be copied to the project directory .
&quot; searches the project directory for new files that might be there . this allows , for example , to copy video files to your project folder or sub@@ folder and then add them to the project . &quot;
loads the files in your project to the server . the list of available transport methods depends on your version of &amp; k@@ de ; and if you have downloaded further input / output modules ( K@@ IO slaves ) .
&quot; settings , such as &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , are managed by the project . in chapter &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , you will find details . &quot;
loads a project tool@@ bar . these are stored in project / tool@@ bars and are only available in this menu if you have assigned them to this project .
a dialog to save your tool@@ bar . allows you to select the type of tool@@ bar : local or project .
&quot; opens a dialog to add a new tool@@ bar . this creates only the name . actions must be stored by means of settings ... added . tool@@ bars are stored on tool@@ bars tool@@ bars , or you will be asked if you want to save the tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; removes a tool@@ bar from the field of view . this does not delete it from the hard drive . if you haven &apos;t saved the tool@@ bar , you will be asked if you want to do that . &quot;
this allows you to send your own tool@@ bar to someone ( perhaps to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ) team so that the tool@@ bar is present in the next release ) . the menu item opens a new email message with the tool@@ bar as app@@ endi@@ x .
&quot; allows to upload tool bars to the main server , where everyone else can access it . see in . &quot;
loading a &amp; DT@@ D ; which has made you or anyone else and convert to the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . own description format .
&quot; load / refresh the entities from the &amp; DT@@ D ; it makes sense if the entities from the &amp; D@@ TE@@ P are to be fresh@@ ened up , without renew@@ ing the whole &amp; D@@ TE@@ P ; if this is global and a write permission in the global K@@ DE folder is not present , the store fails . &quot;
&quot; this menu contains a list of tags that are present in the currently loaded tool@@ bar . if the default ( HTML ; ) tool bar is loaded , there is a sub@@ menu standard in the Tags menu that contains the list of tags / actions on this tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; allows access to the current tag creation dialog when there is one . this entry is always present in the Tags menu , followed by &amp; DT@@ D ; -@@ specific sub@@ menus . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates or de@@ activ@@ ates the intelligent insertion of tags . currently , this only works with ( X ) HTML DT@@ Ds . intelligent insertion means that &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . inser@@ ting using the tool@@ bar means that this tag is contrary to the rules . &quot;
&quot; in the plu@@ gins menu , the available plug @-@ ins are listed under the menu items listed above . click on it . click on an activated plug @-@ in disabled . &quot;
sel@@ ects the syntax high@@ lighting mode for the current file . the list of available high@@ lighting schemes depends on the makes ; -@@ version .
&quot; select the type of line end identi@@ fier . very useful when you know people who use other OS platforms for developing . choose Unix , Windows / DOS or Macintosh . &quot;
checks the syntax of the current document based on the selected &amp; DT@@ D ; using the external application ti@@ dy .
&quot; immediate switching between the different types of user interface . due to some limitations in the K@@ DE libraries , switching can sometimes need time or create unpleasant graphics . recommended is the card @-@ card mode , which is also the default setting , or the sub@@ window mode , which corresponds to the representation in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , 3.2 and earlier . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this menu provides an entry for each open sub @-@ window . by selecting an entry , the corresponding sub @-@ window will be activated . &quot;
enables the display of the status bar at the bottom of the &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; main window on or off .
&quot; changes in this dialog affect any application that uses the K@@ HTML part , including the &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; web browser . &quot;
direc@@ ts the behaviour of the editor window . in the documentation of posters ; you can find details .
a dialog appears where you can delete entries from the tool@@ bar or add them and change the sequences .
&quot; this should generate a help according to the environment of the mouse cursor , but is not implemented yet . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , is a high @-@ quality product that is freely available and freely licensed , but as with any open source project developers can always use help . if they want to support &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , they find the way here . &quot;
&quot; the fields are self @-@ explan@@ atory and should be best completed from top to bottom , since , for example , after filling the project name , the whole directory structure will be completed automatically for the rest of the project . all these paths and author information fields can be adjusted later using Shift ; F@@ 7 Project Project Properties . &quot;
&quot; here is the name for the project , for example fo@@ o . when entering the name , file is filled automatically . &quot;
this is the name of the project file . by default it has the name of the project in lower@@ case and without spaces with the extension web@@ pr@@ j ( e.g. f@@ oo@@ .@@ web@@ pr@@ j ) . this file is stored in the project directory .
&quot; here you can enter the server address of the machine you want to access , except you edit local data . either a name ( host@@ nam@@ e.@@ un@@ .de ) or an IP address ( 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 ) are possible . &quot;
&quot; if you leave this field empty , the default settings of the selected protocol are used . depending on the remote machine setting , an adjustment might be necessary . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder where templates are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default templates . if a shared collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
&quot; this is the folder in which the tool@@ bars are stored for the project . it is a relative path to the project and by default Tool@@ bars . if a common collection of files is used for different projects , this folder should be set instead of the standard . &quot;
this allows to insert files from the local fil@@ esystem into the project . multiple files or entire folders can be selected .
&quot; this setting is great if you have static web content that you want to download and change . if you have ser@@ vers@@ ed scripts ( e.g. &amp; PHP ; , Python , &amp; etc ; ) you have to proceed differently . &quot;
&quot; if files that are located somewhere in the main folder of the project are to be attached . if a project is started from scratch , do not hook . &quot;
&quot; with this option , all files and folders within the main folder will be displayed and you can make an exact selection of good man@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; this shows a list of files in the root folder . you can select the desired files by hook or , by removing the tick , clips out of the project . &quot;
the last screen of the new project wizard contains three settings that simplify your work . these settings can be uploaded in the menu with Project Properties in the menu tree in the sub@@ window Profile or changed with Shift ; F@@ 7 .
some settings correspond to those in the Project Wiz@@ ard and are described in . the additional entries are explained below .
&quot; a list of file names ( wild@@ cards possible ) , which are ignored in project @-@ related operations such as project folders . &quot;
&quot; additional option to top , also files listed in .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore are excluded from the project . &quot;
the project view that is loaded when the project is opened . read more about project views .
this allows the de@@ bu@@ gger to be selected . currently only G@@ ub@@ ed is supported . more information about G@@ ub@@ ed can be found in . the de@@ bu@@ gger plugin can be set with the Options button . the troubleshooting is described in .
&quot; in the sub@@ window profiles , upload profiles ( see in ) can be set , as well as the display of a tree view for the contents of the server for each profile by clicking on your own tree view for each profile . &quot;
&quot; in the team configuration sub@@ window , project members can be added , edited or deleted as well as a mailing list . see the details . &quot;
&quot; in the event configuration window , you can turn event actions and add , modify or delete event actions . event actions are executed when a previously specific event occurs , such as the backup of a file . see the details . &quot;
by default it opens &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus ; the last project that was opened . you cannot influence this behavior at the moment .
to open another project select project ... from the Project or the icon project open from the tool@@ bar . the dialog Project will be displayed and allows selection of a project . projects have .@@ web@@ pr@@ j as an extension .
&quot; when &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus is closed , the project file is automatically saved . you will be asked if you want to save changes before leaving , when you find changed files . the same happens when you load a new project . &quot;
the project manager gives free access to the files in the project . there the files can be managed in the current project .
&quot; folders behave similarly , but the entries are missing open and opened with ... in the context menu pop@@ up with the right mouse button : &quot;
here you can choose different profiles . the profile contains information about the location of the uploaded files . see .
&quot; to remove the current profile . if there is only one profile available , the button will be blin@@ ded to prevent removal . &quot;
this option is useful when frequent up@@ loading of files is necessary and the rather in@@ secure password on the disk save option does not come into question .
this will stop the transmission or simply leave the dialog when you change your mind before up@@ loading .
&quot; in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , many upload profiles can be created to upload the project ( or parts of the project ) to different servers . when editing or creating a profile , this dialog appears : &quot;
this is the server &apos;s name on which the files should be copied . either a fully qualified domain name or an IP address will work .
&quot; the transfer protocol for up@@ loading . the list depends on the version of &amp; k@@ de ; and the installed ki@@ o slaves . at least , you should choose from &amp; FTP ; , file ( local ) and n@@ fs . &quot;
&quot; the port for the transfer . normally , this does not need to be changed , except the network administrator does not operate a service on the usual port . &quot;
&quot; depending on your fear threshold , this is either a time @-@ saving function or danger . use it after your discretion . the password is saved on the disk , so it cannot be read easily , but everyone with programming knowledge can easily see it in plain text . &quot;
&quot; a project view is only one set of files and tool@@ bars . there can be many views in a project , i.e. by simply do@@ cking the view , various files and tool@@ bars can be loaded and replace the currently opened files and tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; views can be saved , opened or deleted by the Project Tool@@ bar Project or Project tool@@ bar . &quot;
&quot; this chapter describes the parts of &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , with which one has to do most . this helps not only increase productivity but also allows the adaptation of and qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , to its own way of working . &quot;
&quot; as mentioned above , tool@@ bars in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus are best plu@@ gged through the tool@@ bar menu . use and addition vary . adding tool@@ bars is treated below in the addition of tool@@ bars . &quot;
&quot; the tool@@ bars and the symbols can be set either by means of context menu ( right @-@ click on the tool@@ bar ) , in which the new action , a new tool@@ bar can be executed , which can be specified in the dialog where you can indicate which actions on this or other tool@@ bars should be visible . &quot;
&quot; by calling the context menu to an action ( icon ) on a tool@@ bar , additional entries will be removed and action processed which are self explan@@ atory . &quot;
the tool@@ bars and the actions on them can be set up in the menu with settings tool@@ bars ... and set settings for actions .
&quot; templates are basically documents skel@@ et@@ ons , code cut@@ lets and files for linking . &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , uses templates basically like a common file system with advanced organization and interfaces . &quot;
some with &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . delivered templates have conditions for their use . please read the conditions specified at the beginning of each template before use .
&quot; binary templates are normally included in documents using links ( e.g. images with im@@ g sr@@ c = / sr@@ c / ur@@ l ) . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . for more information on the template tree is available . &quot;
&quot; documents can be written by any text document type . on the basis of these templates , new documents can be created . normally , more detailed documents can be created in appropriate sub@@ folders . you make a simple framework for the purpose and organize the work in an appropriate way to be efficient . some examples can be found in the template tree under global templates . see in for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; this kind of template is useful when not creating a new document based on a template , but the same text area again and again in the documents . you can find everything from a comment on a final note to a complete menu system on Jav@@ ascript or Perl @-@ based . see in for more information on the template tree . &quot;
&quot; as the name says , these templates serve as templates for whole websites . they are a collection of various documents organized in a folder structure , summ@@ arized in a compressed tar archive . currently there are no examples in &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus . &quot;
&quot; create a document structure at will ( XML ; , &amp; HTML ; , Doc@@ Book &amp; etc ; . ) and select File as template Save As local template .... &quot;
&quot; once this has been done , you will notice that ( even if it was saved as a project template ) the template is not visible in the project tree . look at the template tree under project templates . &quot;
&quot; select text in your document and click &quot; &quot; Save As template &quot; &quot; as a local / project template . alternatively , the selection can be easily dra@@ gged and dropped onto the tree view templates . &quot;
&quot; creating binary templates is simple : just copy the file into a template folder . it can be used for all file management functions for it , such as dra@@ gging and dropping or past@@ ing over the file tree of Kon@@ quer@@ or . &quot;
&quot; you can click on a folder on the right and create a site template in the file tree or in the project files , to enter a name for the template and backup . by default it is backed up in the project folder , but of course it can be stored as a local or global template . &quot;
&quot; project templates enable a very target @-@ oriented approach . you can submit header lines and foot@@ ers or dynamically use &amp; PHP ; design , insert files or link them with them . additionally , you can keep an eye on some things when using templates in projects . &quot;
the template structure in the sub@@ window Tem@@ plates is based on the files submitted in $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / apps / Qu@@ anta / Share / apps / Qu@@ anta / templates / Qu@@ anta / templates . each of these folders is one of four types of container as explained above .
&quot; to specify the behavior of a folder , right @-@ click on the folder and select properties in the context menu . the following dialog appears : &quot;
&quot; a selection box with the three previously described types ; files , text or templates . &quot;
&quot; this is enabled by default and fits all except the root folders in the template overview . if a root folder is set in such a way , it would be explicitly disabled in this path unless they were explicitly enabled . in case of a normal folder , the b@@ lah would appear with something like text module . if nothing appears , you will probably find yourself in a root folder . &quot;
this could be general head@@ lines or foot@@ ers for all templates for a particular project and allows to copy content templates to a folder with special head@@ lines / foot@@ ers a whole presentation with the appropriate header lines / foot@@ ers .
&quot; in addition , you have a context menu ( show right mouse button ) via a complete command collection for adding folders or copying and past@@ ing templates from one place to another . &quot;
&quot; &amp; qu@@ ant@@ ap@@ lus , offers two modes : V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and V@@ PL ; &amp; Source Editor that can be reached via the View menu . the first mode replaces the source editor by the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the second divi@@ des the editor window into two parts : the source text editor and the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ PL ; editor works as follows : it loads a document like a normal &amp; HTML ; - or &amp; X@@ HTML ; page and a cursor appears . then you can edit and switch back to source code editor , where the changes in the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor are visible in the source code . &quot;
&quot; when working with the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor on a document that contains &amp; PHP ; it is not possible to edit it directly using the V@@ PL ; editor . it is not possible to edit it directly using the V@@ PL ; editor . to edit it , the source code editor is still necessary . there are no plans to change this behavior . &quot;
&quot; the second mode works just like the first , except that simultaneously the changes in both the source editor and the V@@ PL ; editor are visible and the cursor is already active in the source text editor and in the V@@ PL ; editor is already active , the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ ke is activated from one window to another , maintaining the position in the document . &quot;
&quot; the synchron@@ isation distance between the V@@ PL ; -@@ Editor and the source code editor is adjustable via settings Qu@@ anta .... After choosing V@@ PL , you can choose between synchron@@ isation after one click or automatically . in principle , the time interval can be set automatically . &quot;
&quot; assuming you want to change the title of the website , it is possible to choose the title of the website , so the editing of invisible tags is possible when working with the V@@ PL ; editor . the document properties dialog is also called as soon as a new document is created using the V@@ PL ; editor . &quot;
&quot; met@@ a @-@ tags allow storage of information about the document itself , e.g. keywords for Internet search engines . met@@ a elements can be added or removed by pressing the two buttons below or removed . &quot;
CSS rules are the new way of looking for pages in your browser . you can add or delete CSS rules with the buttons below the list . a change over the list is just as possible with the Met@@ a elements . editing CSS rules is currently not supported .
it is possible to include an external CSS style template by pressing the file @-@ open button and selecting the appropriate file .
&quot; the use of the cursor is possible as in a word processor , due to moving with the arrows . under rare circumstances the cursor is peculiar . the marker works as usual . text can be inserted by typing and del@@ etes by button or removal key . &quot;
&quot; inser@@ ting tags is done in the same way over the tool@@ bar , as in the source text editor . note that inser@@ ting tags previously already existing identical tags is not removed e.g. when an anchor tag , surrounded with text , must be removed any other surrounding anchor tag . &quot;
&quot; some tool@@ bars such as the table wizard or the Listen Wiz@@ ard are disabled . they will work later in &amp; V@@ PL ; in this release , the tables or lists of tool@@ bars must be used . &quot;
&quot; &amp; x@@ s@@ ld@@ b@@ g ; is a tool for the study of style sheets . in contrast to other programs for style sheets , the search for certain elements is possible and the design of the style template can be followed . &quot;

there are many graphical tools to compare . why so &amp; k@@ ward 3 ; ? let me briefly explain why I wrote .
&quot; the merge was very complicated , because one of the contribut@@ ors made many changes and at the same time had corrected the ind@@ entation at many places . another program@@ mer had changed a lot of text in the same file . the result was numerous conflicts in merging . &quot;
&quot; the program used by me showed me only the changed lines , but I could not see what had changed within these lines . and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the ind@@ entation had changed . merging these changes was a small night@@ mare . &quot;
this was the beginning . the first version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters . later a lot of other useful functions were added .
&quot; for example , if you want to compare text quickly , simply copy it to the clip@@ board and paste it into one of the comparison window . &quot;
a function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders . this function turned &amp; k@@ ward 3 ; almost into a full @-@ fle@@ dged file browser .
this is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes . the merge editor below the differences windows allows to resolve conflicts and at the same time display the expected result . this editor allows you to edit the result even directly . the screen@@ shot shows three source files when merging :
&amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; also helps you compare and merge complete folders . this screen@@ shot shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; when merging :
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today &apos;s color monitors . if you often need to check codes , you will like this function . &quot;
&quot; differences in white signs and tab@@ s are displayed visible . if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs , one can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side . ( no more trouble if somebody changes the ind@@ entation . ) &quot;
&quot; if a file is the same and the other is different in one line , the color indicates which file is different . red color means that both are different . &quot;
&quot; if all files have the same name but are in different folders , then you can make the typing work easier by just writing the file name of the first file completely . example : &quot;
&quot; diff@@ 3 folder 1 folder , folder 2 folder , folder 2 folder , folder 2 folder folder , folder 2 folder folder , folder 2 folder folder &quot;
&quot; opening dialog allows manually typing file names , selecting the file browser ( file ... ) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop @-@ down list . &quot;
&quot; using the Fol@@ der button ... you can also select a folder . if you select a folder , the compar@@ isons or merging of folders will be initiated . if a file is selected for A , however , a folder will be used for B and C , then use &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the file name from A in the other two folders . &quot;
&quot; if merging is enabled , the input field is active for the target and can be edited . however , it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file . you can also do this step later when saving . &quot;
the Con@@ figuration button opens a dialog with settings . you can set options here before you start merging / merging .
&quot; sometimes you don &apos;t want to compare a whole file , but only parts of a text . &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; allows you to drag text parts from the clip@@ board into the active comparison window . in the opening dialog you do not need to select files , you can simply close the dialog with the Canc@@ el button . &quot;
you can also use drag and drop : just drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window .
&quot; sometimes a file contains several similar functions . if you want to find out how similar these functions are , it would be a relatively big effort . you would need to create two corresponding files , upload them and then compare them . now you can simply copy , paste and then compare the relevant sections . &quot;
&quot; note : currently , you can &apos;t extract anything from &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported . &quot;
warning : some editors interpret pulling and dropping text into another program as cutting and past@@ ing ( instead of copying and past@@ ing ) . in such a case your original data could be lost .
&quot; the info line of the source pane contains the characters A , B or C , the fil@@ en@@ ame and the line number of the first visible line in the window . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( note that window C is optional . ) Any info line has a different color . ( note that window C is optional . ) &quot;
&quot; the three source windows are assigned the letters A , B and C. A has the color blue , B the color green and C is ma@@ gent@@ a . ( these preferences can be changed via the settings menu . ) &quot;
&quot; when a difference is detected , you can see the color , which file is different . if both files differ , the default color for it is red . ( color for conflicts in the settings ) . the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files . that &apos;s good in the next section . &quot;
&quot; when differences are found , the column shows the corresponding color . in some programming languages where white characters are not so important , it is useful to see only the relevant changes . ( at C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments , for the pre@@ processor and in few , rare cases . ) &quot;
&quot; the vertical line separating the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines . if the line breaks are activated , the line will be scored on a broken line . &quot;
&quot; the result window ( below the comparison windows ) also has an info line with the wording output : , the fil@@ en@@ ame and &#91; Tab &#93; if you edited the result . usually it contains text by automatic merging , but often it also contains conflicts . &quot;
! ! ! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is de@@ activated ! ! ! ( use the buttons S@@ prin@@ ge to the next solved / un@@ resolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts . )
&quot; if only two compar@@ ators are used , each difference must be solved at the same time a conflict which has to be solved manually . &quot;
&quot; by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows , the group belonging to the row will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed . &quot;
&quot; sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging , or by manual editing ; this is only a plac@@ eholder in the case that you change your mind , and perhaps select another source . this text will not appear in the final saved file , nor in a selection you may want to copy and paste elsewhere . &quot;
&quot; the text &amp; lt ; merge conflic@@ ted ; however , appears in the clip@@ board when you copy such text from the result window . be careful with this function . &quot;
&quot; note : when selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or ignore Ign@@ oram@@ ere C / C + + comments , changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters . &quot;
&quot; navig@@ ating is mainly used with the scroll bars and the mouse , but you can also use the keyboard . if you click in one of the windows , you can use the arrow keys on the left , right , up , side up , page , beginning , end , string beginning and string end , see how you can also use it from other programs . &quot;
&quot; in the dispens@@ ing window , you can also use the other buttons to edit . using the In@@ sert button , you can switch between insert and over@@ write mode . ( default is the insert mode . ) &quot;
one click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchron@@ izes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group ( as already explained in the merging and the edi@@ table output window ) .
&quot; the tool@@ bar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference , to the next / previous difference ( C@@ trl @-@ bottom / C@@ trl @-@ Up ) , to the next / previous conflict ( C@@ trl @-@ Picture Up / C@@ trl @-@ Picture Sli@@ de ) or to the next / previous conflict . &quot;
&quot; to copy the selection to the clip@@ board , press the Copy button ( C@@ trl @-@ C or C@@ trl @-@ In@@ sert ) . there is also the option selection automatically copy . if this is enabled , you automatically copy whatever you tick and copy the manual copy . be careful with this option , because you might like to over@@ write the contents of the clip@@ board by mistake . &quot;
&quot; line ends are saved according to the underlying operating system . Unix flavors use a new@@ line character \ , and Win32 @-@ based systems use cart return + line feed \ \ r \ . K@@ Diff@@ 3 does not keep the line end of the source files , therefore you should not use bin@@ aries . &quot;
the options and the list of most recently used files will be saved automatically when they are finished and restored at the next start . ( Menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... )
&quot; select a font with fixed width . ( on some systems , the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from , but you should not use them . ) &quot;
&quot; if you enable this option , differences in itali@@ c script will be displayed . if the selected font does not support this display , nothing happens . &quot;
&quot; on systems with only 16 or 256 colors , some colors could not be available in their pure form but would be displayed ast@@ ert . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , the corresponding number of spaces is inserted when pressing the tab key . otherwise , a tab@@ ul@@ ator character is inserted . &quot;
&quot; if you press or press return , the entry of the previous line will automatically be used for the next line . &quot;
&quot; when this option is checked , each selection is automatically copied to the clip@@ board . copy the manual copy to the clip@@ board . &quot;
you can select which line end type you prefer to save . the default value is the commonly used selection on the operating system used .
&quot; when comparing files , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 tries to find all completely identical lines in the source files . only during this first step , white marks can be ignored . the second step compar@@ es each line . &quot;
&quot; some editors ( on some systems ) save a cart return character &apos; \ \ r &apos; and a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; at the end of a line , others in turn save only a new@@ line &apos; \ &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in the first part of the analysis , numbers and associated characters ( &apos; 0 &apos; - &apos; 9 &apos; , &apos; . &apos; , &apos; - &apos; ) are ignored . in the result , the differences are still displayed , but they are treated as white marks . &quot;
&quot; in default , this option is disabled . changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters . &quot;
&quot; search intensively for even smaller differences . the option is enabled in default . it is effective in complex and large files , but slow with very large files . &quot;
&quot; in automatic jump mode , this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next un@@ solved conflict is ski@@ pped . &quot;
&quot; automatically triggers all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source . ( default is manual selection . ) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important . if you only need this from time to time , then use the functions Select A / B / C for all un@@ resolved white conflicts from the merge menu . note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments . &quot;
these options are handled in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge . look for details under documentation to compare and merge .
&quot; if a file is stored and already exists an older version , the original version will be app@@ ended to the suff@@ ix .@@ or@@ g. if already such a backup file exists with the suff@@ ix .@@ or@@ g , it will be deleted without further backup . &quot;
&quot; adjust the language of the interface . changing this option does not affect the current running program . you need to exit and restart , so that the change becomes active . ( this option is available in the K@@ DE version of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; not available because language is set there globally via the control center . ) &quot;
&quot; the following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately . if enabled , the upper setting is used for all entries . &quot;
&quot; in the selection fields for encoding , a short reference appears , which is the local encoding . ( this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you . ) &quot;
&quot; adjust the file encoding for source files . this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted . since encoding for each file is individually configur@@ able , even files with different coding can be compared and merged . &quot;
&quot; if you have edited a file , you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving . &quot;
&quot; if you define pre@@ processing commands , they might not work with your co@@ dec . ( for example , your files may be 16 bit Uni@@ code , but the pre @-@ processing command can only deal with 8 @-@ bit ASCII . ) With this option you can specify the encoding of output of pre@@ processor commands . &quot;
turn off this to supp@@ ress high@@ lighting changes in white characters in text or review columns . ( note : this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments . )
&quot; this selection is only available if you compare three files . in normal mode , all differences are displayed in a color @-@ co@@ ded over@@ sight column . but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files . &quot;
sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines . simply stop the less important windows . ( this option is in the window menu . )
arran@@ ges the comparison window by side or overl@@ apping . this can also be useful for displaying long lines . ( this option is in the Windows menu . )
&quot; sometimes you see the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files . a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file . ( if this function is used to restart the merge , then the name of the last used output file will be retained . ) &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . in &amp; k@@ ward 3 ; then the output of the command is visible , and not the file itself . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . &quot;
&quot; when reading a file , it will first pass this external command . if a normal pre @-@ processing command is also specified ( see above ) , then the output of the command is the input of this command . you can write your own pre@@ processor that matches your requirements . each input line must have a corresponding output line . &quot;
&quot; the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the di@@ ff results . however , an external program is required , and most users do not want to program it themselves . however , the good news is that in most cases sed or per@@ l completely suff@@ ice . &quot;
&quot; use this pre@@ processing command for new@@ lines to convert the input into capital letters : SE@@ D &apos;s / \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
CVS and other version control systems use some keywords to automatically add generated strings ( info : / c@@ vs / Key@@ word sub@@ stitution ) . all follow the same pattern $ Key@@ word generated text $ . now a pre @-@ processing command for new@@ lines is needed . the \ \ \ \ $ \ $ \ $ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ $ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \
while you experiment with sed you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions . they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things .
&quot; ignor@@ ing numbers is actually an already built @-@ in function in K@@ Diff@@ 3 . but it is good as an example of another pre@@ processing command for new@@ lines . sed &apos;s / &#91; 0@@ 12@@ 3@@ 45@@ 67@@ 8@@ 9.@@ - &#93; / / g &apos; E@@ ach sign between &apos; &#91; and &apos; &#93; &apos; is a hit , and each hit is replaced by nothing , so quasi deleted . &quot;
sometimes you may want to perform several re@@ plac@@ ements at one time . then you can use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on &apos; ; &apos; to separate the compositions . for example :
instead of sed you can also use something else like per@@ l -@@ p -@@ e &apos;s / Reg@@ Ex@@ p / replacement / SCH@@ AL@@ TER &apos; How@@ ever there are some details different . where sed \ \ ( and \ \ ) is needed per@@ l only needs ( and ) without the leading &apos; \ \ &apos; . example :
&quot; the data after the normal pre@@ processor will be maintained for displaying and merging . further operations change only the data , which sees the line reconciliation algorithm . &quot;
&quot; note : in rare cases when using a normal pre@@ processor , the new@@ line pre@@ processor sees the output of the normal pre@@ processor as input . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ processor commands are very useful , but as with any function that changes text or hides differences , you may acci@@ dentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case . &quot;
&quot; often programmers need to edit many files in a folder . for this reason , you can compare and merge the entire folder recur@@ sively . &quot;
... &quot; makes a proposal for each object to merge ; you can adjust the proposal before the start , &quot;
... can simulate the merging and display the simulated changes without really performing them .
... &quot; performs selected actions either with all ( F@@ 7 key ) , or only with selected objects ( F@@ 6 key ) , &quot;
this is very similar to the compar@@ isons and merging of individual files . you only have to specify folders on the command line or in the dialog .
&quot; if three folders are merged , folder 1 is used as the base . if no destination folder is specified , &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; folder 3 as destination folder . &quot;
&quot; note that only the comparison of folders will automatically start , not merging . to start merging , you need to select the corresponding menu entry or press the F@@ 7 key . ( more details will follow ) &quot;
&quot; while reading the folder , you will be informed about the current progress of a small news window . if you cancel the scanning of folders , only the files that have been compared to that date will be listed . &quot;
&quot; when scanning the folder is complete , shows &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; a list window with the results on the left , ... &quot;
each file and folder found during the scan is shown here in a tree . you can select an object with a simple mouse click .
&quot; the folder structure is usually folded together . you can fold a folder by clicking on the + / - click on the object , or by using the arrow keys for left / right . the directory menu includes two functions to fold all sub@@ directories and fold all sub@@ directories with which you can open or fold all folders . &quot;
&quot; if you double @-@ click on a file , the file comparison will be started and a comparison window will appear . &quot;
the symbol in column Name reflects the file type in the first folder ( A ) again . these types are possible :
&quot; if the file type is different in the other folders , then this is visible in the A / B / C columns and in the details pane to the selected object . in such a case , the merge action cannot be selected automatically . &quot;
&quot; as seen in the picture above , the colors red , green , yellow and black are used in the A / B / C columns . &quot;
&quot; in identical entries , however , the color is also identical , even if the age of the entries is different . &quot;
folders are viewed as identical when their entire content is identical . then folders also have the same color . in folders the age is ir@@ relevant for its color .
&quot; the idea of this color scheme is based on dir@@ di@@ ff . the colors reflect the colors of a leaf which is only green , then yellow becomes yellow and later , when it is old , red . &quot;
&quot; a and C are identical , but not B : copy of B ( or if B does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A and B are identical , but not C : copy C ( or if C does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; B and C are identical , but not A : copy of A ( or if A does not exist , delete the target if it exists ) &quot;
... &quot; A , B and C do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merging cannot be started . &quot;
... &quot; A and B do not have the same file type ( e.g. if A is a folder and B file ) : errors : conflic@@ ting file types . as long as such defective objects exist , the merging cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; mode to synchron@@ ize is active when only two folders and no explicit target folder have been specified , and when the option directories are synchron@@ ized . then choose the necessary action so that later both folders are identical . if for an entry ... &quot;
... A and B exist but are not identical : merge and save the result in both folders . ( the user sees as visible fil@@ en@@ ames for the output file only B ; copied directly after merging &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; B to A. )
&quot; when two folders are merged and select the New file instead of merge ( unsure ) is enabled , then examines &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; the date of the files and suggests the newer file to copy . if the files are different , but the date is identical .. Sol@@ ange these errors are not removed , the merging of the folders cannot be started . &quot;
&quot; during merging , one file is processed after the other . it status column shows skill when merging successful , and accordingly other messages when something unexpected occurred . if the merging is complete , you should make a final check and see if the status is all right . &quot;
&quot; if in the Setup dialog the file comparison method is selected Full Analysis , K@@ Diff@@ 3 will display more columns . these contain the number of un@@ solved , dissolved , non @-@ white and white conflicts . ( the column for resolved conflicts is only shown when three folders are compared or merged . ) &quot;
&quot; you can either merge the currently selected entry ( file or odds ) , or all entries at once . if you have selected all the matches ( including all sub@@ folders ) , you can start merging . &quot;
&quot; please note : if you do not specify a destination folder , then you will use C as the target in the 3 @-@ Fol@@ der Con@@ gregation mode . B is chosen as the target and when synchron@@ izing A and / or B is used as the target . &quot;
&quot; if you have selected a destination folder , please check that all entries that should be in the destination folder will also be displayed in the folder structure . there are some options that may be ski@@ pped in the folder structure . check these options to avoid unpleasant surprises : &quot;
to merge all entries : select directory merge / continue in the menu menu or press F@@ 7 ( the short@@ cut ) . in order to only merge the current entry : select action of the current element or press F@@ 6 .
&quot; if the conflic@@ ting file types still exist invalid merging actions , a message indicating the defective elements appears . you can then select a valid action for them . &quot;
&quot; when you merge all the entries , a dialogue window appears with the options passing , simul@@ ating and breaking . &quot;
select Sam@@ ples if you want to see what would happen without actually making any changes . you will then receive a detailed list of all actions .
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; then performs certain actions with all entries . if a manual intervention is necessary ( merging a single file ) , then a merge @-@ window will open ( note the screen@@ shot ) . &quot;
&quot; if you are finished with a file , select another directory entry again / continue or press F@@ 7 . if you haven &apos;t yet saved it , a corresponding dialog appears . then &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; its work will continue with the next entry . &quot;
&quot; in the end of the list you will see some error messages that will help you to try again , or skip the problem entry . so you have the option to select another action for the entry or to solve the problem in other ways before you continue merging . &quot;
&quot; if some entries have been merged individually , you notice &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; these entries ( in the current session ) and will not work together again when merging all entries . even if the merge operation has been ski@@ pped or not saved , these entries will be merged again . only if you change the merge action , these entries are merged again . &quot;
the Settings menu of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; ( menu Settings - &gt; K@@ Diff@@ 3 set up ... ) now has a section called directory merge with these options :
only files that fit on the indicated pattern are displayed in the element tree . separate the pattern with a sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; . valid plac@@ eholders : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . the default is * . folders do not have to correspond to that pattern .
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
&quot; files and folders that match this pattern are not displayed in the element tree . it can be entered more than one pattern , use the sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ; as separ@@ ator . valid wild@@ card : &apos; * &apos; and &apos; ? &apos; . default is * .@@ ori@@ g ; * .@@ o . &quot;
ignored files that would also be ignored by CVS . many aut@@ mati@@ cally generated files are ignored by CVS . the big advantage is that this folder @-@ specific file can be set with a .@@ c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore file . ( see info : / c@@ vs / c@@ v@@ sign@@ ore . )
&quot; in some file systems , files have a default attribute . in other file systems , a previous point is selected . this option lets you decide whether these files should be displayed in the element tree or not . this option is turned on in default . &quot;
&quot; when the option is switched off , symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the files will be compared to which the links show . this is de@@ activated in default . &quot;
&quot; links to folders : when the option is switched off , the symbolic links are compared . if the option is enabled , the links like normal folders will be treated and recur@@ sively searched . ( note that this option contains a link to itself would result in a loop and &amp; k@@ ward 3 ; crashes . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; complete analysis is slower than a simple binary analysis , and much slower when applied to files that do not contain any text . ( enter a corresponding anti @-@ pattern . ) &quot;
&quot; if you compare large folders through a slow network , it may be faster to compare the change date and file size . however , this speed advantage will cost you a certain level of security . please use caution . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; the files are considered identical if they are equal . this may , for example , be useful when copying the change date . please use caution . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; activ@@ ates the synchron@@ isation mode when two folders are compared and no destination folder is specified . in this mode , the suggestions for merging files are selected so that later both folders are identical . also the results of merging files are stored in both folders . this option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if there are differences , the copying of the newer file will be suggested as an action instead of merging the newer file . ( this is considered uns@@ af@@ e , because it is assumed that the other file has not been modified . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if a file or folder is replaced or deleted by another , then the original version will be renamed and gets the extension .@@ orig@@ . If an old backup file is already existing with the .@@ or@@ g extension , this will also be deleted without further backup . this also applies to the normal merging of individual files , not only merging entire folders . this option is turned on in default . &quot;
&quot; normally , the folder merge view stays visible while merging individual files ; you can move the window divi@@ der with the mouse . if you do not want this , you can switch the window divi@@ der in the window menu and switch between the two views using a change between directory and text window . &quot;
&quot; you probably prefer to compare a file by double @-@ clicking . however , there is also a corresponding menu entry in the menu menu . you can also directly merge a single file without having to start the folder . &quot;
&quot; however , this status will be lost when you re @-@ read the directory : &quot;
K@@ DE supports network transparency with the help of K@@ IO slaves . K@@ DE uses this to read files and folders . this allows you to specify files and folders to open them on local or remote hosts .
the first command line compar@@ es a local file to an FTP server . the second command line compar@@ es a folder within a compressed archive with a local folder .
a URL has a different syntax than local files and folders .
&quot; a path can be relative , or .. contain . this is not possible with URLs , these are always absolute . &quot;
&quot; special characters must be mas@@ ked . ( # - &gt; % 23 , blank &gt; % 20 , etc . ) . for example , a file with the name / # fo@@ o # has the URL file : / % 23@@ fo@@ o % 23 . &quot;
&quot; sometimes due to the file system on the server , sometimes through the protocol used . it follows a short list of limitations : &quot;
&quot; or it cannot be distinguished whether a link to a file or folder shows . then , a file is always accepted as a link target . ( FTP : , s@@ ft@@ p : ) . &quot;
&quot; there is no way to edit per@@ missions or change date . therefore , the per@@ missions or modification date devi@@ ate from the original . ( note the option Con@@ fi@@ denti@@ al of the size . ) ( this is only possible with local files . ) &quot;
&quot; the main purpose of use is at present as a difference viewer in K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP . K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OR first always starts the built @-@ in difference viewer . to start K@@ DE@@ V@@ EL@@ OP , press the right mouse button on the difference viewer and then select In K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part from the context menu . &quot;
&quot; normally requires &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; two full input files . however , if it is applied as a part , the file will take a patch file . at least one of the two files must exist . at least one of the two files must exist . then starts &amp; k@@ ward 3 ; the program patch to restore the missing file . &quot;
&quot; in the kon@@ quer@@ or you can click on a patch file and select from the context menu preview in - K@@ Diff@@ 3@@ Part . please note that this does not work if none of the original files exists . furthermore , this is un@@ reliable if the original files have changed since the creation of the patch file . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; as Part is executed , it only supports compar@@ isons of two files , a very small tool@@ bar and menu . merging or comparing folders is not supported in the K@@ Part mode . &quot;
&quot; tools with the name K@@ Di@@ ff and K@@ Diff@@ user ( now hei@@ st compact ) already exist . furthermore , the name K@@ Diff@@ 3 already indicates that it can merge as the program diff@@ 3 from the Di@@ ff Tool collection . &quot;
I have been using GP@@ L programs for a long time and have learned a lot by looking into the sources of other programs . this is my thanks to all programmers who have gone this path or let him go .
&quot; you compiled the program from the sources and told the configure script probably not the correct pre@@ fix to K@@ DE . in default configure configure in / usr / local , but then K@@ DE will not find the resources for the user interfaces ( e.g. k@@ de@@ 3@@ u@@ i.@@ r@@ c ) . in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file you will find more information on this topic . &quot;
&quot; if only the number of white characters is different , these lines are treated as identical ; however , if only a non @-@ white character is different , the line is treated as not identical . i@@ F similar lines are next to each other , this is usually this mode is often the case . &quot;
&quot; the editor notices for each difference in the files where it starts and where it ends . this is necessary to solve a conflict simply by clicking into the source text and selecting the button A / B / C . however , this important information is lost when the result is simply saved as a text file and it is too much effort to create an extra file format that could store this information . &quot;
you can always restore a certain version by selecting a source A / B / C . to edit larger quantities of text any other editor should be used .
after the removal of text is suddenly fl@@ ushed ; No sr@@ c left ; appeared and the text cannot be deleted . what does that mean and how can this be removed ?
&quot; &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 ; already uses many colors to highlight differences . even more emphasis would be conf@@ using and missing the purpose . for this , please use another editor . &quot;
many good ideas and bug reports came from colleagues and many people from Wild Wild Web . thank you !
&quot; in order to be able to use all the functions of &amp; k@@ diff@@ 3 , you need and k@@ de ; 3.1 or later . &quot;
information on how to use K@@ DE on other platforms without K@@ DE can be found on the homepage .
a list of recent changes can be found under ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ diff@@ 3.@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / Ch@@ ange@@ Log or in the Ch@@ ange@@ Log file in the source package .
&quot; to compile and install , use the following command in the basic folder of the &amp; k@@ de@@ 3 ; -@@ distribution : &quot;
&quot; K@@ DE @-@ dir sets the folder in your system where K@@ DE is installed . if you are unsure , you will find more details in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file . &quot;
&quot; as &amp; k@@ ward 3 ; auto@@ conf and autom@@ ake used , you should have no problems with comp@@ iling . however , if difficulties occur , please report to the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Ma@@ iling lists of them . &quot;
cut ( C@@ trl @-@ X or Shift @-@ Rem@@ ove ) to the clip@@ board and del@@ etes the selected text . insert the text from the clip@@ board at the current cursor position and replace the current selection .
&quot; only show differences : files that are identical in all folders do not appear in the folder structure , and consequently not in the destination folder . &quot;
( in the current program version you have to re @-@ read the folder with the Update function after changes to these options . )
&quot; this also means that identical files will not be copied to the destination folder when merging . if the destination folder does not already contain these files , they are missing after merging . ( the behavior will be disabled in a later program version . ) This option is disabled in default . &quot;
&quot; if you click on one of the buttons , the lines from the corresponding window will be attached to the end of the selected group in the result window ( if they are not already present ) . &quot;
in default this option is disabled . far@@ ew@@ ells in single characters ( such as &apos; A &apos; and &apos; a &apos; ) are treated like differences in white characters .
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; shows a mini preview of all virtual work@@ spaces . it is quite convenient to see the running programs on the work surfaces , change their size , end them or move them . this works both inside a desktop and several . &quot;
the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can display all virtual des@@ kt@@ ops as well as the applications running in it . applications can be selected and even moved on the desktop and to others .
&quot; with the middle mouse button , windows can be moved within a single work area as well as on other work@@ tops . &quot;
&quot; the context menu depends on where the right mouse button is cli@@ cked : when cli@@ cked on the empty background by &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the context menu only has the two entries p@@ ager ... and End . if however on an application within &amp; K@@ p@@ ager , the icon and the name of the application as well as the entries Minim@@ ize , Maxim@@ ize , View on Desktop and End . &quot;
maxim@@ izes the application window to the full size of the desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
sends the application to the selected virtual desktop . only appears when cli@@ cked on an application .
&quot; if this check box is selected , windows within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be moved with the middle mouse button on the desktop and also on other work@@ spaces . &quot;
&quot; when this field is checked , the names of the virtual work@@ spaces are displayed . &quot;
&quot; crosses this field allows the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager to display the numbers of virtual work@@ spaces . if it is enabled together with the name , the names are provided with folder numbers , &amp; eg ; 1 . desktop . &quot;
&quot; when this field is crossed , the background of each desktop is also shown as background in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; &quot;
&quot; if this field is checked , the running programs will be shown as small windows in the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; otherwise only the empty working areas will be displayed to enable their selection . &quot;
here the view of the program window is selected . simple shows simple rec@@ tan@@ gles with the proportions of the program window . icon shows the window with its default symbol and Pix@@ map shows a small view of the actual program window . note : pixel map is only recommended for very fast systems .
&quot; here , the arrangement of the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager can be determined : classic lets and p@@ ager ; appear in a 2x@@ N grid , as from p@@ ager applications in some other window managers ; horizont@@ ally displays all virtual work@@ tops in a horizontal row , which is very good for displaying side@@ ways on the desktop . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; can be used as an alternative to the p@@ ager mini@@ program in the control bar . it has the advantage that it can be changed in size , view and move the windows as symbols or with its contents . furthermore , it runs outside the control bar . &quot;
click the right mouse button within the &amp; K@@ p@@ ager ; and then set sel@@ ector switch to set the dialog box settings .
&quot; at the moment , this can not be changed in the dialog setting . however , you can do this manually : &quot;
&quot; open the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ pag@@ err@@ c with any text editor like e.g. &amp; ke@@ dit ; or vi@@ .@@ If you do not have write permission for the file , you must register as user root or contact your system administrator . &quot;

&quot; this application is interesting for different users : these include artists , web designers and people with visual impair@@ ment . this documentation should be a complete manual for the use of &amp; K@@ mag ; be . &quot;
&amp; K@@ mag ; is a very powerful application that is constantly extended by new functions . it is optimized for use on high @-@ performance computers .
&quot; the main window of &amp; K@@ mag ; shows the enlarged area of the screen . in the following , this window appears as a magni@@ fying window . the image shown in the magni@@ fying window is a magni@@ fied area of the screen and is described below as a selection window . &quot;
&quot; in the default setting , you can magni@@ fy the area around the mouse cursor as a moving magni@@ fier . alternatively , you can set a selected screen area in the magni@@ fying window ( window selection mode ) or the environment of the mouse poin@@ ter at the edge of the screen ( eg ; at the left edge of the screen ) . &quot;
&quot; if you want to avoid the mouse cursor being displayed in the enlarged window , select the mouse cursor setting . please note that the mouse poin@@ ter is still not able to recognize the shape of the mouse poin@@ ter . this is always the default node ; / Q@@ t ; mouse poin@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; in the drop @-@ down window , you can adjust the selection window to your own needs . you can move it with the arrow keys and mouse keys and change its size . this can be done in the following way : &quot;
&quot; move the mouse cursor in the magni@@ fying window and keep the left mouse button pressed , so you can capture and move the contents of the magni@@ fying window . this also goes with the arrow keys . &quot;
&quot; if you additionally press the &amp; Shift , push button or the &amp; M@@ b ; use , you can move the drop @-@ down window . &quot;
&quot; with this combination , you can change the size of the drop @-@ down window . note that the upper left corner of the selection window is fixed and only the lower right corner can be moved . &quot;
&quot; you can send the enlarged image directly to the printer , save it to a file , copy it to the clip@@ board ( to insert it later into other applications ) , rotate the image and much more . &quot;
starts or stops updating the ad . stopping the update causes the CPU time to go against 0 .
&quot; select the update rate ( Very low , Minor , Medium , High , Very High ) . the higher the update rate , the more CPU time is needed . &quot;
&quot; in this mode , a selection window will appear . the selected area will be displayed in a window . &quot;
&quot; &amp; K@@ mag ; automatically uses your set short commands to store files , open a new window , print , new@@ bie ( with the button Document again load in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; ) , En@@ large and Sets &amp; etc ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ mag is also known as &quot; &quot; magni@@ fier ; &quot; &quot; is a screen magni@@ fier . you can use a magni@@ fier , as if you would use a magni@@ fier to view the small print in a newspaper or photo . this application is useful for different people : from research or artist to web designer or visually impaired . &quot;
you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / K@@ mag ( either enter this URL into the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / K@@ mag ) .

&quot; m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is waiting for a while in the same place . it is intended to help people suffering from the R@@ SI syndrome ( Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury syndrome ) and which each mouse click pains . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; emul@@ ates a mouse click , as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter is waiting for a while in the same place . it is intended to help people who suffer pain at the Re@@ peti@@ tive Stra@@ in In@@ jury ( R@@ SI ) Syn@@ drome . &quot;
&quot; if you suffer from pain caused by the use of your computer , you should consult a doctor if this is not yet done . &quot;
&quot; to make it clear once again : even if &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; pain helps prevent pain that is caused by moving the mouse , it is useless against pain caused by moving the mouse . and as with all ergonomic tools , the result can be different for everyone . &quot;
the use of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; is simple : &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; controls your mouse movements and exec@@ utes a mouse click as soon as you stop the movement briefly .
&quot; the smart move activ@@ ates , makes &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; a break after it em@@ ulated the mouse button . now move the mouse , wait until the release of the mouse button is executed . &quot;
this residence time must last after the end of the mouse movement before &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool exec@@ utes a mouse click .
&quot; if Intel@@ lig@@ ently Move is enabled , the shooting time ( 1 / 10 s ) is active . here , the time is set , the &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; after pressing down the mouse button , before releasing the mouse button again , if there is no moving of the mouse in the meantime . &quot;
&quot; a slow moving to the left and back , followed by a pause , a click with the right mouse button . a slow moving to the left and back leads a double click . this moves will be saved in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool _ stro@@ kes@@ .@@ txt , but can be changed later . &quot;
&quot; when the sound is delayed , you can and k@@ de ; move to shor@@ ten reaction time . to do this , go to Sound &amp; Multimedia , select Sound System and General tab . there is a slide control sound buffer which you set to a lower value to shor@@ ten the response times . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , start &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; at each start of &amp; k@@ de ; at the moment , this function is only available under &amp; k@@ de ; for G@@ NO@@ ME or other window environments , please consult the respective documentation to find out how to start a program automatically . &quot;
&quot; reset all settings to the values set when opening the dialog . if you already pressed the user button , the settings are reset to the stand after the last pressing of the user . &quot;
&quot; best use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; first with the pres@@ ets . in particular , the smart move should be switched off at first . if you then get used to the automatic mouse click , you can later increase the smart move . &quot;
&quot; if you use the audi@@ ble click , it might be necessary to reduce the response times of and to sounds . &quot;
&quot; first of all , you should be aware of where a mouse click remains without effect : clicking on the neutral components of windows or in the browser window that does not represent a link does not lead to unwanted reactions . you can therefore park your mouse in such places until you want to use it again . &quot;
&quot; when your mouse bu@@ cks , you should clean your mouse . this is usually quite simple . the trick is that you not only clean the mouse ball , but also the roles that come into contact with the mouse ball . &quot;
&quot; first you need to take the mouse ball out . as this happens , mouse to mouse is different . however , it should be quickly clear when you look at the under@@ side of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the ball , you would have to see the reels . these are located on the sides of the hole in which the ball was inserted . the dirt and the dirt can be scrat@@ ched easily with a flat blade or the f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; in very rare situations , the operating system interrup@@ ts execution of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; if you use the smart move in this case , it means that &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; the operation can no longer be terminated by releasing the mouse button . &quot;
this happens when you use &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; use another window manager and move a window .
&quot; the solution for this problem is that you even run a mouse click . by doing this , the status of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool is reset and you can continue working as usual . &quot;
&quot; problem : if you type text , try &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; continue to execute mouse clicks and put the cursor in another place . &quot;
&quot; solution : use the mouse to place the cursor there where you want it . but parking your mouse on a neutral area of the desktop , if you want to make a keyboard input . &quot;
&quot; I try to work with the intelligent move , but I don &apos;t manage to edit text . &quot;
&quot; the smart move is an advanced function of &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; and it takes time before you can handle it . it is very likely possible to select this way to insert text , insert it into the clip@@ board and move it again or execute any other action when you want to move the mouse with pressed mouse button . &quot;
&quot; do not use the smart move if you just start using it &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; instead , select a mouse click and hold down the Shift key while you move the mouse poin@@ ter to the other end of the text and press the mouse button again . &quot;
&quot; use the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . this time , whenever &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool , the mouse button presses a sound like a mouse click . this allows you to know exactly when the sliding period begins when the smart move starts . later , you can use the intelligent move even without the audi@@ ble click of the mouse . &quot;
&quot; um &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; to be able to use , the X@@ Test extension for &amp; X Window has to be installed . this should be the case on most systems . &quot;
the functionality of the audi@@ ble mouse click is only available when the system has a sound card and speakers and they are set up correctly .
&amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; activ@@ ates the mouse button as soon as the mouse poin@@ ter freezes . this program has been developed for people who suffer from R@@ SI syndrome and which causes pain .
&quot; &amp; k@@ m@@ ous@@ et@@ ool ; can also be configured to wait a certain time for a dra@@ gging process to start before the mouse button is released . in this way , dra@@ gging and dropping using the mouse can also be performed . &quot;

&amp; k@@ mouth ; is a program that lets mu@@ te user speak their computer for themselves .
with the program &amp; k@@ mouth ; silent users can let the computer speak for themselves . the user can choose from a list with the conversation history sentences that are to be discussed again .
on the first page of the wizard ( left screen@@ shot ) enter the command that will be used later for the voice output of text . more details can be found in the description of the setup dialo@@ gs .
&quot; on the second page , select the standard text passages . from the text passages you can often choose used text passages without typing them . the text passages can of course be edited . &quot;
&quot; on the third page ( right screen shot ) you determine the dictionary for the word language . &amp; k@@ mouth ; read the K@@ DE documentation of the chosen language to determine the frequency of each word . additionally , you can balance the word lists with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary , so that only correctly sp@@ elled words can be added to the word supplement . &quot;
the main window of &amp; k@@ mouth ; is clear and contains essentially an input field for the ke@@ yst@@ ro@@ kes of your movements ( the lower white field in the screen@@ shot ) and a course memory of the already spoken sentences ( the upper white field in the screen@@ shot ) .
&quot; if you have squ@@ mouth ; correctly setup , you can enter the sentences you want to hear in the input field . each spoken sentence is attached to the exp@@ ir@@ ation memory . you can select sentences that are to be spoken again . &quot;
&quot; with the menu entry Settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... open the Settings dialog from &amp; k@@ mouth ; this dialog contains two card cards , voice output , and settings , page wor@@ ter@@ fold as well as the page K@@ TT@@ SD language service . &quot;
&quot; in the input field of the card voice output , enter the command to call the voice generator . in the drop @-@ down box below the input field , specify the character encoding , with the text passed on to the voice generator . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; knows two ways to transfer the text . select the check box , if the text should be passed on to the language generator as standard input . &quot;
&quot; if the check box is not selected , the text will be passed as parameter . you can use the following plac@@ eholders : &quot;
&quot; of course , the command to voice output depends on your language generator . you will find this command in the documentation to your language generator . examples for this can be found in the app@@ endi@@ x . &quot;
&quot; with possibility to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a voice service , first try to pass the text to the K@@ TT@@ SD language service . if this is successful , the other settings on this page will be ignored . the kt@@ ts@@ d voice service is a standardized interface for voice output and which is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . the choice of this option is useful even if K@@ TT@@ SD is not installed . &quot;
&quot; with the first selection field action after selecting a text passage , you determine which action is triggered by the short@@ cut or by selecting a text passage in the text@@ book text@@ book or in the bar for text passages . &quot;
&quot; with the selection of So@@ fort@@ über@@ weisung , the chosen passage passage is directly addressed and additionally inserted into the default memory . by selecting from In the input field the chosen passage passage is initially only entered in the input field . &quot;
&quot; with the second drop @-@ down sel@@ ector of the editing window for text passages , you can specify whether the text@@ book should be saved automatically when closing the editing window . &quot;
&quot; by selecting text passages , the book will be saved . if you choose to disc@@ ard any changes , the text@@ book will not be saved . &quot;
&quot; the word translation page contains a list of dic@@ tion@@ aries for word translation . in the main window , next to the input field , &amp; k@@ mouth , a selection box indicates , if this list contains more than one dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons on the right of the page , you can delete or add dic@@ tion@@ aries , change the order of the books or export them to a file . below the list , you can set the language for the dictionary in the input field and select the language for the dictionary . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can compare the word list with an Open@@ Offic@@ e.@@ org dictionary to insert correctly written words into the new dictionary . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you can merge the available dic@@ tion@@ aries . &amp; k@@ mouth ; then ask which dic@@ tion@@ aries are merged , and how they should be wei@@ ghted . &quot;
&quot; with this option , you create a new empty dictionary with no entries . da &amp; k@@ mouth ; newly entered words automatically add into the dictionary , create a dictionary with your vocabulary over time . &quot;
the main area of the window for editing text passages is divided into two . in the upper part the text passages are displayed as tree structure .
&quot; in the lower part you can edit a selected entry . if you have selected a text passage , you can change the text passage or the matching short@@ cut . if you have selected a text passages , you can only change its name . &quot;
&quot; actions such as new text passages or books add or select selected text passages and books can either be accessed through the selection in the menu bar , in the tool@@ bar or via a drop @-@ down menu . &quot;
&quot; the order of text passages or text passages can be changed by dra@@ gging with the mouse to the new location , or using the arrow keys and the &amp; Alt ; button . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is cut out and copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected areas of the disk storage . &quot;
&quot; the selected text is copied to the clip@@ board . if a text section is selected in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected portions of the disk cache . &quot;
&quot; the currently active set is spoken . if there is text in the input field , it will be used , otherwise the selected sentences of the disk storage . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a sliding tool@@ bar with buttons for frequently used commands is displayed . by default , the tool@@ bar is located directly under the menu bar . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is checked , a narrow bar in the bottom part of the main window will be displayed with hints about the state of &amp; k@@ mouth ; if not checked , this status bar is hidden . &quot;
&quot; if this menu entry is ti@@ cked , a sliding bar is displayed for text passages with entries . by default , the bar is placed directly under the tool@@ bar via the editing window . by clicking on the sh@@ aded left side and pulling the tool@@ bar can be moved to another location . &quot;
&quot; you probably did not have the command for the voice output properly or not fully typ@@ ed . open settings k@@ mouth ; set up ... , open the page General Settings and enter the command for voice output on the card voice output . ( see Settings dialog for voice synthes@@ iz@@ ers for further details . ) &quot;
&quot; festival is a language edition system from the University of Edinburgh . currently only English , Spanish and Wal@@ is@@ isch are supported . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting the voice output , it is assumed that festival is installed in the / usr / local / festival folder . the command for voice output is then : &quot;
&quot; Free@@ T@@ TS is a language generator written in Java ; currently , it supports only the English pron@@ unciation . the license allows to use Free@@ T@@ TS free of charge and to spread without restrictions . &quot;
&quot; to show an example of the command line for setting up the voice output , it is assumed that Free@@ T@@ TS is installed in the / usr / local / fre@@ ak@@ .@@ Language output is then possible with one of the following command examples : &quot;
&quot; for the third example , the option must be switched on as default input . ( this is the recommended example of using Free@@ T@@ TS . ) &quot;
&quot; MB@@ RO@@ LA is a language generator for many languages . it converts a list of phon@@ em@@ es into a Wav@@ ed@@ at@@ ei , so you need an additional program to de@@ compose the text in phon@@ em@@ es . the license allows to use MB@@ RO@@ LA for free for non @-@ commercial and non @-@ commercial applications . &quot;
&quot; in our example , Ha@@ di@@ fax is used to convert German text into phon@@ em@@ es for MB@@ RO@@ LA , assuming that Ha@@ di@@ fax and MB@@ RO@@ LA are installed in / usr / local / hadi@@ fax and / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , Ha@@ di@@ fax likes to swallow the last character of the text , so that an additional character has to be added . therefore , the complete command is more elaborate than in the other examples : &quot;
( cat - ; echo quot ; &amp; quot ; ) _ BA@@ R _ / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o -@@ f _ bas@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; art@@ sp@@ lay / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v ; r@@ m / tmp / t@@ mp@@ .@@ wa@@ v
all parts of the command must be written in one line . sending the option data as default input must be enabled .
the voice output da@@ emon by &amp; k@@ de ; ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) is a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ further voice service that provides all &amp; k@@ de ; applications a standard interface for voice output . K@@ TT@@ SD is currently being developed in the SV@@ N . it uses modules to support different voice output systems .
&quot; since the voice generator setting is only done in the K@@ TT@@ SD , you only have to use kt@@ ts@@ d as a language service in &amp; k@@ mouth ; set . &quot;
&quot; to setup , use the K@@ TT@@ SD language service page , which appears in the Settings dialog of &amp; k@@ mouth ; appears when K@@ TT@@ SD is installed . &quot;
&quot; to use it successfully , you need a language generator ( and of course &amp; k@@ de ; 3.@@ x ) . &amp; k@@ mouth ; requires about 15 MB of memory ( and additionally memory for the language generator ) , but that depends on the individual from your computer and its configuration . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an application , with the people who cannot speak , output text by the computer . there is a list of already spoken sentences , which the user can always reis@@ su@@ e . &quot;
note that &amp; k@@ mouth ; no speech synthes@@ izer contains . a speech synthes@@ izer must be installed on the computer .
you can find more detailed user documentation with help : / k@@ mouth ( enter either this URL in the address bar of &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or start k@@ help@@ center help : / k@@ mouth ) .
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; - the voice @-@ over@@ s system by &amp; k@@ de ; - is a module of existing service , which allows every application to read text via the &amp; d@@ bus ; interface . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; is a sub @-@ system in &amp; k@@ de ; for voice output ( T@@ TS ) . it provides a common application interface for &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ programmers are ready , with which their applications can be equipped with T@@ TS skills . &quot;
&quot; reading of texts ( or parts of it ) in text editor &amp; posters ; , even if &amp; posters ; embedded in others &amp; k@@ de ; applications . &quot;
&quot; speech output takes place via speech @-@ schedul@@ er , which uses various background program such as e@@ Spe@@ ak , festival , &amp; etc . &quot;
allows to generate voice output on the command line ( or with shell scripts ) via the &amp; q@@ d@@ bus ; program .
&quot; in Z@@ U@@ K@@ UN@@ FT : support for Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up languages like Vo@@ ic@@ e@@ XML , S@@ able , &amp; Java ; Spe@@ ech Mark@@ up Language ( J@@ S@@ ML ) , and Spe@@ ech @-@ Mark@@ up met@@ a language ( SM@@ ML ) . &quot;
&quot; the voice output service of &amp; k@@ de ; , an application without visible windows that offers T@@ TS services via &amp; d@@ bus ; &quot;
an application with &amp; GUI ; for the configuration and setup of kt@@ ts@@ d about kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the system section .
a module for web browser and kon@@ quer@@ or ; for reading the texts of a website or sharing it .
a module for the text editor ; with which a text file can be read completely or partially .
in addition to the Bug@@ z@@ illa database of &amp; k@@ de ; ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / bu@@ gs@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / ) you will find discussions about &amp; kt@@ ts ; in the list of ht@@ t@@ ps : / / mail@@ .@@ k@@ de@@ .org / mail@@ man / list@@ info / k@@ de@@ .@@ de@@ . the developers can also be found in the I@@ RC ( ir@@ c.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
&quot; before you can use it , you need to install program speech schedul@@ er and set it correctly . see also &quot;
&quot; at the first start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr or as long as there are no actors set up , the card card speaker will be displayed . see also . if you have at least one speaker set up , the card card is General displayed . see . &quot;
&quot; most T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers offer different languages and voices , so also different male or female , or those that differ in volume or speed . you should at least set up a speaker before you &amp; kt@@ ts ; otherwise , the program speed @-@ pat@@ cher otherwise uses the standard speaker . &quot;
various speakers for the same synthes@@ izer are comparable to several printer queu@@ es for the same printer .
&quot; when you click on the card @-@ leading spokes@@ man in kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr , the card file spokes@@ man will be displayed . this will appear automatically when you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and no speaker is set up . &quot;
all speakers already set up appear in this list . the preferred speakers appear on the top of the list . the top speaker is used for voice output when an application does not present a speaker .
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to remove the speaker from the list . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list and click on this button to change the settings . see below . &quot;
&quot; with a mouse click , select a speaker from the list , and click on this button to push the speaker in the list a line further down . the order of the actors in the list determines also their priority . &quot;
click on one of these buttons to apply your changes to the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
&quot; choose a vote type , there are three male and three female voices , as well as a Jun@@ gen@@ - und Girl &apos;s voice . &quot;
&quot; when you click here , the new speaker will appear on the tab or@@ ator . to change the settings of this speaker , click Edit . &quot;
now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; already almost use . go back to the card tab General and check that the T@@ TS service is enabled ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) to allow the T@@ TS service from &amp; k@@ de ; start . see . now you can use &amp; kt@@ ts ; click on the card file to create and manage text orders . see .
&quot; if you have at least one speaker set up , you can start the voice output system from &amp; k@@ de ; click on the General tab to open this card card . here you can set some general options . &quot;
&quot; check this check box to enable the &amp; kt@@ ts ; this starts the K@@ DE @-@ T@@ TS service ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . if this start is successful , the card card is displayed and you can create and read text orders . see . remove the marker , will stop K@@ TT@@ SD and disable the T@@ TS system by &amp; k@@ de ; disabled . &quot;
&quot; if kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr finishes , runs and kt@@ ts ; next , if the field is activated ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is checked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr appears automatically in the Control bar system area , it disappears again as soon as the preview is completed . &quot;
&quot; with buttons in this series , you can start , break , pause , pause and resume text jobs . &quot;
the buttons in this row allow you to read the current text in the &amp; k@@ de ; clip@@ board or open a text file to read . you can also change the speaker for a job .
&quot; click App@@ ly or OK , then all changed settings will be applied on all pages . &quot;
&quot; the card card orders are only displayed when K@@ TT@@ SD is started . to start K@@ TT@@ SD , click the General tab and tick Voice Output ( K@@ TT@@ SD ) . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; , the web browser of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the text of the displayed website . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; run . then select the text you want to read , and select the text you want to read in the main menu . after a short time the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; it is almost always useful to mark the desired text of a website . you can skip this step , but then many &amp; HTML files and other invisible marks are also read . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Plac@@ ement ; the extended text editor of &amp; k@@ de ; , you can read the displayed text . check first if &amp; kt@@ ts ; runs . then check the text that is to be read , and then select the text you want to read in the main menu . then the voice output should start . &quot;
&quot; this also works when &amp; posters ; embedded in other applications , such as &amp; eg ; in &amp; kon@@ quer@@ or ; or in &amp; Qu@@ anta ; . &quot;
&quot; K@@ notification is the news system of &amp; k@@ de , which noti@@ fies you of events specified by you . you can also read the text of these messages by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; in &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; , the I@@ RC program by &amp; k@@ de ; , you can set up different types of messages . for example , you can set up a message when a message appears in an I@@ RC channel in which your nick@@ name occurs . with &amp; kt@@ ts , you can then read the I@@ RC message text . &quot;
&quot; supports a &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ program K@@ Not@@ fy , a menu item displays noti@@ fications in the Settings menu of this program . the possible settings for K@@ notification are different depending on the application . &quot;
&quot; the file k@@ enam@@ .x@@ ml , which is part of the delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , is a good example . it removes the tags b@@ r and b from the messages that K@@ Mail dispat@@ ches , and also the expression / local / in@@ box as it can be assumed in most cases as presum@@ ed . &quot;
filters are one of the advanced capabilities of &amp; kt@@ ts ; for normal work with &amp; kt@@ ts ; filters are not required .
&quot; in filters , text is processed before it is sent to the speech dispens@@ er program . they are useful for improving the pron@@ unciation , to replace the wrong spoken words or abbrevi@@ ations , to select a suitable language and speaker , or to b@@ ypass certain defici@@ encies of speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers and their voices . &quot;
&quot; to understand the functioning of filters , it is important to know how the program &quot; speech @-@ schedul@@ er &quot; works with a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; distinguishes four types of texts . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . if the issue of the screen reader is read , the reserved orders will be continued . &quot;
warnings have the next priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is reserved too hot . warning has priority and keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after issuing the warning .
&quot; messages have the highest priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that uses messages . while you can read a long text on a website , you can talk to &amp; k@@ mouth ; noti@@ fications are also messages . &quot;
&quot; the rest are simple text orders . any order you initiate from the card card is a text order . K@@ Sa@@ y@@ it is an example of applications that use text jobs . text orders are intended for the issue of longer texts , which do not have any special ur@@ gency . &quot;
&quot; all four order forms are processed in queue , except for the output of Screen Re@@ aders . if an application sends the output of a Screen Re@@ aders while &amp; kt@@ ts ; just one such reads , this output is stopped and ended . &quot;
&quot; first , you need to know that filters are never applied to the output of Screen Re@@ aders . they are applied to normal warnings , messages and text orders as well as on &amp; k@@ de ; messages . &quot;
filter works the text and pass it to the next filter . currently there are three types of filters .
filters are executed as modules . in the future there can be further types of filters .
&quot; string replacement parts replace parts of a text by other text . the parts to be replaced can be supplied either as words or as regular expressions . &amp; kt@@ ts ; is supplied with pre@@ defined string replacement filters , which allow to replace chat emoti@@ cons such as : - ) by text or for the format@@ ting of messages from &amp; conversation ; or &amp; k@@ mail ; in a better intel@@ li@@ gible form . &quot;
&quot; &amp; XML ; conver@@ ters use an X@@ SL@@ T file ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) to convert XML ; from one format to another format . in the scope of delivery of &amp; kt@@ ts , some X@@ SL@@ T files are included in the translation of &amp; X@@ HTML ; in SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; with speech selection filters , you can send jobs depending on the content of the text or depending on the program that sent the text to &amp; kt@@ ts ; for example , if you have set a female voice on the card @-@ card speaker , you can read text from K@@ DE messages about it . Si@@ eh@@ . about it . &quot;
&quot; each of these different filters has adjustable rules , according to which it is applied for voice output . if the filter detects that its rules do not apply , it continues the text unchanged to the next filter . &quot;
&quot; when a text order , a message , warning or a &amp; k@@ de notification is sent , it will be processed by all activated filters that were set up on the page below . the processing by the filter takes place in the order in the list from top to bottom . &quot;
&quot; this shows the list of established normal filters . if a filter is not checked , it is not activated and is not used . &quot;
&quot; click here to insert a new filter . select the type of filter , and the following setup dialo@@ gs will be shown below . &quot;
&quot; for setting up string replacement filters , you need to enter a list of words or regular expressions as a comparison pattern . if these patterns are found in the text , the text will be exchanged for the associated replacement text . &quot;
&quot; enter a name for your filter . you can choose this name arbitr@@ arily , it only needs to differ from the names of the other filters . &quot;
this is the list of words and regular expressions . the filter compar@@ es the text with strings in the column matching and replaces it in accordance with the string from the Cre@@ ate column . the list is processed from top to bottom in the order shown above .
click here to post@@ p@@ one the selected word or expression in the list .
&quot; with these buttons , you can load a list of words or regular expressions from a file , save or delete the current list . load a list from a file , the entries from the file are attached to the existing list . &quot;
&quot; if a language is entered here , the filter will only be used if the spokesperson for the text order speaks one of the languages listed here . click the button to view a list of languages . you can also select multiple languages if you press the &amp; C@@ trl key at the mouse click . &quot;
&quot; here is a value entered , the filter is applied only if the text comes from one of the specified applications . you can enter several programs separated by comm@@ a . example : conversation , k@@ mail &quot;
&quot; the application ID of running programs is available with the q@@ d@@ bus program ; the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ numbers must be om@@ itted . if for example , the application ID kop@@ ete @-@ 34@@ 32 , you are allowed to enter only copied . &quot;
&quot; the string replacement filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions are applied with an entry in the Di@@ a filter box if all input fields are empty , the filter will be applied to all texts . &quot;
&quot; when comparing words , the string replacement filter uses regular expressions in the form \ \ s word \ \ s . so the words must be limited on both sides by separ@@ ators ( spaces ) . &quot;
&quot; in this manual you will find no instructions for writing regular expressions . however , if you have installed the &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions can be found in the package k@@ de@@ uti@@ ls . &quot;
XML ; Trans@@ formers translate &amp; XML ; with the help of X@@ SL@@ T files from one format to another format . X@@ SL@@ T ( XML ; Style Language - Trans@@ forms ) is a W3@@ C standard for such transform@@ ations . it can only be applied to well @-@ formed XML . the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c utility must be installed on your system .
&quot; enter the path for the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program . if x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c can be reached via the P@@ AT@@ H environment variable , x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c is also sufficient . &quot;
&quot; with the speaker selection filter , you can send text to a specific speaker , set up on the Cart@@ el Card speaker , or to a speaker with specific features . &quot;
&quot; before &amp; kt@@ ts ; there is a text on the filter , it looks for a speaker for the text . the speaker is selected according to the speaker properties that specify the program , which sends the text to and kt@@ ts ; with the speaker selection filter , you can over@@ write the chosen speaker . &quot;
&quot; if a value is entered here , the filter will be applied if the text contains the entered regular expression . is installed on your system of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Editor &amp; # 160 ; for &amp; # 160 ; regular &amp; # 160 ; expressions installed , you can click it with a click on the button to get help in entering . &quot;
&quot; to achieve faster processing , you should try to anchor the regular expression at the beginning of the string , i.e. , start the regular expression with &lt; ! &#91; C@@ DATA &#91; ^ &#93; &#93; &gt; . &quot;
&quot; here you specify the properties of the speaker you want . if the text meets the filter conditions shown above , the speaker will be chosen that matches the desired requirements . click the button on the right to display the dialog box selection . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to save or load your voice settings , or to delete all settings . &quot;
the filter selection filter will only be applied to the text if all conditions are applied with an entry in the Di@@ a filter box if applicable . you must enter at least one condition .
&quot; the voice @-@ over@@ s API , by &amp; k@@ de ; with which programmers can lend their applications T@@ TS skills . applications communicate with K@@ TT@@ SD about &amp; d@@ bus ; . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ TT@@ SD module API , which can be added to K@@ TT@@ SD with the speech synthes@@ izer , so that it can use this synthes@@ izer . &quot;
the following section contains a brief description of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ D@@ Bus interface ; the complete documentation for both AP@@ Is can be found at the k@@ de ; Acces@@ sibility website ( ht@@ t@@ p : / / acces@@ si@@ bil@@ ity.@@ k@@ de@@ .org ) .
applications require voice output services via the &amp; d@@ bus ; -@@ Interface from &amp; k@@ de ; from the kt@@ ts@@ d program to the object K@@ Spe@@ ech .
&quot; text of the text for reading and option is a language code like &amp; eg ; en , de &amp; etc . &quot;
there are more commands you can use . for a list of all commands you can use
&quot; open two and console ; -@@ window . just start kt@@ ts@@ d in a window , then kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr in the other . &quot;
none of the mentioned language synthes@@ iz@@ ers supports my language . where can I get a synthes@@ izer for my language ?
&quot; I have set up the HTML ; -@@ XML ; -@@ conversion filter , but when using the module for festival websites , websites are not read . &quot;
&quot; due to an error in Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , you must install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone so that S@@ able does not work at all . so , you must do that even if you do not use this voice to read websites . &quot;
&quot; certain characters or pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks seem to cause mistakes in the synthes@@ izer , so that whole sentences are ski@@ pped or only ch@@ ewing g@@ ossi@@ p is spent . what can I do against it ? &quot;
&quot; first of all , make sure the encoding option is set to the correct value for the corresponding language . if there are problems with certain characters or words , they may be corrected by a string replacement filter . see . &quot;

&quot; the language synthes@@ iz@@ ers used by &amp; kt@@ ts have their own license , which you can find in the related documentation or on the websites concerned . there are also voices that have their own license . &quot;
&quot; if you have access to the K@@ DE source code archive , you can download and extract the package from it . you can also download the source code from k@@ de@@ f ft@@ p : / / ft@@ p.@@ k@@ de@@ .org / pub / k@@ de / . &quot;
&quot; contains many languages , a list of all currently supported languages can be found on the project page ht@@ t@@ p : / / es@@ pe@@ ak@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net / langu@@ ag@@ es.@@ html . &quot;
&quot; English , British , Spanish , German , Finnish , Czech , Polish , Russian , Italian , French , Canadian French , Kis@@ w@@ ah@@ ili , Zul@@ u and Ibiza . &quot;
K@@ T@@ TS works with any speech synthes@@ izer which can be started on the command line in a &amp; console .
&quot; the list of the above languages can be incomplete or outdated . therefore , consult the description of the synthes@@ izer to the supported languages . check also on the website of kt@@ ts ; , for information that is not yet included in this manual . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; speech @-@ schedul@@ er &quot; program uses adaptive module architecture for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers . if you wish to extend the use of a synthes@@ izer , please contact the developer team . &quot;
&quot; the x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c program is used for the support of SS@@ ML and for the XML transformation filter , but is not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c using apt @-@ get install x@@ sl@@ t@@ pro@@ c . &quot;
&quot; to compile , you need a current development environment of K@@ DE ( version 3.4 or newer ) , including packages k@@ deli@@ bs and the development files for the program &quot; &quot; speech @-@ schedul@@ er . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded the source code from &amp; kt@@ ts ; from the source code archive for dic@@ tion@@ aries or downloaded tar@@ ball each night , compile and install the program using the following commands : &quot;
&quot; before you use it , check first if speech @-@ schedul@@ er works correctly with your speech synthes@@ izer . to do this , you can use the shell script SPD @-@ conf . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; in &amp; k@@ de ; 4.4 is the first version of &amp; kt@@ ts , which uses the program speech @-@ schedul@@ er . the program kt@@ t@@ ms@@ g should be developed in such a way that the setup of speech @-@ schedul@@ er is possible and the script SPD @-@ conf is no longer needed . &quot;
&quot; a long text is de@@ composed into individual sentences . the user can go back , repeat , pause , or cancel the output . &quot;
&quot; if an application passes text to &amp; kt@@ ts , it can specify the properties of the preferred speaker for the output . if you have set up a speaker whose language is English and whose sex is female , this will be used , otherwise it will automatically select the best matching speaker . if you want to learn more about how &amp; t@@ ts ; a speaker is selected , you will see in . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the following the setup of the module for festival Inter@@ active will be shown below . details on the modules can be found below . &quot;
&quot; enter the path to the exec@@ utable festival program . if the path to festival in P@@ AT@@ H is included , you only have to enter festival . &quot;
&quot; select the character encoding for text passed to festival . for voices known as Czech or Slovak , this setting is made automatically . in general , Western languages such as Czech or Slovak use ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; these slide controls allow you to adjust volume , speech speed , and pitch of the synthetic language . if you cannot select some regulator and display this gray , the voice you have chosen does not allow you to adjust the settings . &quot;
&quot; some voices like Multi@@ Sy@@ n voices require several seconds to be loaded because of their size . if you mark this check box , these voices are already loaded at the start of K@@ TT@@ SD so that the first set is synthes@@ ized faster ( with larger memory usage ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box cannot be selected , you have not yet set up a speaker ( or click App@@ ly to apply ) . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is selected , the kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is displayed at the start of kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr . otherwise , after the start , only the symbol kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is visible in the system section , but not the program window . click on the icon in the system section to display the program window . &quot;
&quot; if this check box is marked and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr does not run yet , it appears in the system area as soon as K@@ TT@@ SD reads a text . this allows you to stop reading or otherwise control the reading . &quot;
&quot; here all orders are listed in the queue , along with the application that has set the job , the current status of the order , the number of sentences and the straight processed sentence . &quot;
&quot; with the buttons in this row , you can proceed in a set @-@ by @-@ way in the order selected in the list below , forward or backward . ( but not every order consists of several sets ) . &quot;
&quot; with one click on OK , all changes in the settings ( also on the other card cards ) are taken over and kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr is reduced to the symbol in the system section . then click on this icon to show the program window . &quot;
&quot; if the sound system &amp; arts ; not installed , but instead AL@@ SA , G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de , click on the card audio . see also . &quot;
&quot; here , only text orders are listed and managed . issues of screen readers , warnings and messages are not displayed . read more about the message types of &amp; kt@@ ts ; find in . &quot;
&quot; select the type of audio output here . if a component cannot be selected , &amp; kt@@ ts ; either compiled without support for the appropriate audio module or d@@ kt@@ ts ; can not load the required libraries . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use G@@ Stre@@ amer or a@@ Co@@ de for the audio output , select the audio output here . if no output modules are displayed in the list , you must install at least one module . if you have selected AL@@ SA , select the PC@@ M device here . see also &quot;
set the talk speed here . 50@@ nbsp ; % equ@@ als about half and 200@@ nbsp ; % about the double normal talk speed . to enable these settings to be implemented the program must be so@@ x installed .
click App@@ ly to take over the new settings for the current &amp; kt@@ ts ; system .
the list of AL@@ SA devices includes all PC@@ M devices and modules installed in your system . most of them will not work . you have to find out which device works with you . in doubt choose Standard .
&quot; on this card you can set up special actions , which are always executed when the text order is interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; the output of screen readers has the highest priority . it is preferred to all other orders and keeps these orders . after the issue of the screen reader has been read , the reserved orders are resum@@ ed . &quot;
warnings have the highest priority . this level is important news such as &amp; eg ; processor is subject to hot . a warning keeps the output of messages and normal text . these orders are continued after reading the warning .
&quot; messages have the next priority . a message interrup@@ ts normal text . &amp; k@@ mouth ; is an example of an application that speaks news . if you have just read a long text on a website , you can still welcome someone who is entering the room . &quot;
&quot; a text order is interrupted by a message , warning or issue of a Screen Re@@ aders , inserts &amp; kt@@ ts ; the audio output in the queue . &quot;
&quot; this audio file is always played when a normal text job is interrupted . if both sound and introductory messages are active , the introductory sound is played before the introductory message . &quot;
&quot; the settings on this card are only valid for normal text orders . for messages , warnings and the spending of screen readers , there are no special promotions if they are interrupted by a message with higher priority . &quot;
&quot; to read with &amp; kt@@ ts ; to read the notification messages , launch kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr and click noti@@ fications . the card file al@@ erts appears . &quot;

&quot; if this setting is selected , noti@@ fications where a sound is played is not read by &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; use these buttons to add or delete events to the list . if you click the Add button , a dialog appears where you can select the application and the event you want to add to the list . &quot;
&quot; this event reads the message before , the &amp; Con@@ vers@@ ation ; will be sent when someone in an I@@ RC message men@@ tions your nick@@ name . &quot;
all events for which nothing else is specified in the list are ignored by &amp; kt@@ ts ; ignored .

&quot; you can enter here the properties of the desired speaker . standard chooses the speaker , which is displayed as the top entry in the list on the card card speaker . &quot;
&quot; note that there are three levels for events . if an action is specified for a specific event of a specific application , it is executed . otherwise , the action will be executed for all other events of the particular application . &quot;

&quot; the Spe@@ ech Syn@@ thesis Mark@@ up Language ( SS@@ ML ) is a W3@@ C standard to highlight text for voice output . this standard includes trademarks for controlling voice , voice , volume , sex of voice and pitch . &quot;
currently supported and kt@@ ts ; SS@@ ML only partially and only in basic functions . the following limitations are available :
&quot; you must install the ra@@ b _ di@@ phone voice ( British man@@ ly ) , as this is the default voice , the festival is used in the output of SS@@ ML . &quot;
&quot; if settings for speed or pitch in the festival configuration dialog are not set to 100@@ k ; % , SS@@ ML is usually spoken very mon@@ oton@@ ous . &quot;

&quot; there are two types of filters - normal filters and pun@@ ctu@@ ation detection filters ( SD@@ B filters ) . S@@ B@@ Ds sub@@ divide text into individual sets . this allows you to start or stop orders faster with pre @-@ reading since only the first set has to be synthes@@ ized , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this directly . &quot;
&quot; at the first start of &amp; kt@@ ts , a set @-@ level detection filter is set up automatically . you can change its settings or add further set limits filter , but beginners will get away from it . &quot;
&quot; the easiest way to learn how to set up the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection . switch on the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection and enter text for preview . check the Spe@@ aker Sel@@ ection , change the Spe@@ aker &apos;s selection , change some properties and check how the selection of the speaker is changed . &quot;
&quot; &amp; kt@@ ts ; then you can start reading faster , because only the first set has to be processed and not the whole text block , which can take a very long time , &quot;
&quot; you can pause or break text orders on the card card , even if the speech synthes@@ izer does not support this function . &quot;
&quot; for these reasons , the normal set limit detection filter is automatically set up if you start kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr for the first time . it cannot be switched off , only removed . do not change anything at this filter unless you know what you are doing . &quot;
pun@@ ctu@@ ation filters compare text with a regular expression for pun@@ ctu@@ ation and add a tab@@ ulation mark ( dec@@ im@@ al code 8 ) to the set limits ( tab characters are automatically removed from the text before filtering ) .
&quot; S@@ BD filters are never applied to &amp; k@@ de ; messages ( k@@ not ) , warnings , messages or the output of screen re@@ a@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; if you have removed the normal set limit filter from obsc@@ urity , you can insert it again by loading the standard _ s@@ b@@ dr@@ c file contained in &amp; kt@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the list of speakers , you can over@@ write the language settings for the application . &quot;
use of the standard speaker ( the top on the card or@@ ator ) . in other words : no speaker properties are specified .
&quot; use of the most suitable spokes@@ man , who has all the characteristics of an appointed spokes@@ man . if you do not delete or edit the settings of the speaker , select &amp; des@@ kt@@ ts ; otherwise select &amp; kt@@ ts ; the speaker who most likely corresponds to the originally set properties . &quot;
select the method to enter the desired speaker properties by clicking on one of the selection buttons .
&quot; select here the properties of the desired speaker . if this feature does not play a role , do not give anything . &quot;
mark this check box if the property should take preced@@ ence over other properties . you can also set several markers here .
&quot; since the language is a critical factor when editing the output , it is always treated as a priority feature . you will rarely use this feature . the only case you may want to specify the attribute language is available if you know that a particular application sends text in a different language than the one in the working environment . &quot;
&quot; to use all the properties in the Spe@@ aker range , which is most likely to delete the following , click on the default speaker and then use the speaker that best matches the following . &quot;
in this case 0 is for the last word order in the queue . you can also specify a order number . ( without the order number the input 0 is required ) .
&quot; kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr immediately crashes when it is started . I have compiled Deb@@ u@@ g support , but I do not get trac@@ e@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x has been killed . probably you have to register G@@ Stre@@ amer . at G@@ Stre@@ amer 0.@@ 8.@@ x , you have to install G@@ Stre@@ amer . if the problem is not resolved , G@@ Stre@@ amer is possibly a non @-@ compatible version of G@@ Stre@@ amer . you can try to update or uninstall G@@ Stre@@ amer . &quot;
&quot; the audio output via AL@@ SA does not work if I play music simultaneously with another application . if I receive a text order , freezes &amp; kt@@ ts ; one . on the &amp; Con@@ sole ; appears a message saying : Un@@ able to open PC@@ M . &quot;
&quot; in your system , the problem is that conflicts with AL@@ SA are occurring that prevent the simultaneous opening of several PC@@ M devices . please refer to the website of the AL@@ SA project ( d@@ mix ) at www.@@ al@@ sa @-@ proj@@ ect@@ .org . &quot;
&quot; I downloaded an additional voice for festival from the Internet . I installed it and can use it in festival , but kt@@ ts@@ m@@ gr doesn &apos;t show this voice . &quot;
&quot; in the file $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / apps / kt@@ ts@@ d / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ int / voices the new voice will be added . as a guide , you can serve the other entries . if that &apos;s successful , please send a patch along with the &amp; URL ; on which you have found the voice , to the developers . &quot;
&quot; on the audio card audio there is a setting speed . in order for this to work , the program must be installed so@@ x and be discover@@ able via the environment variable P@@ AT@@ H . some syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer modules such as Festival Inter@@ active offer a setting for speed even on the card for speakers . depending on the selected voice , this is active or in@@ active . &quot;
&quot; the settings for the voice speed are ignored when &amp; kt@@ ts ; &amp; HTML ; read . ( this is because the HTML is converted to SS@@ ML . ) de@@ activate either the filter for converting &amp; HTML ; after &amp; XML ; ( see ) or , if you are quite brave , change the .x@@ s@@ l file of the &amp; HTML ; -@@ after @-@ SS@@ ML forming filter , and set the voice speed up . &quot;
&quot; I do not create websites with a female voice . I have set up a female festival speaker , but &amp; kt@@ ts ; read the web pages with a male voice . &quot;
&quot; at Festival 1.@@ 95 beta , the day S@@ able GEN@@ DER does not seem to work . so that festival does not produce errors , the x@@ s@@ l file re@@ jects the GEN@@ DER tags . the same applies to VO@@ ICE tags . &quot;
&quot; I have added a separate label attachment filter and now I can go back or forth ; no more set @-@ up or return . on the card @-@ runner , orders are displayed , the job consists only of one set . what am I doing wrong ? &quot;
&quot; pun@@ ctu@@ ation marks ( dot , question mark , ex@@ clamation mark , comm@@ a and sem@@ ic@@ ol@@ on ) are not allowed to filter out . instead , use a filter for pro@@ posi@@ tional detection instead . &quot;

&quot; some users experience in connection with AL@@ SA conflicts with the audio output . if your system also counts , you can &apos;t simultaneously play music and read a text . &amp; kt@@ ts ; also freezes when you stop a text order and then start another . possible solutions for this problem can be found on the website of AL@@ SA ( d@@ mix ) . &quot;
&quot; as of July 2005 , a@@ Ko@@ de doesn &apos;t support any real breaks . if you stop a word order in &amp; kt@@ ts , the current sentence is still read . &quot;
&quot; the audio program so@@ x is used for the general adjustment of the voice speed , but is otherwise not mandatory . Deb@@ ian users can then install so@@ x using apt @-@ get install so@@ x . the program is already included on most &amp; Linux ; CDs already included . &quot;
&quot; if you have downloaded tar@@ ball ( tar @-@ packed archive ) , login as a normal user and un@@ zip the tar@@ ball into a suitable folder . change to this folder and enter the following commands : &quot;

&quot; the following modules for speech synthes@@ iz@@ ers are created by default , some of them own a run@@ time dependency of non @-@ free software . ( non @-@ free according to the Deb@@ ian distribution directives ) . &quot;
&quot; as default , &amp; kt@@ ts ; in / opt / K@@ DE@@ 3 installed . if this folder is not listed in the environment variable $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ RS , you must specify the --@@ pre@@ fix = destination option . &quot;

CD dec@@ lines echo frac@@ ts@@ d &gt; in@@ st @-@ apps make -@@ f Mak@@ ef@@ il@@ e.@@ c@@ vs . / configure cd kt@@ ts@@ d make su make install
&quot; before you use it , check first if your speech synthes@@ izer works correctly . follow the instructions that you have received with the synthes@@ izer . &quot;
&quot; festival is one of the best free T@@ TS synthes@@ iz@@ ers , whose source code is open . the quality of the voices is generally good , and there are multiple voices and languages supported . &quot;
&quot; you must install at least one language . help can be found in the instructions provided with festival . if you want to read web pages , you need to install the ( male British ) voice ra@@ b _ di@@ phone . &quot;
&quot; for these voices you need to compile an additional module , so you need the source code of the festival . the German voices are subject to restrictions when passing on . &quot;
&quot; the voice is still in an early stage of development . un@@ pack the software in festival / li@@ b / bin / r@@ ussi@@ an / . if you set up the Russian voices , you need to enter the voice MS@@ U _ ru _ NS@@ H _ di@@ phone . select a Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic ( 8 bit ) encoding as for example ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; festival is normally included in the distri@@ butions , so look for festival first on the CDs of your distribution . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Polish , Hungarian or Czech languages , the encoding option must be set to ISO 88@@ 59 @-@ 2 . &quot;
&quot; if you want to use the Russian voice , the encoding option must be set to a 8 @-@ bit Cy@@ ri@@ l@@ lic , such as ko@@ i@@ 8 @-@ R . &quot;
&quot; festival can be used together with the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ Synthes@@ izer . then , Festival takes over the le@@ xi@@ cal analysis and &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; this creates the audio output . the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ program and the MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices can be downloaded from &quot;
note that &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; no complete voice output system is . &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; generated language from di@@ ph@@ onic files . you need additional software to create this di@@ phone . festival produces this by &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; required di@@ phon@@ e.@@ t@@ x@@ t@@ 2@@ ph@@ o can also produce from German texts Di@@ phones . more information can be found under .
&quot; in this case , additional wra@@ pper code is added to festival to use &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voices for voice synthesis . note that the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; -@@ voice files will not be installed in the &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; folder , but in the folder festival / li@@ b / . &quot;
&quot; I@@ MS German Festival is a modified version of festival for German &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA . it is required either festival version 1.@@ 4.1 or festival 2.0 ( 1.@@ 95@@ beta ) . first , install festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; then download the MS German Festival from &quot;
&quot; instructions can be found in the RE@@ AD@@ ME file in the package you downloaded . ( for use with Festival 2.0 , the introduction of error correc@@ tions is not required , you only need to re@@ compile the festival ) . then add the following lines to the file festival / li@@ b / sit@@ ein@@ it@@ .@@ sc@@ m . &quot;
&quot; the voice location &quot; &quot; German _ de@@ 1 _ os &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 1 &quot; &quot; / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; German Fem@@ ale , I@@ MS Festival de@@ 3 &quot; &quot; ) &quot;
&quot; on some systems you need to edit the file / etc / fes@@ tiv@@ al@@ .@@ sc@@ m . just add the lines for your installed German voices . replace the correct path in / usr / local / MB@@ RO@@ LA / . at the time of creating this manual , the German de@@ 4 , de@@ 5 , or de@@ 6 voices do not work with I@@ MS German Festival . &quot;
this method uses special code to issue the language about festival with a Czech &amp; MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and install and install first Festival and MB@@ RO@@ LA ; and make sure both work . then download festival Czech of

the command module allows you to use &amp; kt@@ ts ; any language synthes@@ izer can be controlled on the command line .
&quot; best use a command that writes the voice output to a temporary audio file ( wa@@ v ) , instead of sending the output directly to the audio device &quot;
&quot; this manual explains the installation and use of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; , a module for the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center , which allows managing network interfaces , routing and DNS settings . &quot;
&quot; the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; allows the user to manage a number of system and desktop settings via a uniform , integrated interface . the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called by selecting K Menu k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; can be called .. &quot;
the &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; package was designed to allow users to manage the TCP / IP network settings in the same way as other settings from the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; create a simple interface for the user for the following tasks :
&quot; after installation , a new module network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center will be displayed . the Network Set@@ ting module ( k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; ) can be started by selecting a k@@ contro@@ l@@ center ; Internet &amp; Networking Network settings in the &amp; K@@ Menu ; . &quot;
&quot; it is important to understand that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; network hardware cannot be installed . physical devices and their drivers must already be installed and configured , so that &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; the device at all displays and allows setting of network characteristics . &quot;
&quot; in most cases , drivers for network hardware and other devices are installed and configured to install and install Linux . if network devices are added later , the drivers need to be loaded by adaptation of the following files , according to the kernel version : &quot;
&quot; the Network Set@@ ting module is loaded when the option &quot; &quot; Network settings in the &amp; k@@ contro@@ l@@ center &quot; &quot; index is selected . &quot;
&quot; if the platform cannot be detected , the hand selection is offered . it is the platform from the list to choose which is best suited for distribution and rel@@ e@@ as@@ est@@ and . &quot;
&quot; changing the network settings is only possible in system management mode . before , all options are displayed gray , which means the settings can only be considered , changing the settings is not possible . in system management mode , you can enter the system administrator mode at the right bottom of the module . &quot;
&quot; in system management mode , the entire functionality of the module is available . it is divided into three tab@@ s : &quot;
the tab Network interfaces are used to manage the network devices of the system . all available network devices are displayed . the following tasks can be performed by the tab Network interfaces :
the settings indicated by the network can be set up by selecting the desired device in the list and clicking the button interface ... set up in the dialog device .
&quot; by default , only basic TCP / IP settings are available . click the Advanced Settings button to display the dialog with advanced options . &quot;
&quot; with the automatic selection , TCP / IP settings are fet@@ ched from a D@@ H@@ CP server or BO@@ O@@ TP server . in automatic mode , the TCP / IP settings for the system are carried out simultaneously with the start of the system services . the D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP server sends all necessary TCP / IP settings for each system start , so there is no further adjustment required . in the selection list , either D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP can be selected according to the system . &quot;
&quot; with the choice Manual , the TCP / IP configuration can be done without D@@ H@@ CP or BO@@ O@@ TP . in the IP address input field , the desired TCP / IP address must be specified . &quot;
&quot; if this setting is selected , the system initi@@ alizes the network interface during boot . if the initi@@ alization is not desired , this option should not be activated . &quot;
the values entered in this dialog are shown as properties of the device in the device list .
it should be ensured that the IP address in the network is not already used . entering an already existing IP address would lead to a TCP / IP conflict . ping in the &amp; Con@@ sole allows you to determine if the desired address is already in use . in doubt the network administrator should be asked .
network devices can be activated or disabled as needed . switch on a disabled network device by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
network devices can be activated or disabled as needed . turn off an activated network device by selecting from the list and clicking on interface ....
&quot; speci@@ fies the host &apos;s IP address in the local sub@@ net , which con@@ veys the physical connection to remote networks and is used by default to TCP / IP communication with hosts in other sub@@ nets . &quot;
&quot; if there is more than one network interface on the computer , the interface must be selected to the network where the gateway computer is located . &quot;
&quot; a machine with DNS support replaces a complete domain assignment by the corresponding IP address . this is necessary because computers can only understand IP addresses . if the host requests ht@@ t@@ p : / / www.@@ ein@@ ed@@ om@@ ain@@ .org , DNS dis@@ sol@@ ves this name into an IP address such as 12@@ 3.@@ 4@@ 5.@@ 67@@ 8.@@ 90 . &quot;
&quot; the host name resolution machine part of the Rei@@ ters name resolution allows easy management of this list . entries can be added , removed or changed . &quot;
&quot; by clicking the button Add ... from the machine to the name resolution , a DNS server can be added . it will display the New Name Server dialog . &quot;
&quot; first , enter the IP address of the DNS server and then click the Add button . the entry will then be added to the list . &quot;
&quot; from the machine to the name resolution , select an entry and then click the Edit button .... &quot;
&quot; the list named known calcul@@ ator describes the machine name @-@ to @-@ IP address references for the TCP / IP sub@@ system . it is primarily used when bo@@ oting when no DNS server is available . in small , closed networks , it can replace DNS servers . &quot;
&quot; normally the list contains some known hosts some entries that support &amp; ap@@ os ; loc@@ al@@ host@@ ap@@ os , and some special IP@@ v@@ 6 addresses . &quot;
enter the IP address of the known computer and click Add ... Add the New Ali@@ as dialog .
&quot; enter the name of the known computer and click the Add button . if the known computer has multiple alias names , press the Add button several times and enter the other alias names . &quot;
select an entry of a particular known computer from the list and select Edit ... the Edit dialog will display .
&quot; one of the following tasks can be executed , then clicking OK will update the list of static hosts . &quot;
&quot; settings made in the Network Set@@ ting module are not immediately effective in the system . to activate the changes , the following command must be removed . &quot;
the homepage of &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; is ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ net@@ work@@ s@@ conf@@ .@@ sour@@ ce@@ for@@ ge@@ .net from which you can download the latest version of the source code .
&quot; for the installation of binary distri@@ butions ( usually rpm packages ) , it is enough if &amp; k@@ de ; and Q@@ t are installed . &quot;
the installation of the pre @-@ compiled version is recommended for less experienced users . it is easy to download the rpm package and install in a / console ; with rpm as follows :
&quot; alternatively , a tool with graphical interface like k@@ package or the installation tool of your distribution can be used . &quot;
&quot; for this case , the installation of Q@@ t and &amp; k@@ de is sufficient ; not , but in addition , the development packages with libraries and other things are needed . &quot;
&quot; this is only recommended to experienced users , but it is not difficult to compile and compile . the following commands should do so . &quot;
&quot; in the first section of this chapter , important information is given about basic network technology , and in the second all of the configuration files will be discussed . &quot;
&quot; in this app@@ endi@@ x , only basic information about the integration of the PC into a small ( home ) network is medi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; currently , IP networks are operated with TCP / IP version 4 ( IP@@ v@@ 4 ) . IP@@ v@@ 5 has never found great dis@@ semination . IP@@ v@@ 6 is expected to continue in the near future . &quot;
&quot; one of the most important information is the knowledge of the IP address of a network interface . in foreign networks , at the &amp; eg ; workplace , the network administrator is the contact point that applies a valid IP address or , if available , D@@ H@@ CP can be used . in any case , the IP address cannot be chosen arbitr@@ arily ! &quot;
&quot; when setting up your own small ( home ) network , the IP address should be selected from a dedicated area dedicated specifically for this purpose in order to avoid IP address conflicts with the global ( Internet ) network . the addresses from the table below are not forwarded on the Internet , therefore any use is possible . &quot;
&quot; of course , access to the Internet can be enabled for such machines by setting up a g@@ ate@@ ways . &quot;
&quot; for smaller networks , addresses in the range from 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.1 to 19@@ 2.@@ 16@@ 8.@@ 1.@@ 25@@ 4 are used . the range is large enough for networks up to 250 computers . &quot;
&quot; additionally , the net@@ mask is usually set to 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.@@ 25@@ 5.0 , so that all hosts are in the same sub@@ net . &quot;
&quot; some addresses are reserved for special things , 0.0@@ 1@@ eg ; .@@ 0.0 and 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 . the first is the so @-@ called standard route , the second is the lo@@ op@@ back address ( loc@@ al@@ host = the own host ) . the default route is required for the IP forwarding . &quot;
&quot; the address 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 is reserved for the IP traffic in the local machine . normally , the address is assigned to 12@@ 7.@@ 0.@@ 0.1 of its own so @-@ called lo@@ op@@ back interface , which works like a closed circle . &quot;
this section contains the configuration files that are affected by &amp; k@@ net@@ work@@ conf ; and where they are stored in the various distri@@ butions .
&quot; this file is sometimes dynamically changed for DSL connections , so it is not surprising if there is another content than specified there in the case of active DSL connections . &quot;
for &amp; Su@@ SE ; it is known that this file is random@@ ly sorted by the scripts in Su@@ S@@ Econ@@ fig . another stand than expected can therefore occur .

&amp; k@@ ron@@ on ; is an application that lets you run other programs in the background after a timetable . it is a graphical interface for the &amp; UNIX ; system program cr@@ on .
&quot; when you start &amp; cr@@ on ; see a list of already configured tasks and associated environment variables . if you use &amp; cr@@ on ; as root , this will appear for all users of the system as well as for system @-@ internal tasks . each folder can be opened and accessed . &quot;
&quot; for a disabled task , the program name and parameter are not displayed and the description appears de@@ activated . &quot;
&quot; the environment variables present here reset the otherwise existing environment variables for all tasks listed above , except for force . &quot;
&quot; to create a new task , first select the task folder . then go to the Edit New ... Altern@@ atively , you can click the task folder with the right mouse button and click the New ... menu in the pop @-@ up context menu and press C@@ trl ; N . &quot;

&quot; it appears the standard k@@ de ; -@@ print dialog . if you select fl@@ aps , you will see that there are two additional &amp; k@@ ron@@ on ; -@@ specific options in the print dialog . &quot;
prints the c@@ ron@@ tab of all users on the system . this option is only accessible to users who have advanced authori@@ z@@ ations .
&quot; cr@@ on , for example , Vi@@ x@@ ie @-@ cr@@ on . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses the c@@ ron@@ tab command to change the schedules of the users . &quot;
&quot; a PO@@ SIX con@@ form@@ es &amp; UNIX ; , for example with gli@@ b@@ c . &amp; k@@ cr@@ on ; uses standard commands from &amp; UNIX ; to experience time and date . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; is a backup program for tape drives on the basis of tar . it offers the possibility to store several archives on a tape . the first was to create a surface for tar , which provided the ability of dd@@ s@@ 2@@ tar for fast , selective un@@ packing . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be bound by &amp; k@@ dat ; this can be done in three ways : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; how@@ l the tape back and read the pre @-@ tension@@ ing information of the tape . do not recognize the tape ; if the tape does not work on the tape , you will be asked if the tape is to be format@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; detects and dat ; the default , it searches for the right index on your disk . if it cannot be found , you will be asked if the tape index should be recre@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; when everything went smoothly , the symbol for the tape drive changes to indicate that the tape was integrated . in the status bar , a corresponding message appears . the contents of the tape can now be searched by un@@ folding the entry for the tape . &quot;
&quot; before ej@@ ecting the tape , the integration must first be solved . there are three methods to accomplish this : &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ dat ; by changing the symbol for the tape to recognize that the integration for the tape is solved , and shows a corresponding message in the Status bar . the tape can now be ej@@ ected without danger . &quot;
&quot; before a tape can be used , it must be format@@ ted by &amp; k@@ dat ; &quot;
&quot; a band type must be format@@ ted before you can be used to store data . this process does not correspond to format@@ ting at &amp; k@@ dat ; if your tape drive requires that a tape can be format@@ ted before being used , this must happen before you are format@@ ted by the tape . flo@@ ppy drives do not normally require a format@@ ting of tape , but DA@@ T drives do not . &quot;
&quot; after entering the band name and capacity , continue with the format@@ ting of the tape . all data on the tape will be lost ! after completion of the format@@ ting process , the tape is automatically integrated and ready to use . &quot;
&quot; before you start the backup process , you need to select the files to be secured . this can be done in three ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in the local file tree . it will only backup this file or folder .
mark a backup profile in the tree . only the files specified in the profile are saved .
select files in the local file tree with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be backed up .
right @-@ click on the local file tree and select Save in the Save ...
&quot; once the backup has been opened , the dialog opens for backup . in this dialog you can again check the selected files and change the settings for the backup . &quot;
&quot; when you confirm the settings , the dialog box appears . the dialog displays the progress of the backup process , including the data rate and the remaining time . &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives in the entry for the drive . it will only check the selected file or folder .
select the files in one of the archives in the entry for the tape with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders are checked .
right @-@ click in one of the archives and select the menu entry Test ....
&quot; once the test procedure has been started , the dialog appears for checking . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for the review . &quot;
&quot; when you have confirmed the settings for the review , the dialog appears to check . this dialog displays the progress of the examination process as well as the data throughput and time remaining . &quot;
&quot; before you can re@@ connect , the files that are to be restored must be selected . this can be done in two ways : &quot;
select a file or folder in one of the archives that belong to the tape drive entry . it will only restore the selected file or sub@@ folder .
select the files you want from one of the archives with a tick . only the selected files and / or sub@@ folders will be recovered .
right @-@ click on a file or folder in one of the archives and select Rest@@ ore in the menu ....
&quot; once the restore process has been started , the dialog appears for recovery . in this dialog you can once again check your selection and change the working folder for recovery . &quot;
&quot; if you have confirmed the recovery settings , the dialog will appear again . this dialog displays the progress of the recovery process as well as the data throughput and time remaining . &quot;
sometimes it turns out to be necessary to recre@@ ate the band index file using the band &apos;s content . this process del@@ etes all existing index files for this band . you can recre@@ ate the index in two ways from the band :
this creates a backup profile with the selected files and the default settings . you can make the following settings for a backup profile :
the current work folder in which the backup should take place . the list of files to be secured will be updated automatically according to the currently selected work folder .
&quot; for all folders listed under backup files , only the files located therein will be backed up as the folder . folders that are on other file systems can be added separately under backup files . each entry is considered by tar independent from the others . &quot;
&quot; to determine which files have changed since the last incre@@ mental backup , a snapshot file will be used . only the files that have changed since then . &quot;
the name of the file that is used to determine the changes since the last incre@@ mental backup .
delete the snapshot file before calling tar . this causes all files to be backed up and a new snapshot file will be created for the next backup .
the functionality of the buttons files &amp; gt ; s ; and lt ; files were not fully implemented at the time of creating this documentation .
you can set the settings using the menu item K@@ D@@ at ... in the Settings menu . the following settings can be done :
the complete path to device file for the tape drive ( usually / dev / tape ) . this path must refer to the non @-@ re@@ winding version of the tape recorder .
&quot; if this setting is active , transferred &amp; k@@ dat ; before the tape is integrated , the instruction will load to the drive . this is necessary for some drives before read or write operations are performed . &quot;
&quot; if the option is switched on , try &amp; k@@ dat ; block the ej@@ ection from the tape drive . possibly this setting does not work on all tape drives . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , the tape will automatically be dis@@ car@@ ded . do not use this option with Flo@@ ppy Stre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; if the option is enabled , try &amp; k@@ dat ; the hardware @-@ side block size for the tape drive . not all drives support variable block sizes . regardless of whether this setting is active or not , you need to tell the block size for your tape drive . &quot;
&quot; when &amp; dat ; a tape format@@ ted , it writes a file to the beginning of the tape . this file should display only one storage block on the tape . the contents of the file are composed as follows : &quot;
&quot; the format of this string is host@@ name : seconds , where host@@ name is the complete name of the system on which the volume was format@@ ted . &quot;
the band ID is used to find a file with the same name in the $ HO@@ ME / .@@ k@@ dat file .
&quot; the remaining files on the tape are tar archives , which can be managed directly with &amp; GNU ; - tar . even other tar versions should work as long as it is not incre@@ mental back@@ ups . &quot;
check the content of a backup tape . this icon is only active when a tape is integrated .
&quot; the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system or where the system provides the different protocol files . in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows experienced users to quickly access information on issues that appear on their server . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; helps users understand what your computer is in the background . the task of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; is a simplified representation of the protocol files of your own system . the program is suitable for inexperienced users who do not know where to get information about your system , or where the system is stored in the different protocol files . &quot;
&quot; in addition , &amp; k@@ system@@ log allows users to quickly access information about problems that occur on their server . &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; therefore attempts to provide some advanced features that can be used to filter and evaluate the protocol files of certain programs . &quot;
the current version 0.@@ 4.1 has a number of useful features . this includes :
&quot; support for many different types of log files , for the sy@@ slo@@ g server format and for sam@@ ba &quot;
many other functions are also included and are explained in the further chapters of this manual .
&quot; as you can see in the following screen@@ shot , it provides &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; functions with which the single protocol lines of a protocol file can be easily filtered and sorted . the individual options for sorting and filtering are shown in the next chapter of this manual . &quot;
&quot; after the start trying &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; first the most important protocol file of the system - the system protocol - will not be shown to you , and it opens up instead of a small message window , so you have not started with system administrators . &quot;
&quot; you can also use the filter bar to filter for a selected criterion or string . to do this , enter a string in the filter bar . the list of the log lines will now be displayed automatically , so that only the protocol lines will be displayed next to the filter . then a protocol line will only be displayed if the string of the filter search term is included in one of the columns . &quot;
&quot; you can also select another entry at this point . the string of the filter search term is then only checked with entries in the corresponding column . in addition , in the protocol file system protocol , select the column process , and in addition , enter the name of a process in the filter bar , so show you &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; all protocol lines that have been sent or created by this process . &quot;
this option is enabled in the default setting and helps you to recognize the important protocol lines . protocol lines of level error are displayed with a more eye @-@ catching color than minutes lines of level indicator . the color representation of protocol lines can be dis@@ connected setup dialog .
&quot; if you want to show only certain processes ( e.g. in the system protocol or in the C@@ ron protocol ) , you can hide the process identification ( PID ) in the process column . this may , for example , be useful if you want to examine the output of a specific command such as the startup of the sam@@ ba server . &quot;
&quot; in addition , you can use the To add new lines to the main window &apos;s context menu to view all new log messages . &quot;
&quot; &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; allows to display multiple protocol files in separate sub@@ windows . to use this feature , use the entries in the Windows menu to open and manage additional sub @-@ windows . once you have selected a sub@@ window , select a protocol to display in the menu . &quot;
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; has its own website on ht@@ t@@ p : / / k@@ system@@ log@@ .@@ forum @-@ softwar@@ e.@@ or@@ g. d@@ ort you can find further up @-@ to @-@ date information about the sources of &amp; k@@ system@@ log ; .
&amp; k@@ system@@ log ; also find in the following folder of the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ Subversion repository : k@@ system@@ log ; in the &amp; k@@ de ; -@@ archive
&quot; welcome to the &amp; k@@ de ; System V In@@ it Editor , rather known ( and in the following also named ) as &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; . this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v . &quot;
&quot; system V In@@ it is rapidly becoming the standard for the control of program starts when it comes to running the system in the &amp; Linux world . this is because it is easier to use , more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD in@@ it . &quot;
I will not go further on historical aspects here ( e.g. because I don &apos;t know about it myself : - ) .
&quot; the in@@ it binary file is under / s@@ bin and not under / etc . this is important because maybe someone might try to convert a machine to System V In@@ it , without making a re @-@ installation and re @-@ format@@ ting . Linux ; kernel looks first under / etc after an in@@ it file . therefore , you must ensure that the old in@@ it was removed from there if there was one . &quot;
&quot; the Sy@@ s@@ V In@@ it differs also from the BSD in@@ it that the configuration files are located in a sub@@ folder of / etc instead of directly in / etc . this folder is named r@@ c.@@ sy@@ s@@ it , and the following additional folders : &quot;
&quot; system services include such things as network , NFS , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , ht@@ tp@@ d &amp; etc ; system services do not include such things as set@@ serial , which is only started once . such calls belong to r@@ c.@@ local . &quot;
&quot; for your part , r@@ c.@@ local should be in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you need it . most systems have this file , even if there is not much use for it . you can also set up r@@ c.@@ serial in / etc / r@@ c.@@ d if you want to do something with the serial port . &quot;
the kernel looks in@@ it at different places after the program and starts the first one he finds .
the default run@@ level is in / etc / init@@ tab . you should see in the beginning area a line like the following :
&quot; at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably state that the default run@@ level is 3 . if you want to change it , then you can edit / etc / init@@ tab manually and change the 3 . if you have a bit mess@@ ed up , then you will be able to repair it by re@@ boot the system and run the following : &quot;
&quot; but how does it start all the correct scripts ? if you type ls -@@ l in r@@ c@@ 3.@@ d , then you will probably see something like the following : &quot;
&quot; you will notice that in this folder there are no correct files . instead , each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init@@ .@@ d directory . &quot;
how to start and stop in@@ it actually system services ? quite simple : each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop . you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows :
&quot; this would stop the ht@@ tp@@ d server . in@@ it reads the name , and if it contains a K , the script will be called with the argument stop . if it contains an S , the script will be called with the start argument . &quot;
&quot; some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes . I could have a server running level running only ht@@ tp@@ d , &amp; Send@@ mail ; , Network &amp; etc ; , Network &amp; etc ; , Network &amp; etc . &quot;
here you will learn how to use &amp; sy@@ s@@ v ; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user @-@ friendly as possible .
the use of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say tri@@ vial : simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running level to start ( or stop ) at this level .
&quot; you can also move scripts between Run@@ level , or change the position within a level by setting it somewhere else . this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services . &quot;
&quot; note : entries are moved when you move them to a new area . to simply copy them to a new run@@ level , you must explicitly copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action . &quot;
&quot; the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated . in such a case , you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service . &quot;
note : there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recy@@ cle bin . so be careful .
&quot; you can use the tab@@ ul@@ ator button to activate the different working areas ( available system services , Run@@ level 1 Start , Run@@ level 1 Stop &amp; etc ; ) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one . &quot;
&quot; to move an entry to another run@@ level , move it with cut into the clip@@ board ( you can also use C@@ trl ; X ) and add it to the desired run@@ level ( with C@@ trl ; V ) . &quot;
&quot; to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually , press the input button to change the properties dialog . use the Tab button to change the properties dialog . close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes , or press Es@@ c to disc@@ ard the changes . &quot;
&quot; because of the risk of data loss , all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed . &quot;
all settings are stored in $ K@@ DE@@ HO@@ ME / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c . preferences are taken from the global file ( $ K@@ DE@@ DI@@ R / share / config / k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c ) if available . otherwise they will be restored by &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; changes to the default settings are stored in a local k@@ sy@@ sv@@ r@@ c .
&quot; I experim@@ ented with the standard run@@ level , and now the machine is constantly re@@ building . what can I do ? &quot;
enter the LI@@ LO prompt lin@@ ux single and press the input button to start in single user mode . then edit the file / etc / init@@ tab and change the default run@@ level to a reasonable value ( 3 should normally be fine ) .
&quot; I have some system services with &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; for running under run@@ level X , but they are not executed . &quot;
if you are using &amp; Su@@ SE ; or Deli@@ x ( D@@ LD ) you need to edit additional files in / etc which are only available in these distri@@ butions . please read the details in the manual of the distribution .
&quot; the way system services are started in these distri@@ butions , simpli@@ fies the configuration for proprietary alignment programs of these distri@@ butions , but unfortunately does not correspond to any standard . authors of &amp; k@@ sy@@ s@@ v ; plan an extension of the program for this approach . &quot;
&quot; if you are using a different distribution : please check that all configuration files are available , which are required by the respective system service ( and whether they are in the correct directory ) . some services ( such as &amp; eg ; Apache or ht@@ tp@@ d ) simply end without a message if their configuration files are not present or in@@ correctly set up . &quot;
&quot; the meaning of the &amp; Linux ; -@@ Run@@ level varies from distribution to distribution , can even be different from version to version . if you are using a different distribution , please send me information about the running level to be added to this manual . &quot;
this documentation refers to &amp; k@@ user ; 1.0 . with this program you can manage the users and groups of your system .
to start with &amp; k@@ user ; it is sufficient to read the chapter Adap@@ tation of &amp; k@@ user ; to start reading .
&quot; after you have made changes , you need to save them . either use the corresponding symbol of the tool@@ bar or the entry in the File menu . &quot;
&quot; the main window consists of two card cards , the user and the user group list . to edit , select the desired user or group with a double click on the entry . &quot;
&quot; some card cards are only displayed if you have made advanced system settings . only if you have enabled space restrictions ( quot@@ a ) for users , a card card will be created on which you can make individual settings . other card cards may appear if shadow passwords or for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d are installed as in BSD @-@ Uni@@ xes . &quot;
&quot; the password management card appears , if shadow passwords , for example / etc / master@@ .@@ pass@@ w@@ d , are installed as in BSD uni@@ xes . &quot;
this card only appears if for at least one fil@@ esystem space restriction ( quot@@ a ) is activated and initi@@ alized ( recognizable by the file quot@@ a.@@ user / quot@@ a.@@ group on the file system ) .
these parameters can be set individually for each fil@@ esystem . the current file system is selected with the help of the field file system with space restriction .
&quot; the card group informs you about the group belonging to the selected user . the default group , to which the user belongs , can be found in the Prim@@ ary Group . furthermore , the user can become a member in other groups by marking them in the large field . &quot;
&quot; the Group dialog features a list of all users . to add a user to the group , mark this user in the list . &quot;
&quot; to add a user or group , select Add from the user or group menu or click the matching Add button of the tool@@ bar . editing or del@@ eting the selected user or group will work similarly . &quot;
&quot; with this module you can install the LI@@ LO boot manager , add , remove , and change the boot password , add the time to boot the default operating system , add , remove , change operating systems , remove , change and more . &quot;
