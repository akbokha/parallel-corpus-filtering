<seg id="12">"to use DOM tree view in & konqueror; to use, select Extras DOM tree... and open a new window with DOM of the currently displayed website. as default, the display starts with the root note of the document, example: documentElement, all other nodes are elements of this root node."</seg>
<seg id="13">The Module & FSView; for & konqueror; represents another view for objects with the MIME type inode / directory in local files. it can be used as an alternative for the various symbol and text views to view the content of your local file system.</seg>
<seg id="14">The specificity of & FSView; consists in representing nested folder hierarchies by means of a so-called Tree-Map. tree-Maps allow the representation of the size of objects in nested structures. each object is represented by a rectangle whose surface is proportional to its size. this size must have the property that the sum of the size of the subordinate objects of an object is smaller or equal to the size of the object.</seg>
<seg id="15">"at & FSView; the size is the size of a file or folder, where the size of a folder is defined as the sum of the size of the entries in it. thus, large files can be easily recognized even if it is far down in the folder hierarchy. therefore, & FSView; as a graphical and interactive version of the & UNIX; command you are considered."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in & FSView, an entry in the Treemap is a rectangle that represents a file or folder in your filesystem."</seg>
<seg id="17">"the color of a rectangle, which is switched over view color mode, can either represent depth for the easy detection of the nesting depth or the image of another file property such as name, owner, group or MIME type."</seg>
<seg id="18">"a rectangle can be labeled with the different properties of the corresponding file or folder. for each feature, you can specify whether or not it is displayed at all, only if there is sufficient space for representation or whether the area should be used by the character of the treemap. furthermore, you can specify the relative position of the caption in the rectangle."</seg>
<seg id="19">"for Treemap in the Treemap in & FSView, this goal is not always maintained. frames are drawn to represent the nesting of entries, and this frame will need room, which will then no longer be available to subordinate entries. note that less space for the frame is lost when square is square."</seg>
<seg id="20">"how splitting the area of an entry for the subordinate entries is left to the implementation. here, it is possible to divide the areas in such a way for the labeling and avoidance of space losses through frames, that rectangles are created which are as square as possible. the best methods concerning this are rows, columns or recursive division."</seg>
<seg id="21">"you can set the minimally displayed area for an entry on the menu entry view on area. instead, a space pattern is drawn in the area of the parent item to indicate that this area is actually occupied by a subordinate entry."</seg>
<seg id="22">"originally, the FSView was designed as a small test application and introduction to the use of the TreeMap widget developed for KCachegrind application."</seg>

<seg id="71">"the support is based on the libraw library. if you want to find out if a special camera is supported, you will find a list of supported raw cameras in the Help RohCamera Support menu."</seg>
<seg id="72">How to set up this and work with raw files is described in the sections Roh DecoderSettings and Roh workflow.</seg>
<seg id="73">"an easy-to-use camera interface is provided for you to connect to your digital camera and download your photos directly in & digicam; albums. more than 1000 digital cameras are supported using the gphoto2 library. of course, any medium and any card reader supported by your operating system will work with & digicam."</seg>
<seg id="74">Modern digital cameras are characterized by the use of Compact & Flash; Memory Cards and USB or FireWire (IEEE-1394 or i-Link) for data transfer. the camera is then used as a disk drive. the connection can also be realized via Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP) and its derivatives. older cameras may use the serial port (RS-232).</seg>
<seg id="75">"photo2 is a free, distributed software collection for digital cameras that supports an ever increasing number of over 800 cameras. gPhoto2 also supports Picture Transfer Protocol, a widely distributed protocol that was developed by the International Imaging Industry Association. it allows the transfer of images from digital cameras to computers and other peripheral devices without the need for additional drivers."</seg>
<seg id="76">Many old digital cameras use the serial port for their communication with the computer. since photos in general are large files and transmissions via the serial port are slow this connection is now obsolete. & digicam; supports these cameras and guides the transfer of images with gPhoto2. a complete list of supported cameras can be found under this link.</seg>
<seg id="77">"libgphoto2 must have been created with libexif support to read the preview images from digiKam. if the Exif support is not available in libgphoto2, you might not be able to view thumbnails or the creation could be very slow."</seg>
<seg id="78">One of the most beautiful things at & digikam; is how simple its functionality can be extended by modules:</seg>
<seg id="79">KIPI modules: the KDE image plug-ins Interface Project (manual) is an approach to develop a common module structure for & digikam. the aim is to provide the modules to all graphics programs. the settings for the KIPI modules are described in this section.</seg>
<seg id="80">"modules can manipulate images in virtually any way, as a user can. their advantage is that it is much simpler, & digicode; by writing a small module to add a function when the changes in & edited; itself perform."</seg>
<seg id="81">"to simplify the window, you can either remove the page bars with & LMB; or change to fullscreen mode with F11 or Ctrl + Shift + F."</seg>
<seg id="82">"drag and drop images will work everywhere: you can place an image in another part of the Albenign tree, above the horizontal separator line or into another application window. the only limitation is that an image is not to drop in keywords, date list or search."</seg>
<seg id="83">"a file type selection allows you to extract the most common: JPEG, PNG, TIFF, Roh, movies and audio"</seg>
<seg id="84">"the text filter is used only for the fields displayed in the toolbar. this way, the filter works on the file name only if it is displayed in the toolview."</seg>
<seg id="85">"view & quot; My Albenlistequot; places an organized view on your photo albums. all the photos that were edited by & digikam are stored in a single album tree. these albums can be sorted according to the folders in which they were stored on the hard drive, after the name of their collection in the alenames or after the date on which the album was created first. the date can be changed in the properties of the album."</seg>
<seg id="86">"if you have created a scanner, you can also scan a photo directly into an album. you can also scan a screenshot directly to an album."</seg>
<seg id="87">"to copy or move an image from one album to another, you can move the photo with the mouse to the target album and drop it. in the pop-up menu you will need to select or copy several photos. simply select all the photos and move them to the target album."</seg>

<seg id="89">"album collections: are a method to mark your albums so that you can be grouped under a common name. the collection you use will be used to sort your photos, if you want to add or delete new collections, you can make this in the collections for collections."</seg>
<seg id="90">The Album- Date: is used when you sort your albums by date with View albums sorted by date.</seg>
<seg id="91">"the buttons eldest, average, new testers: they set the date on that of the oldest, the newest picture or that of the average of the album. to do this, first try to calculate the average of the images from their EXIF information. if this fails, the date of the last modification of each file is used in this folder."</seg>
<seg id="92">"when you first have an album in & digikam, the first picture in the album will be chosen as a symbol for the & quot; My Albenlistequot; this will help you to remember the photos in the album. sometimes, the first photo in the album is not representative and you might want to select another photo as a symbol."</seg>

<seg id="94">An album can always be included in a collection and collections cannot be nested.</seg>
<seg id="95">Album collections have a different effect. you can of course use both methods to organize your photos.</seg>
<seg id="96">"the image window provides you with the main view of your photos. if you select an album, all pictures in this album will be displayed in the image window. each photo is displayed in a preview, you can adjust the size of this preview with the two magnifying buttons in the toolbar."</seg>

<seg id="229">This question should actually be answered by explanations in this document. use or change to open standards that are supported by many applications.</seg>
<seg id="230">Virtualization is available for everyone nowadays. so if you have an old system that is important to read your pictures then store it and install it in a virtual machine for later use.</seg>
<seg id="231">"on the other hand, the advice is quite simple: every time you change your computer architecture, memory and backup technology, or your file format, you should check your library and if necessary convert to a newer standard. stay with open standards."</seg>

<seg id="237">"GIF is a proprietary format which slowly disappears from the market, so you should not use it anymore."</seg>
<seg id="238">"PNG was designed as an open source standard to replace GIF. it can however much more. it is lossless, supports XMP, Exinf and IPTC metadata, 16-bit per color channel and full transparency. PNG is able to use relative many administrative information, but not as many as TIFF and have a slow compression."</seg>
<seg id="239">TIFF was widely used as image format. TIFF can be stored in uncompressed form or in a container with a lossless compression algorithm (Deflate). it manages images in high quality but requires very large files. with some cameras you can store your pictures in this format. there is therefore more than 50 different types and not all applications can work with all types.</seg>
<seg id="240">DNG The digital Negative file format is a license-free and open source format that was developed by Adobe Systems. it is based on the TIFF / EP format and is committed to the use of metadata. a handful of camera manufacturers is now available and we hope that the competitors Canon and Nikon can also use it at some point.</seg>
<seg id="241">"this may be one of the reasons why, around 2001, Adobe introduced its XML-based XMP technology to replace the & quot; Image resource block quot; XMP stands for & quot; Extensible Metadata Platformquot;, a mixture of XML and RDF. the file information is stored with the extension & quot; .xmpquot; stored for XML / RDF."</seg>
<seg id="242">"many photographers prefer to archive the original of your photo, mostly in the raw format. XMP adapts to it since it stores the metadata separately from the image file. however, it can cause problems in connection between the metadata file and the image file. therefore, you should consider whether you use DNG as a container and put everything together."</seg>

<seg id="377">"the reason why you use a color-managed workflow is that the colors that come from your camera or scanner will have a predictable deviation from the actually photographed or scanned colors. with a color-managed workflow, you can achieve that the colors on your monitor correspond to those of your camera or scanner and that correspond to the colors you print or publish in the web to those from your digital darkroom."</seg>
<seg id="378">"when the theme is based on color management, everyone wants to know which buttons he wants to press for the results he wants. unfortunately, color management means that you make informed decisions at any point in the image processing workflows. in addition, you should provide you with sufficient background information about color management. in addition, you should make links with deeper information to make your own informed choices so that you get the desired result."</seg>

<seg id="388">"this tool provides five automatic corrections that can improve a picture in most cases. therefore, use it before attempting any further manual processing."</seg>
<seg id="389">"the functions normalize, adjust, Automatic balance and contrast extend from the Menu Correcting Automatic correction automatically try to make your colors the best. you will need to experiment with these effects to see which works best in your photo."</seg>
<seg id="390">Normalize: this method scales the leukvelocity values across the whole picture so that the darkest dot is black and the brightest point as brightly as possible without changing its shade. this function is often a magic correction for images that are dark or balanced.</seg>
<seg id="391">"this method mimics the intensity channel of the colors of the selected image, so that the histogram of the intensity channel becomes as flat as possible. sometimes, the comparison results in very good results when improving the contrast of an image, sometimes it produces only rubbish. it is a very powerful operation that either causes miracles in a picture or destroys it."</seg>
<seg id="392">"automatic levelling: this method maximizes the colour range in the red, green and blue channel."</seg>
<seg id="393">Add a contrast: this method improves the contrast and brightness of the RGB values of an image by shifting the lowest and highest values to the greatest possible range and a new jib of all values in between. this is only visible in washed images and can be a good correction for poor photos.</seg>
<seg id="394">White balance from & digikam; is a semi-automatic tool to perform the white balance of a photo.</seg>
<seg id="395">"the white balance correction is slightly limited because of a colour space with 8-bit per color. if you can be too far from the original picture, areas with overexposure may occur. if you can perform the white balance in raw mode, which works in 16-bit mode, your options for correction will be better."</seg>
<seg id="396">This tool is based on a white balance algorithm which is protected by Pawel T. Jochym. they start it over the menu entry colors white balance of image processing.</seg>
<seg id="397">"the preview window can be adjusted in size. on the left, both the original picture and the preview of the target image can be seen. the preview will dynamically change the settings of the tool. if you want to see the original white balance again, then it is enough to click on the subwindow."</seg>
<seg id="398">The preview of the target image has a red marker. the luminance of the pixel under this marker is displayed as a vertical line in the histogram.</seg>
<seg id="399">"at the top right, a histogram is displayed that changes dynamically as soon as you change a parameter. this histogram is very helpful, even in well-lit pictures, most pixels have very small luminance values."</seg>
<seg id="400">"the contrast of your result depends on shadows, saturation and gamma. the shadow adjustment lets you improve or dim the shadow details of your photos."</seg>
<seg id="401">"to play Anstat with the above controls, you should use the color temperature pipette. press this button and then somewhere on the image preview to use the chosen colour to calculate the color temperature of the white balance."</seg>
<seg id="402">"in addition, you can set the white balance to the list of preferences. the following settings are available:"</seg>
<seg id="403">The exposure indicator increases the colors when more than one color channel of the pixel is overexposed.. You will see the combined result displayed in the white balance. this will appear in the preview as a pure indicator and has no effect on the final image.</seg>
<seg id="404">The Save as and Load Buttons make exactly that. each setting of the white balance you have set can save you to a text file and then load it again later.</seg>
<seg id="405">"the Preferences button returns all filter values to its default values and the associated neutral white balance. note that also neutral settings will result in a different photo than your original. if you save this, your original image will be changed."</seg>
<seg id="406">"8-bit coding is the widely used JPEG format, 16-bit coding is better suited for high-quality images. however, this coding also requires more disk space, computing time and is only available for the formats PNG, PNM, TIFF and DNG."</seg>
<seg id="407">This tool opens the same dialog as the editing of color profiles. it uses the change and assignment of color profiles.</seg>
<seg id="408">"another important tool is available in the menu under shades of tone correction. this tool provides an integrated way to adjust multiple color channels at the same time, so that you can use them for several photos. this is helpful if your camera or scanners always need the same error, so you will always need the same correction."</seg>
<seg id="409">A very powerful way to correct exposure problems is the tool for gradation that you can find under colors gradation in the menu.</seg>
<seg id="410">"the digicode; tool color effects provide four color effects, a solar system effect, a Velvia filter, a neon effect and a canter filter."</seg>
<seg id="411">"in times of chemical processing, it was called Sabatier, also known as Sabatier. the coloured, darker areas protected the sensitive photo paper from the additional light. this had the effect that the lighter areas darker and the colors were inverted by the second light. this tool allows you to adjust this interesting effect fine."</seg>
<seg id="412">The intensity controls the Solarisation. at about 50% intensity the picture shows what is chemically possible. another increase finally creates a negative image that is not to be produced on photo paper.</seg>
<seg id="413">This is an example of the Solarisation effect. the original image is the (1) and this is processed (2). the applied intensity is 30%.</seg>
<seg id="414">"the Vivid filter simulates the so-called & quot; Velviaquot; effect. it differs from a saturation by making a stronger contrast effect, which makes the colors brilliant and glowing. just try it, it embellishes many photos."</seg>
<seg id="415">Velvia is the brand name for an inverted color film produced by the Japanese company Fujifilm. the name is a composition of & quot; Velvet Mediaquot; and therefore a reference for its smooth image structure. Velvia offers very saturated colors in daylight and high contrasts.</seg>
<seg id="416">The neon filter simulates neon light on the contrast edges. the parameter level controls the brightness of the result and the slider repetitions the strength of the neon light.</seg>
<seg id="417">Digital cameras often have problems with light conditions and it is not uncommon to change the color contrast and intensity of the photo. you can experiment with the different color aspects of your photo with the tools in the menu under colors. all your adjustments can be viewed in the preview.</seg>
<seg id="418">"if you make a photo in poor light conditions, you can get the opposite problem: a too large saturation. also in this case, the tool for brightness / saturation is a good choice to reduce saturation rather than increase it. if you like the result, you can confirm the changes with Ok."</seg>
<seg id="419">"between the complex mould gradation and the simple luminous intensity / contrast / gamma, the tool is based on toning correction for improving exposure. even if the dialog to this tool works very complicated, you need only the range of sliders for the application described here. more concrete the three sliders below the histogram."</seg>
<seg id="420">"the window contains a graph of intensity values, a histogram, the active channel or the selected area. below the graph three sliders can be clicked in and that can be moved to change the intensity values of the image. the left side represents the dark and the right side the bright areas."</seg>
<seg id="421">The easiest way to learn the operation is to move the controls and take care of how the picture changes.</seg>
<seg id="422">"the preview will be updated dynamically, based on the settings of the image. on the left side, the following options are available."</seg>
<seg id="423">Scaling: this selection box can be used to determine whether the histogram is displayed with a linear or logarithmic Y axis. for images of a digital camera the linear histogram is often dominated by a single pillar. in this case the logarithmic classification is more useful.</seg>
<seg id="424">"three controls: the top for the dark tones, the middle for the light tones and the lowest for the middle tones, often called gamma values."</seg>
<seg id="425">"the three color pipettes can be used in the preview of the original image to adjust the input values of shadows, middle and light tones automatically. in addition, there is a button for a fully automatic adjustment."</seg>

<seg id="479">& digicam; provides three different tools to focus. each of you has benefits in other areas.</seg>
<seg id="480">"sharpening is a traditional tool for sharpening. it is very fast and easy, but generates, especially in dark areas, grainy images."</seg>
<seg id="481">"blurred mask works on the contrast of the edges to make a picture sharper look blurred. actually, it does not work a bit, it works rather psychovisual. you can use it to remove atmospheric haze and it makes here a really good job. the algorithm was taken from Gimp and it is protected by Winston Chang."</seg>
<seg id="482">Refocusing is perhaps the best of the three since it really improves the sharpness. it is a little more complicated in its application and has various parameters for adjustment.</seg>
<seg id="483">Images without focus as well as most digitized images require a correction of the sharpness. this is because of the digitization process colours with only minimal differences to a color point. this in turn results in sharp edges becoming a little blurred. the same phenomenon can be observed when color points are printed on paper. SLR cameras usually need more subsequently sharpening than normal cameras for private users.</seg>
<seg id="484">"in JPEG images, a camera has often been used for internal sharpening. however, pictures in the raw format must always be sharpened during processing."</seg>
<seg id="485">"some scanners use a focus filter already during the reading of the image. if you deactivate it, you get control over your image."</seg>
<seg id="486">In some situations you can get useful results by sharpening a photo using the sharpening tool. you can use this with the menu entry Correcting sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="487">"the sharpness increases the sharpness of the edges, but also amplifies the noise. in general, the most useful technique for sharpening an image will refocus the tool. you will find further information and a comparison of all techniques to sharpening through the menu entry."</seg>
<seg id="488">Sometimes you have the opposite problem: a picture is too crisp. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is much easier than to sharpen. use the tool for softer with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment with settings. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows you the effect on your photo.</seg>
<seg id="489">The filter Unsharp mask is a very good tool to remove veil from your photos. a demonstration can be seen here.</seg>
<seg id="490">The original image and the preview help to edit the image. the preview window shows the output of the filter with the current settings.</seg>
<seg id="491">"there are two important parameters, the radius and the amount. the default values often produce good results and should first be tried. an increase in radius or viewing amplify the effect."</seg>
<seg id="492">The radius represents how many pixels on each side of an edge are affected by the filter. high-resolution images allow larger radii.</seg>
<seg id="493">"the amount represents the percentage between the original and the blurred image, which is added to the original. thus, the strength of the sharpness is set."</seg>
<seg id="494">"the threshold value is a fraction of the maximum RGB value and the difference in difference. thus, a minimum difference can be defined for an edge of the filter. thus, areas with a soft change between the tones are excluded from sharpness and hence beauty defects in faces, heavens and water surfaces are avoided."</seg>
<seg id="495">"the original image is the (1) and the processed image (2). unsharp mask was used with radius = 6.0, amount = 0.5 and a threshold value = 0.0."</seg>
<seg id="496">The & digicode; tool refocus refocuses a picture by improving the sharpness. it used the copyrighted extraction filter algorithm by Ernst Lippe.</seg>
<seg id="497">This is a better approach than just trying to sharpen the photo. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. it uses a technique called FIR Wiener Filtering. the traditional technique for sharpening images is the use of a blurred mask.</seg>
<seg id="498">"the Gauss's folding has a very long tail, which results in the mathematical result also from the source pixeln, which is far from the original source pixel, which results in most cases even very strongly influenced by the distant pixels. it causes unwanted results."</seg>
<seg id="499">"circular sharpness: this is the radius of the circular folding. it is the most important parameter for using this module. for most images, the default value should give 1 good results."</seg>
<seg id="500">"correlation: an increase in correlation may help to reduce artifacts. the correlation may be selected from 0-1. useful values are 0.5 and the values near 1, & eg; 0.95 and 0.99. a high value for correlation reduces the sharper effect of the module."</seg>
<seg id="501">"noise filter: an increase in the noise filter can help you to reduce artifacts. the filter can take values of 0-1. however, values higher than 0.1 are rarely helpful. if the noise filter is too low, & eg; 0 the image quality becomes very bad."</seg>
<seg id="502">"sharpness: this is the radius for the palate. use this parameter if your sharpness is gauze. in most cases, you should leave this value to 0 to avoid annoying artifacts. if you use a value unequal to zero, you may also need to increase the correlation and / or the noise filter."</seg>
<seg id="503">"matrix Size: this value determines the size of the transformation matrix. an increase in the matrix size can produce good results, especially if you select large values for the circular sharpness or the palate. in most cases, you should choose a value in the range of 3-10."</seg>
<seg id="504">The Save as and Load Buttons are used for this purpose. any refocused parameters you have set will be saved for later and can then be loaded.</seg>
<seg id="505">"try to perform all trimming, color and intensity corrections on the image before using the module."</seg>
<seg id="506">"otherwise, you should use the module before changing the image otherwise. the reason for this is that many operations changes that are not immediately visible, but later leave unpleasant artefacts."</seg>
<seg id="507">"when you read and compress images, eg; than JPEG, you should apply the module to the uncompressed image."</seg>
<seg id="508">Generally Unintensely Masking produces better results than sharpening. this could be caused by unintentional masking a larger neighbourhood used as sharpening.</seg>
<seg id="509">"theoretically, unsharp mask must always produce artefacts. even under optimal conditions, it can never remove the effect of blurring. for the Viennese filter it is impossible to show that it is the optimum Lineare Filter. the FIR Vienna filter is often better in processing small details."</seg>
<seg id="510">Below you can see a comparison between the different filters used on a small unfocused image:</seg>
<seg id="511">The original unsharp ink that needs to be corrected. this image has been made with an analog camera. the unfocused result is due to insufficient light for the auto focus lens.</seg>
<seg id="512">For more information on the focus correction methods in digital pictures you can read a technical comparison in English under this address.</seg>
<seg id="513">The Glätte knob uses the blurring of the area that has been darkened to create a more natural pupil.</seg>
<seg id="514">"the ink ink allows for a modified colour for the pupil. if you want to use blue eyes instead of dark ones, you can adjust this here."</seg>
<seg id="515">The tool image error correction is one of the most widely developed tools to remove unwanted artifacts with unprecedented speed.</seg>
<seg id="516">The Inpainting algorithm was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project.</seg>
<seg id="517">This tool contains various presets as starting points to simplify the restoration. the available presets are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="518">"if you want to adjust the filter settings more finely, you can use the tab smoothing and advanced settings."</seg>
<seg id="519">"detailed maintenance p [0, 100]: this controls the maintenance of the details. a small value leads to an even smoothness over the picture. a value of 0.9 should be kept for details so that no sharpening is necessary afterwards."</seg>
<seg id="520">Direction dependency Alpha [0.100]: a small value smoothes evenly across all directions while a value close to 1 is smoothed in one direction. if you have a film granulator or CCD noise will generate a high value wave-like patterns. JPEG Artefacts are best removed at a value near 1.</seg>
<seg id="521">"smoothing [0, 500]: this sets the maximum smoothing factor above allit. p then defines the relative smoothing. therefore set this value to the degree of noise in your image."</seg>
<seg id="522">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary when there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>
<seg id="523">Repeat: specifies how often the algorithm is going through. normally here 1 or 2 is sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="524">"angle-range da [5, 90]: angle-dependent integration of anisotropic alpha. if Alpha is selected small, it should also be small. make sure that small angles get a long runtime. so you should choose this value as much as possible and acceptable for your needs."</seg>
<seg id="525">"integral step width [0,1, 10]: integral stride width in pixels. you should set the value smaller 1 to avoid sub-pixel smoothing and never greater than 2."</seg>
<seg id="526">Use linear interpolation: the more the quality you receive by selecting this option is only minor. it doubles the duration. we therefore recommend it to leave it out.</seg>
<seg id="527">The Save as and Load Buttons make exactly this. correct any setting of image errors can be saved in a text file and then loaded again later.</seg>
<seg id="528">"correcting image errors is comparatively very fast at work. however, it can take a very long time and drag a high CPU load. therefore, you can cancel the calculation at any time with the Cancel button."</seg>

<seg id="535">"radius controls the window size, from 1 (3x3) to 20 (41x41) used for the filter. large values increase the time the filter needs per pixel and can blur the image. the area indicated by the radius moves over the image and the color in it is smoothed and therefore cuts smaller faults."</seg>
<seg id="536">"sharpness: controls the sharpness level. this value sets the pixel spacing the filter looks forward to determine luminance changes. if the value is too high, the adaptive filter image details cannot be maintained and noise or lubricating occurs again."</seg>
<seg id="537">"this value improves the frequency response of the filter. if it is too strong, not the entire noise can be removed or crawler tips can occur. set it to a value close to the maximum if you want to remove a weak noise or JPEG artefacts without losing details."</seg>
<seg id="538">Luminance: controls the luminance tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="539">Color: controls the color tolerance of the image. we recommend to change color or luminance to improve a picture. these settings do not affect the smoothing process that is controlled by the details settings.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gamma: controls the tolerance variance of the image. this value can be used to increase the tolerance values of darker areas, which are typically stronger, but also smears the shadow areas."</seg>
<seg id="541">"damping: controls adjustment of phase jitter absorption. this value defines how fast the adaptive filter radius reacts to variations of luminance. if it is increased, the edges appear smoother when it is too high."</seg>
<seg id="542">Store under and load: these buttons are used exactly for that. all parameters for the noise reduction you have set can be stored in the file system and later loaded.</seg>
<seg id="543">This is an example of how noise reduction can change your life. the original image is marked with (1) and the corrected with (2).</seg>
<seg id="544">Sometimes a picture is too crisp for your purpose. the solution to draw the picture a little soft is fortunately much easier than to sharpen a picture. use tool for softer with the menu entry Correct softness and experiment with the smoothness. the preview window on the right side of the dialog shows the effect of this operation on your photo.</seg>

<seg id="603">The lines that define the outline in drawing are highlighted. images whose gradients are slowly changing are therefore not ideal for this effect. it is helpful if you imagine what scene you have chosen to outline you. this would be good pictures to begin with.</seg>
<seg id="604">There are two controllers with a range of 1 to 100 to control this effect. the upper knob selects the pin size and the lower knob contrasts the contrast (smooth).</seg>
<seg id="605">This is an example of the carbon capture filter. the original image (1) and the changed image (2). the default settings of 30 and 10 were used. the result can be further improved by adjusting the intensity value.</seg>

<seg id="612">Wave blocks 2: similar to the wave blocks 1 the picture is distorted with another version of glass blocks.</seg>
<seg id="613">Some effects need a long time to calculate and produce a high CPU load. you can cancel these effects anytime with the button Finish.</seg>
<seg id="614">With this filter group you can transform a normal photo into a work of art by means of blurring effects. it uses copyrighted algorithms from Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="615">Zoom blurring: blurring the image along star-shaped lines that emanate from one point. this simulates the blurring of a zooming camera and thus creates a dynamic expression of the often in sports photography.</seg>
<seg id="616">Radial blurring: blurring the image by turning the pixels around a center. this simulates the blurring of a rotating camera.</seg>
<seg id="617">Distance blurring: blurring the image to create the effect of a non-focused camera lens. the object appears to appear in the background.</seg>
<seg id="618">"blurring: blurring the image by horizontal movements of pixels. this simulates the blurring of a linear moving, z: B: from a car or train, camera."</seg>
<seg id="619">"blurring blurring: blurring the image soft in the dark and strong in the bright tones. this creates photos with a dreamy and shiny soft focus effect (Hamilton effect). this is ideal for creating romantic portraits, glamour photos or adding a warm and subtle glow."</seg>
<seg id="620">Schüttelno sharpness: blurring the image by means of random shifting of pixels and thereby simulates the blurring of an arbitrary moving camera.</seg>
<seg id="621">Intelligent blur: finds the color basin in the picture and wipes it without changing the rest.</seg>
<seg id="622">"mosaic: splits the photo into rectangular cells and then creates it, through the filling with an average pixel value, new."</seg>
<seg id="623">Some effects need a long time to calculate and cause a high CPU load.</seg>
<seg id="624">Raindrops are a nice little tool to make raindrops on your picture. this gives natural lightness to your images. it uses a protected algorithm by Pieter Voloshyn.</seg>
<seg id="625">Droplet size allows to change the size of drops. as the droplet size does not automatically grow with the size of the image it is often necessary to reduce the size for small images.</seg>
<seg id="626">"use the selection tool to select the area, e.g. a face that should remain free. if you start the filter raindrops, the area will remain free of raindrops."</seg>
<seg id="627">This is an example of the raindrops Filters. the original picture (1) shows a quiet sunset and the edited image (2) indicates a sunset after a storm. the default values were used for this example.</seg>

<seg id="629">Photo-blisters is definitely one of the most advanced tools to enlarge a photo with minimal loss of image quality.</seg>
<seg id="630">"the big question is, how can you inflate a picture and keep the details sharp? how can you zoom into a picture once the limits of the resolution are reached? how can you find the missing information again or guess? the CImg algorithm used here makes a good job. try it and you will see it yourself."</seg>
<seg id="631">"if a photo has the wrong size, you can scale it to the desired size with the tool size. choose to change size change in the menu and enter the target values."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the tool for size modifies a linear interpolation method to approximate the pixels. if you want to enlarge a small picture with a better quality, then try the tool to inflate."</seg>
<seg id="633">"many picture editing programs use a kind of interpolation, e.g. spline interpolation to enlarge a picture. & digicam; uses a further developed approach. the underlying algorithm photo was developed by the IMAGE team of the Grec CNRS labs in Caen / France and is part of the CImg project."</seg>
<seg id="634">You have to tell the tool how you want to change the size. these settings are available in the tab New size and are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="635">"maintain page ratio: if this setting is enabled, the page ratio of the original image will be retained when entering the new size."</seg>
<seg id="636">"regularity: [0, 100]: this parameter concerns larger structures. the higher this value is set, the more it is smoothed. this is necessary when there is a lot of noise, since it is then difficult to estimate the geometry of the picture. even if you want to create a 'van Gogh' turbulence effect, it must be set higher than 3."</seg>

<seg id="640">"cutting a photo is not just a frequently performed operation, but also a frequently underestimated tool to create a picture. image editing allows this very easy. to cut a photo you just need to create a rectangle with the mouse, by pressing the mouse button and dragging the rectangle, then you will see this rectangle then while you move the mouse."</seg>
<seg id="641">"you can change the size of the area to be cut by drawing at the corners of the rectangle, creating a new rectangle by simply pulling it with the left mouse button."</seg>

<seg id="644">"in the tool Follow aspect ratio, you can specify the orientation as portrait or landscape format. in portrait mode, the greater value of the height and the transverse format of the width is assigned."</seg>
<seg id="645">"the tool Follow aspect ratio uses a relative aspect ratio. this means that it is always the same regardless of whether you use centimeter, inches or any other physical size. you can, for example, see a list of traditional sizes for photo paper and their aspect ratio."</seg>
<seg id="646">"at the right end of the dialog, two buttons exist to automatically center the selection horizontally or vertically."</seg>
<seg id="647">"in the bottom of the dialog you can set the range for cutting to the greatest possible, depending on the chosen ratio and orientation."</seg>
<seg id="648">"the tool Follow aspect ratio saves its settings depending on the image orientation (Horizontal or Vertical). if you use the cutting tool next time, these settings are stored as default values depending on orientation. the modified image dimensions are stored in the EXIF data, so that the EXIF data reflect the cut image and not the original image."</seg>
<seg id="649">"the setup aid settings allow you to hide Help, so that you can better assemble your pictures. these aids are:"</seg>
<seg id="650">"harmonic triangle: harmonic dividends are based on the principle of similarity. like the third elbow, harmonic triangles are a possibility to divide a rectangle into similarly harmonic triangles aligned on the diagonal."</seg>
<seg id="651">"golden mean: the golden center is a division that is based on different natural growth patterns, such as the spirals of a Nautilus pussy or the flower leaves of a sunflower. it appears in all kinds of things that we feel as beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="652">"the golden partition is the irrational number 1,618033988... and it was used by ancient Egyptians and Greeks used to create your temples and pyramids. artists and architects have used the golden partition in all times when you put your pictures, buildings and even photos together to give your creations a natural order and beauty."</seg>
<seg id="653">"the number is derived from Fibonacci sequence 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34 & etc. the resulting divider is 1: 1.618 the golden mean."</seg>
<seg id="654">The golden center provides smoother relief lines if you put a picture together. these aids are listed below:</seg>
<seg id="655">"the Golden Spirale will bring you good results for your photos. compared to the third elbow, the golden spiral creates a liquid line that can follow the eye through the image. this kind of composition takes the gaze of the viewer along the line of the spiral and creates a symmetric visual flow in this way."</seg>
<seg id="656">"a further rule is called the rectangles of the golden spiral, also called golden rectangles. these rectangles are used to create the golden spiral."</seg>
<seg id="657">"the golden triangles also derive from the above-discussed golden spiral. their vertices are the center points of the sides of the golden rectangles. note that, in contrast to harmonious triangles, golden triangles are not equal triangles. diagonals on these lines can cause a static object to appear more dynamic."</seg>
<seg id="658">"if you use golden triangles to break your frame, create an effect that is called dynamic symmetry by professional photographers. try to place your image focus on one of the intersection points and other visual information in the triangles. the result is a very attractive composition that you cannot achieve otherwise."</seg>
<seg id="659">The Options Horizontal mirror and mirror vertical mirror can be used to mirror the harmonic divider.</seg>
<seg id="660">"with the button color you can set the color of the guides. if you have a picture with many colors and a high contrast, the guides can be invisible. in this way, you can adjust the color of the lines to your current image."</seg>
<seg id="661">The free rotation is a tool to rotate an image at any angle.</seg>
<seg id="662">"if you make a photo, it easily happens that you do not hold the camera vertically or horizontally. this creates a picture in which things are turned around an angle. you can do this by editing free rotation and adjust the target angle."</seg>
<seg id="663">Rotate your image with the slider angle. the values on this slider are in degrees. with the Preferences button you can set the slider to 0 degrees. a preview of the rotation is available on the right side of the window. the new dimensions of the image are shown on the top right.</seg>
<seg id="664">"for your help, the Free Rotation module provides a horizontal and vertical line. move the mouse cursor in the image preview to position the two lines. after moving it over an important point of the image, you can fix it with a pressure on the left mouse button. now adjust the angle as described in previous section."</seg>
<seg id="665">After you have turned a picture you will find unwanted triangular holes in the corners. one way to repair it is to use the function Transforming cut out of the image processing.</seg>
<seg id="666">An elegant way to cut the image is the Automatic Cut. select one of the following options:</seg>
<seg id="667">"the Anti-Aliasing option smoothes the image a bit after the turn. however, note the above warning."</seg>
<seg id="668">All perspective transformations are performed around a fixed point of the so-called reference point. this point is in the middle of the picture and is represented by a red circle.</seg>
<seg id="669">To change the perspective you need to use the red squares at the corners of your image. the preview will then be automatically recalculated. on the right side of the dialog you will find some information that will help you change the perspective:</seg>

<seg id="675">Angle to the right: shows the current angle in degrees at the bottom right corner of the transformed area.</seg>
<seg id="676">"after adjusting the perspective, the image becomes a little blurred. for a single adjustment, this effect is small, but two adaptations generate a double so strong effect and you should avoid this if possible."</seg>
<seg id="677">"after you have adjusted the perspective, you get unpleasant triangular holes at the corners. one way to clean it is to cut the picture with transformation cutting from the image editing."</seg>
<seg id="678">"a horizontal shear, for example, will shift the upper part of the picture to the right and the lower part to the left. this is not rotation, the picture is distorted."</seg>
<seg id="679">"rotate your image by using the horizontal angle and vertical angle. you can shear horizontally and vertically at the same time. if you press presets, the angle will be reset to zero. a preview of the effect will be displayed and the new dimensions of the target image are displayed on the right of the thumbnail."</seg>

<seg id="683">"& digicam; requires a number of libraries and other packages to read and write image formats. the available formats are therefore dependent on your system and, in some cases, of the way these libraries have been compiled. in most distributions you will be able to edit a large number of image formats."</seg>

<seg id="1046">"if you choose the first method, POV-Ray monitors a beam per pixel. if the difference between the color values to the adjacent pixels exceeds the given threshold, a grid of 4x4 additional points will be calculated, with a depth value of 5 then 5x5 (25) additional rays per pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1047">"the difference between two pixels is calculated as follows: r 1, g 1 and b 1 are the values for red, green and blue of the first pixel, r 2, g 2 and b 2 are the values for red, green and blue of the second pixel."</seg>
<seg id="1048">Diff = abs (r. 1 -r 2) + abs (g 1 -g 2) + abs (b 1 -b 2)</seg>

<seg id="1665">"please note that here the term drum patch is meant to represent another percussionist instrument (drum, cymbal, maracas & etc;) and not the one with which the sound means the pitch of the same drum (as some keyboards have)."</seg>
<seg id="1666">The keymap section is used to indicate how sounds are mapped on a particular channel or instrument. the use is:</seg>
<seg id="1667">"as with the PATCHMAP section, the sequence of rows is very important, as is the presence. so you have to create 128 entries."</seg>
<seg id="1668">You can define several keymaps for each channel and instrument. you only have to use different names in the first row.</seg>
<seg id="1669">Keymaps are used mainly to map sounds to the percussions channel. take a look at the included keymaps.</seg>
<seg id="1670">"this section can be used to map some channels to others. for example, if you want to exchange the first and second channel, just make it in the CHANNELMAP section."</seg>
<seg id="1671">"however, these settings are useful for keyboards which have the percussion on a particular channel (General MIDI on Channel 10, others need the channels 16 or 9)."</seg>
<seg id="1672">"MIDI devices need 16 channels, the CHANNELMAP section has 16 lines, numbered from 0 to 15, based on the following pattern:"</seg>
<seg id="1673">"if you use the keymap option, the keymap will need to be defined further forward in the file. if you use the ForcePatch option, all events will be ignored to change the patch on that channel. in this case, patch x will always be used."</seg>
<seg id="1674">"the ForcePatch option can, for example, be useful to always use the percussions-patch on the percussion channel."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"the value for PitchBenderRatio indicates in which ratio pitch-Bender events are multiplied. so, if a MIDI file sends a pitch-Bender event with the value n, it is converted with the formula n * (r / 4096) and then redirected. the value 4096 is used so that in the map file there are no decimal commands."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"this setting is needed because GM specifies that a keyboard that gets a pitch-bender event with the value 4096 to play a sound higher. unfortunately, some keyboards are trying to play two notes up to one octave higher. to find the right value on your keyboard, you need to try a bit with & kmid."</seg>
<seg id="1677">"to use a MIDI map, simply open the MIDI settings dialog."</seg>
<seg id="1678">The channel view is a window with a whole series of pianos (one for each MIDI channel). on these keyboards you see what sounds are being played.</seg>
<seg id="1679">"you can also use the channel view to change the instrument on a particular channel. for each channel there is a drop-down list where you can select an instrument. if you have changed an instrument, the button lights no longer green but red to indicate that no longer the original instrument is used."</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the channel view has (until now) two different views to display the played sounds. in the View menu, select the Settings menu under the channel view:"</seg>
<seg id="1681">"the speed LCD shows the speed with which a song is played. the higher the number, the greater the speed."</seg>
<seg id="1682">"you can change the tempo of a song. for example, if you find a song too fast to follow the text, you can slow down it. to change the tempo, use the arrows on the left and right of the LCD."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"a MIDI file is a file that contains information about how to play a piece of music. it contains the notes, rhythm, speed, & etc;. thus, the same MIDI file can perform on two different devices at very different results, just as two different musicians can play the same notes in very different ways."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"but a typical MIDI file needs about 50 KB, while an mp3 file needs 4 MB (a compression ratio of 1: 80) and with a good synthesizer you get a similar sound quality."</seg>
<seg id="1685">"this can happen if you have a binary distribution (rpm, deb) by & kmid; this happens because & kmid; without AWE support was compiled. to eliminate the problem, you need to download and install a source distribution (e.g. from kmid; 's start page)"</seg>

<seg id="2030">First you need to specify the name of the script and the interpreter. example: SH / home / myHome / myScript.sh.</seg>
<seg id="2031">Although qualified paths are allowed it is recommended to use the% scriptdir variable in command line such as sh% scriptdir / myScript.sh.

<seg id="2032">"% f: we will replace the current document with the URL of the current document. in case of a local document, file: / from the document name will be removed."</seg>
<seg id="2033">"% pid: is replaced with the PID of the current & quantaplus. if by & quantaplus, only one instance is running, the text is unique to the PID number. this is useful when DCOP is used to control & quantaplus, which is used by the external script."</seg>

<seg id="2037">"the output of the executed application can also be redirected. there are two types of output: normal output, written to the standard output. it can be specified what to do with the text written to the standard output by the value of the output field output:"</seg>
<seg id="2038">"if there are many tags in the markup language, it is recommended to subdivide the tags into logical groups. it is necessary for each group to create their own toolbar. in the given case, there are not too many, therefore one can create a toolbar with the name of the markup."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"once a toolbar is added, you need to add and configure actions. select Preferences."</seg>
<seg id="2040">The parts of this window are pretty self explanatory. press the New Action button at the bottom of the window starts editing mode.</seg>

<seg id="2042">"complete everything and, if the tag has attributes and you plan their use, enable" "Edit Tag" "dialog when available, so that an input is possible when using the action."</seg>
<seg id="2043">Igitt! is this an ugly symbol. who should remember the action in conjunction with this symbol? let's replace it before we have difficulty.</seg>

<seg id="2047">"with regard to the start of the day, I decided to create a start button as a symbol. by using green (green is usually displayed as loose, rigid, further interpreted), or at least, a message to the user is signalled that clicking this symbol is a & lt; startles; tag in the current document will be inserted."</seg>
<seg id="2048">"after creating the symbol it must still be connected with the action. this is done via the menu with settings actions... (in & quantaplus,) and selection of desired action. besides the text field there is a button, press it."</seg>

<seg id="2051">Let's assume you want to add some common & quantaplus; -functions to the toolbar or it should be shared to a better overview by some separators into several groups. open the tool bar to set dialog on Settings tool bars. make sure that the desired toolbar is selected.</seg>
<seg id="2052">"after selecting the element to be added to the toolbar, press the arrow button to the right. this adds the item to the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2053">"for example, I would like to have a quick way to access the Konqueror preview. I will select it and add it to the toolbar."</seg>
<seg id="2054">Please note how the separators support grouping. someone who does not know my toolbar might believe that the & konqueror; -button is the opposite of the start button.</seg>
<seg id="2055">The new toolbar must be tested by halving all symbols to ensure that everything works.</seg>
<seg id="2056">"after New eXML does not exist, it will be created in the root folder, but your toolbar (s) should be stored in the correct folder. please adjust your toolbar (s) when a file is opened by the corresponding type."</seg>
<seg id="2057">"perhaps the most notable expansion of & quantaplus, for the normal user is the ability to add documentation for the scripting language or the formatting language that you like most. this is why this chapter describes how I create a & PHP; documentation tree for my personal use."</seg>
<seg id="2058">"before starting your own documentation, you could check in the & quantaplus, repository whether someone has already done that for you."</seg>
<seg id="2059">"there are two parts in this process. first, you need to create an existing documentation for the formatting / script / etc; then you need to create the docrc file."</seg>
<seg id="2060">"# KDE configuration file [Tree] Doc dir = path, relative to this file, for documentation HTML files e.g. php42 / # elements in the main index Top Element = Section1.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.html Sec2.3 = Sec2.html tag 2 = tag.html tag2 = tag.html tag3 = tag.html tag3 = tag.html"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"the tree section defines the visible part of the documentation in the documentation tree. for example, see the & PHP documentation for example:"</seg>
<seg id="2062">"# KDE Config file [Tree] Doc dir = php42 / # top level element element = PHP 4.2 documentation PHP 4.2 documentation = index of content, # Getting Started, # Language Reference Table of Contents = index.html Getting Started = Introduction = language.basic-syntac.html..."</seg>
<seg id="2063">Note the # before Getting Started and Language Reference. this indicates that it is a subfolder in the tree with its own content. there is no known limit for the depth of the box (except by reason) mdash; but try it yourself.</seg>
<seg id="2064">You notice that the table of contents is referenced directly to a file (and conveniently located at the top end of the tree view & mdash; folder is shown!).</seg>
<seg id="2065">Spaces affect nothing but pay attention to & lt; characters. these should be replaced by & amp; & lt; in all & XML; -based & quantaplus. resources are replaced.</seg>
<seg id="2066">"the content section is the area of the docrc file, which is used to shape the context sensitive help. for example, when writing a & PHP; script the documentation for the mysql _ fetch _ array function would appear. there are only two types of entries here: the context list (context list) and the file connection lines."</seg>
<seg id="2067">A simple list of contextual elements that should be available (for & PHP; these are the functions of & PHP;).</seg>
<seg id="2068">Now you can easily save your file docrc and after $HOME / .kde / share / apps / Quanta / doc / Quanta / doc for local and global use. then create a folder (like you specified it in your file docrc) in the same folder as docrc and copy your HTML documentation to it.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"if you are sure that these are good and worthy to be shared, send your docrc files with a description of important information, such as which documentation were used to the & quantaplus, community. they will not be rich, but be proud to have collaborated with the best web development platform."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"with & quantaplus, you are not alone. it is possible to share the separable resources (DTEP packages, toolbars with actions, scripts, templates) with others. there are two ways to do this:"</seg>
<seg id="2071">"the resources can be sent by email to friends, partners or anyone else. in different places there is an email-sending menu entry, such as the DTD DTD package (DTEP), sending email, toolbar toolbar with email, in the context menu of files and folders in the template and in the scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"the resources can be uploaded into our main archive, from where all other and quantaplus users can download it. the contributions will be checked and only made available if our team needs them as correct and useful for the publication. in order to make an online contribution, the source of resources is guaranteed, both for our team and for the later users."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"when uploading you will be asked for your personal GPG key after your passphrase (the passphrase is not saved), or in the event that you have several keys, you can select one. in the dialog New Resource, the input fields must be filled (URL preview can remain empty) and click OK to start loading."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"upload can be uploaded from the DTD DTD Package (DTEP) menus, upload tool bar toolbar, and start in the context menu of files and folders in templates and scripts tree."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"after downloading a resource, still before installation, examines & quantaplus, the integrity of the resource by checking the integrity and signing. in case of problems, it warns and it can then be canceled. please note the warning messages carefully. if integrity is given and the resource is signed correctly, a message appears with the specification of the source of the resource."</seg>
<seg id="2076">"it is possible to work in XML languages currently not yet by & quantaplus. however, the creation can be time-consuming because hundreds of tag files could be needed in tagXML format. there is the simpler way to convert a DTD into a DTEP package automatically."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"the conversion can be started from the DTD loading and converting a DTD. select the .dtd file with the DTD description, which should be used. after that, the following dialog appears:"</seg>

<seg id="2082">"in & quantaplus, the working area is divided into three areas: global, local and project-related. this distinction concerns a number of components in & quantaplus."</seg>
<seg id="2083">"global elements are stored for anyone who uses & quantaplus, which is stored in the shared folder structure of & quantaplus, which enables administrators to secure various tool bars, actions and patterns in the global tree, which will then be available to everyone in a multi-user environment on the system."</seg>
<seg id="2084">Local elements represent a personal collection of web development tools for a single user. these are user-specific patterns and toolbars. local elements are stored in the user directory so that they can only use this user personally.</seg>
<seg id="2085">Project-related elements are only available within a particular project. this can be anything from & CSS; patterns to toolbars with special actions specifically for the files of a particular project. simply said this is the most restricted size. all elements are stored in the folder tree of the project which emits the common use of special tools and patterns from all employees within the project.</seg>
<seg id="2086">"the & quantaplus; -MDI; consists of several main areas: the editor window, the construction-view, the cartons with information and the tool bars."</seg>
<seg id="2087">"you can click the box flag with the right mouse button to get a context menu with the current document, such as the current, other or all card riders, reload, delete or upload the document, skip to a bookmark or run CVS instructions on the current document."</seg>

<seg id="2089">"at the top end of the editor window, the toolbars of the editor are located. currently, & quantaplus, & HTML; 4.01 Transitional is a standard for which a set of toolbars is displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"the use of toolbars is really easy. if you want to insert a single tag, e.g. & lt; in your document, then click on the icon representing the tag. now you can enter the data for this just added tag. if you want to insert a tag that has several attributes (such as anchor), you can fill in a dialog different fields."</seg>

<seg id="2094">"templates can be divided into three categories depending on which context they are used. global templates are always available, local templates are always available, local templates are available only for the relevant user and templates in projects are only usable in the project."</seg>

<seg id="2281">There are many graphical tools to compare. why so & kward 3;? let me briefly explain why I wrote.</seg>
<seg id="2282">"the merge was very complicated, because one of the contributors made many changes and at the same time had corrected the indentation at many places. another programmer had changed a lot of text in the same file. the result was numerous conflicts in merging."</seg>
<seg id="2283">"the program used by me showed me only the changed lines, but I could not see what had changed within these lines. and there was no indication of the places where perhaps only the indentation had changed. merging these changes was a small nightmare."</seg>
<seg id="2284">This was the beginning. the first version of & kdiff3; could represent differences within a line and changes to white characters. later a lot of other useful functions were added.</seg>
<seg id="2285">"for example, if you want to compare text quickly, simply copy it to the clipboard and paste it into one of the comparison window."</seg>
<seg id="2286">A function that made a lot of work was the comparing and merging of folders. this function turned & kward 3; almost into a full-fledged file browser.</seg>
<seg id="2287">This is useful when two people work independently of each other on a piece of code and make changes. the merge editor below the differences windows allows to resolve conflicts and at the same time display the expected result. this editor allows you to edit the result even directly. the screenshot shows three source files when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2288">& kdiff3; also helps you compare and merge complete folders. this screenshot shows & kdiff3; when merging:</seg>
<seg id="2289">"& kdiff3; displays the exact differences and is based on the possibilities of today's color monitors. if you often need to check codes, you will like this function."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"differences in white signs and tabs are displayed visible. if lines only differ in a certain number of white signs, one can see at a glance at the summary in the column on the left side. (no more trouble if somebody changes the indentation.)"</seg>
<seg id="2291">"if a file is the same and the other is different in one line, the color indicates which file is different. red color means that both are different."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"if all files have the same name but are in different folders, then you can make the typing work easier by just writing the file name of the first file completely. example:"</seg>
<seg id="2293">"diff3 folder 1 folder, folder 2 folder, folder 2 folder, folder 2 folder folder, folder 2 folder folder, folder 2 folder folder"</seg>
<seg id="2294">"opening dialog allows manually typing file names, selecting the file browser (file...) or selecting a recently opened file from the drop-down list."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"using the Folder button... you can also select a folder. if you select a folder, the comparisons or merging of folders will be initiated. if a file is selected for A, however, a folder will be used for B and C, then use & kdiff3; the file name from A in the other two folders."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"if merging is enabled, the input field is active for the target and can be edited. however, it is not necessary to immediately specify an output file. you can also do this step later when saving."</seg>
<seg id="2297">The Configuration button opens a dialog with settings. you can set options here before you start merging / merging.</seg>
<seg id="2298">"sometimes you don't want to compare a whole file, but only parts of a text. & kdiff3; allows you to drag text parts from the clipboard into the active comparison window. in the opening dialog you do not need to select files, you can simply close the dialog with the Cancel button."</seg>
<seg id="2299">You can also use drag and drop: just drag a file from a file manager or select text from an editor and drop it over a comparison window.</seg>
<seg id="2300">"sometimes a file contains several similar functions. if you want to find out how similar these functions are, it would be a relatively big effort. you would need to create two corresponding files, upload them and then compare them. now you can simply copy, paste and then compare the relevant sections."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"note: currently, you can't extract anything from & kdiff3; only dropping text into a comparison window is supported."</seg>
<seg id="2302">Warning: some editors interpret pulling and dropping text into another program as cutting and pasting (instead of copying and pasting). in such a case your original data could be lost.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"the info line of the source pane contains the characters A, B or C, the filename and the line number of the first visible line in the window. (note that window C is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (note that window C is optional.) Any info line has a different color. (note that window C is optional.)"</seg>
<seg id="2304">"the three source windows are assigned the letters A, B and C. A has the color blue, B the color green and C is magenta. (these preferences can be changed via the settings menu.)"</seg>
<seg id="2305">"when a difference is detected, you can see the color, which file is different. if both files differ, the default color for it is red. (color for conflicts in the settings). the color scheme is particularly useful when comparing three files. that's good in the next section."</seg>
<seg id="2306">"when differences are found, the column shows the corresponding color. in some programming languages where white characters are not so important, it is useful to see only the relevant changes. (at C / C + + e.g. white characters are only relevant in strings and comments, for the preprocessor and in few, rare cases.)"</seg>
<seg id="2307">"the vertical line separating the merge column from the text is interrupted at the places where the respective source file has no lines. if the line breaks are activated, the line will be scored on a broken line."</seg>
<seg id="2308">"the result window (below the comparison windows) also has an info line with the wording output:, the filename and [Tab] if you edited the result. usually it contains text by automatic merging, but often it also contains conflicts."</seg>
<seg id="2309">!!! until all conflicts are resolved the saving is deactivated!!! (use the buttons Springe to the next solved / unresolved conflict to find the remaining conflicts.)</seg>
<seg id="2310">"if only two comparators are used, each difference must be solved at the same time a conflict which has to be solved manually."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"by clicking with the left mouse button in the merge column in one of the windows, the group belonging to the row will be displayed in all windows and the first line of the group will be displayed."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"sometimes there is no more line left in the group by automatic merging, or by manual editing; this is only a placeholder in the case that you change your mind, and perhaps select another source. this text will not appear in the final saved file, nor in a selection you may want to copy and paste elsewhere."</seg>
<seg id="2313">"the text & lt; merge conflicted; however, appears in the clipboard when you copy such text from the result window. be careful with this function."</seg>
<seg id="2314">"note: when selecting the sources ignore the options numbers or ignore Ignoramere C / C + + comments, changes in numbers or comments are also treated as white characters."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"navigating is mainly used with the scroll bars and the mouse, but you can also use the keyboard. if you click in one of the windows, you can use the arrow keys on the left, right, up, side up, page, beginning, end, string beginning and string end, see how you can also use it from other programs."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"in the dispensing window, you can also use the other buttons to edit. using the Insert button, you can switch between insert and overwrite mode. (default is the insert mode.)"</seg>
<seg id="2317">One click with the left mouse button in one of the merge columns synchronizes the view of all windows to the beginning of each group (as already explained in the merging and the editable output window).</seg>
<seg id="2318">"the toolbar contains seven buttons for navigation with which you can jump to the current / first / last difference, to the next / previous difference (Ctrl-bottom / Ctrl-Up), to the next / previous conflict (Ctrl-Picture Up / Ctrl-Picture Slide) or to the next / previous conflict."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"to copy the selection to the clipboard, press the Copy button (Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Insert). there is also the option selection automatically copy. if this is enabled, you automatically copy whatever you tick and copy the manual copy. be careful with this option, because you might like to overwrite the contents of the clipboard by mistake."</seg>
<seg id="2320">"line ends are saved according to the underlying operating system. Unix flavors use a newline character\, and Win32-based systems use cart return + line feed\\ r\. KDiff3 does not keep the line end of the source files, therefore you should not use binaries."</seg>
<seg id="2321">The options and the list of most recently used files will be saved automatically when they are finished and restored at the next start. (Menu Settings - &gt; KDiff3 set up...)</seg>
<seg id="2322">"select a font with fixed width. (on some systems, the dialog also provides fonts with variable width to choose from, but you should not use them.)"</seg>

<seg id="2330">"some editors (on some systems) save a cart return character '\\ r' and a newline '\' at the end of a line, others in turn save only a newline '\'."</seg>
<seg id="2331">"in the first part of the analysis, numbers and associated characters ('0' - '9', '.', '-') are ignored. in the result, the differences are still displayed, but they are treated as white marks."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"in default, this option is disabled. changes in comments are treated like changes in white characters."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"search intensively for even smaller differences. the option is enabled in default. it is effective in complex and large files, but slow with very large files."</seg>
<seg id="2334">"in automatic jump mode, this setting determines how long the result of the selection is displayed before the next unsolved conflict is skipped."</seg>
<seg id="2335">"automatically triggers all conflicts in white characters by using the selected file as source. (default is manual selection.) This is useful when white characters in many files are less important. if you only need this from time to time, then use the functions Select A / B / C for all unresolved white conflicts from the merge menu. note that the automatic selection also affects conflicts in numbers or comments when the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments."</seg>
<seg id="2336">These options are handled in the chapter on scanning folders and performing a merge. look for details under documentation to compare and merge.</seg>
<seg id="2337">"if a file is stored and already exists an older version, the original version will be appended to the suffix .org. if already such a backup file exists with the suffix .org, it will be deleted without further backup."</seg>
<seg id="2338">"adjust the language of the interface. changing this option does not affect the current running program. you need to exit and restart, so that the change becomes active. (this option is available in the KDE version of & kdiff3; not available because language is set there globally via the control center.)"</seg>
<seg id="2339">"the following encoding settings can be set for each entry separately. if enabled, the upper setting is used for all entries."</seg>
<seg id="2340">"in the selection fields for encoding, a short reference appears, which is the local encoding. (this cannot be changed here and has a purely informal character for you.)"</seg>
<seg id="2341">"adjust the file encoding for source files. this influences how special characters are treated and interpreted. since encoding for each file is individually configurable, even files with different coding can be compared and merged."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"if you have edited a file, you can specify which encoding is to be used for saving."</seg>
<seg id="2343">"if you define preprocessing commands, they might not work with your codec. (for example, your files may be 16 bit Unicode, but the pre-processing command can only deal with 8-bit ASCII.) With this option you can specify the encoding of output of preprocessor commands."</seg>
<seg id="2344">Turn off this to suppress highlighting changes in white characters in text or review columns. (note: this also applies to changes in numbers or comments if the options are ignored or ignore C / C + + comments.)</seg>
<seg id="2345">"this selection is only available if you compare three files. in normal mode, all differences are displayed in a color-coded oversight column. but sometimes you might want to see only the differences between two of three files."</seg>
<seg id="2346">Sometimes you want to use the available space on the screen rather for long lines. simply stop the less important windows. (this option is in the window menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2347">Arranges the comparison window by side or overlapping. this can also be useful for displaying long lines. (this option is in the Windows menu.)</seg>
<seg id="2348">"sometimes you see the differences and then decide suddenly to merge the files. a simple click starts merging and uses the file name of the last source file as default name for the output file. (if this function is used to restart the merge, then the name of the last used output file will be retained.)"</seg>
<seg id="2349">"when reading a file, it will first pass this external command. in & kward 3; then the output of the command is visible, and not the file itself. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"when reading a file, it will first pass this external command. if a normal pre-processing command is also specified (see above), then the output of the command is the input of this command. you can write your own preprocessor that matches your requirements. each input line must have a corresponding output line."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"the idea behind it is to allow users more flexibility when setting the diff results. however, an external program is required, and most users do not want to program it themselves. however, the good news is that in most cases sed or perl completely suffice."</seg>
<seg id="2352">"use this preprocessing command for newlines to convert the input into capital letters: SED's /\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\</seg>

<seg id="2354">While you experiment with sed you may start to understand it and maybe you may even like these regular expressions. they are very useful because there are many programs that support very similar things.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"ignoring numbers is actually an already built-in function in KDiff3. but it is good as an example of another preprocessing command for newlines. sed's / [0123456789.-] / / g 'Each sign between' [and ']' is a hit, and each hit is replaced by nothing, so quasi deleted."</seg>
<seg id="2356">Sometimes you may want to perform several replacements at one time. then you can use the semicolon ';' to separate the compositions. for example:</seg>
<seg id="2357">Instead of sed you can also use something else like perl -p -e's / RegExp / replacement / SCHALTER 'However there are some details different. where sed\\ (and\\) is needed perl only needs (and) without the leading'\\ '. example:</seg>

<seg id="2359">"note: in rare cases when using a normal preprocessor, the newline preprocessor sees the output of the normal preprocessor as input."</seg>
<seg id="2360">"preprocessor commands are very useful, but as with any function that changes text or hides differences, you may accidentally notice certain differences and destroy important data in the worst case."</seg>

<seg id="2956">"welcome to the & kde; System V Init Editor, rather known (and in the following also named) as & ksysv;. this section introduces a few concepts and describes what you can do with & ksysv."</seg>
<seg id="2957">"system V Init is rapidly becoming the standard for the control of program starts when it comes to running the system in the & Linux world. this is because it is easier to use, more powerful and at the same time more flexible than the traditional BSD init."</seg>
<seg id="2958">I will not go further on historical aspects here (e.g. because I don't know about it myself: -).</seg>
<seg id="2959">"the init binary file is under / sbin and not under / etc. this is important because maybe someone might try to convert a machine to System V Init, without making a re-installation and re-formatting. Linux; kernel looks first under / etc after an init file. therefore, you must ensure that the old init was removed from there if there was one."</seg>
<seg id="2960">"the SysV Init differs also from the BSD init that the configuration files are located in a subfolder of / etc instead of directly in / etc. this folder is named rc.sysit, and the following additional folders:"</seg>
<seg id="2961">"system services include such things as network, NFS, & Sendmail;, httpd & etc; system services do not include such things as setserial, which is only started once. such calls belong to rc.local."</seg>
<seg id="2962">"for your part, rc.local should be in / etc / rc.d if you need it. most systems have this file, even if there is not much use for it. you can also set up rc.serial in / etc / rc.d if you want to do something with the serial port."</seg>
<seg id="2963">The kernel looks init at different places after the program and starts the first one he finds.</seg>
<seg id="2964">The default runlevel is in / etc / inittab. you should see in the beginning area a line like the following:</seg>
<seg id="2965">"at this point you can take a look into the second column and probably state that the default runlevel is 3. if you want to change it, then you can edit / etc / inittab manually and change the 3. if you have a bit messed up, then you will be able to repair it by reboot the system and run the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2966">"but how does it start all the correct scripts? if you type ls -l in rc3.d, then you will probably see something like the following:"</seg>
<seg id="2967">"you will notice that in this folder there are no correct files. instead, each entry is a link to one of the scripts in the init.d directory."</seg>
<seg id="2968">How to start and stop init actually system services? quite simple: each of the scripts is written in such a way that it accepts an argument as start and stop. you can actually start these scripts by hand on the command line as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2969">"this would stop the httpd server. init reads the name, and if it contains a K, the script will be called with the argument stop. if it contains an S, the script will be called with the start argument."</seg>
<seg id="2970">"some people want a simple way to set up machines for many purposes. I could have a server running level running only httpd, & Sendmail;, Network & etc;, Network & etc;, Network & etc."</seg>
<seg id="2971">Here you will learn how to use & sysv; it should not be very difficult because the program was created as user-friendly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="2972">The use of & ksysv; with a mouse or another pointing device is easy to not say trivial: simply drag an entry from the range of available system services to one of the six running level to start (or stop) at this level.</seg>
<seg id="2973">"you can also move scripts between Runlevel, or change the position within a level by setting it somewhere else. this will only happen if you pull out an entry from the range of available system services."</seg>
<seg id="2974">"note: entries are moved when you move them to a new area. to simply copy them to a new runlevel, you must explicitly copy from the Edit menu or from the context menu and paste it into the target area -- even if the same entry already exists in the target area of the action."</seg>
<seg id="2975">"the sorting number of an entry can sometimes not be calculated. in such a case, you must edit the sorting numbers of the surrounding entries before you can try again to insert the system service."</seg>
<seg id="2976">Note: there is no way to restore entries that were thrown into the recycle bin. so be careful.</seg>
<seg id="2977">"you can use the tabulator button to activate the different working areas (available system services, Runlevel 1 Start, Runlevel 1 Stop & etc;) as well as the cursor keys to make a selection above or below the previous one."</seg>
<seg id="2978">"to move an entry to another runlevel, move it with cut into the clipboard (you can also use Ctrl; X) and add it to the desired runlevel (with Ctrl; V)."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"to change the sorting number or the name of an entry manually, press the input button to change the properties dialog. use the Tab button to change the properties dialog. close the dialog by pressing the input button to accept the changes, or press Esc to discard the changes."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"because of the risk of data loss, all entries in the File menu require a confirmation before they are executed."</seg>
<seg id="2981">All settings are stored in $KDEHOME / share / config / ksysvrc. preferences are taken from the global file ($KDEDIR / share / config / ksysvrc) if available. otherwise they will be restored by & ksysv; changes to the default settings are stored in a local ksysvrc.</seg>
