&quot; although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012 , I would live there for the first time now . &quot;
and that was very exciting for me .
my love for America is extraordinarily great .
&quot; like many of my generation I grew up with American movies , danced to American music , read American authors and run his sport . &quot;
&quot; in fact , this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film . &quot;
&quot; as a 14 @-@ year @-@ old I saw the great D@@ enz@@ el Washington , as he played Gra@@ y Gran@@ th@@ am in The Peli@@ can Let@@ ter , a fear@@ less re@@ porter who , with the help of Julia Rober@@ ts , covered the mur@@ der@@ ous plot of an oil magn@@ ate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were interested in his interest . &quot;
I was caught .
&quot; free to Method Man , &quot; I was it , as if this is the absolute truth , forget everything else , that &apos;s what I want to do with my life . &quot;
&quot; and the year I was living in Arizona , my admir@@ ation for the USA only intensified . &quot;
&quot; I always said : &quot; America is the only country in which I have ever lived , whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
I even had written a very fan@@ ati@@ cal love letter about his size .
then Donald Tru@@ mp came .
much has been written about the x@@ en@@ opho@@ bia and racism of this man .
the most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how to deal with his narrow @-@ min@@ de@@ dness .
&quot; in his opinion , he never stops behind the mountain as it is said so nicely . &quot;
&quot; he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it , and openly declares his contemp@@ t for Muslims , Lat@@ inos , African Americans and women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , people responded to his statements and voted in multi@@ tudes for him . &quot;
&quot; the 13 million votes he won in the Republi@@ can elections , was the highest number ever reached by a candidate nominated by the party . &quot;
I was spe@@ ech@@ less .
&quot; who are the Americans who support this big@@ ot@@ ry person , I asked myself ? &quot;
I couldn &apos;t reconci@@ le Tru@@ mp and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time .
&quot; like my professor , Dr. Bill Sil@@ cock , Director of the Journ@@ alism Program , which receives people from all over the world , a deep believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mps &apos;s view of the world did not agree with that of Peter Bh@@ ati@@ a , the current editor of the C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati Inqu@@ ir@@ er . &quot;
Bh@@ ati@@ a and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the &quot; Phoenix S@@ uns . &quot;
&quot; tru@@ mp intoler@@ ance is also in contrast to the gener@@ osity I experienced at Sand@@ y B@@ ahr , who fought the environment for her life and her husband Dave , my host family , who treated me like her son . &quot;
she still goes to the engagement of Krist@@ i Kapp@@ es who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the comple@@ xi@@ ties of American life .
&quot; then there were Andrew goo@@ ey , Kath@@ r@@ yn Mc@@ Man@@ us and Re@@ tha Hill , my ment@@ ors , whose wise counsel helped me much with my career . &quot;
these people and the values em@@ bodied by them deep@@ ened my love for America .
&quot; while Tru@@ mp warned his way to the nominated republi@@ can presidential candidate , they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America . &quot;
but it turned out that they were the exception of the rule .
&quot; on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans , mostly White , gave the presi@@ dency to a man , despite - or perhaps just because of his contemp@@ t against non @-@ white people . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Tru@@ mp because they either shared his racism and fan@@ ati@@ cism , or because they were willing to over@@ look these things , almost broke my heart . &quot;
perhaps it is unfair to design@@ ate the Tru@@ mp voters as ra@@ cists .
&quot; to categ@@ ori@@ ze people , said one of my friends , is exactly what led us to this situation . &quot;
this is superficial and dis@@ respect@@ ful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in another way .
it shows people that their concerns and fears about the hec@@ tic changes in their communities are not taken into account .
&quot; could it be that these voters , most of whom know , voted for Tru@@ mp because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them ? &quot;
&quot; in other words , they might say they are still important in this America ? &quot;
perhaps .
&quot; however , one can hardly forget the words of David Rem@@ nick , who commented on the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks down with contemp@@ t for those who look different from him . &quot;
&quot; this &quot; Whit@@ el@@ ash &quot; ( O@@ B ) : as much as &quot; &quot; rebellion of the wh@@ ites against all other eth@@ ni@@ cities &quot; &quot; ; word play from white in reference to the wh@@ ites and whi@@ pl@@ ash , as the great Van Jones mentioned , has exactly killed what America has done so magni@@ fi@@ cent@@ ly . &quot;
&quot; millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality , it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background one likes , America welcomes everyone . &quot;
&quot; for this country chose as its president , twice the son of a Ken@@ y@@ ani , whose history , as he himself says , would not be possible anywhere else in the world . &quot;
&quot; with the election of Donald Tru@@ mp , however , there is a huge part of the White America &apos;s promise of this promise and says : to hell with diversity , freedom of religion and the whole concept of pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm , they say . &quot;
&quot; with all this I have to think of K@@ hi@@ z@@ r Khan , the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq , and what he said on the eve of the election . &quot;
&quot; on a rally for H@@ illary Clinton , Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd . &quot;
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp , my son , captain Hu@@ may@@ un K@@ ahn , would have a place in your America ? &quot; &quot; asked Mr. Khan . &quot;
the crowd responded with a loud &quot; No ! &quot;
&quot; would Muslims have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; no ! &quot; &quot; the crowd ro@@ ared . &quot;
&quot; have Lat@@ inos a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they answered .
have A@@ fr@@ o @-@ Americans have a place in your America ? &quot;
&quot; no ! &quot; they cried , and their voices cried lou@@ der . &quot;
&quot; if someone , who is not like you , would have a place in your America ? &quot;
he received a unanim@@ ous and loud &quot; NO &quot; !
&quot; Mr. Khan concluded with the words : &quot; thank God , Mr. Tru@@ mp , is this not your America . &quot; 36 hours later he was corrected . &quot;
&quot; the land for which his son had fallen , sent him a message . &quot;
&quot; this is Tru@@ mp Land now , said the message . &quot;
&quot; and all the people who look like Mr. Khan , could not find a place in this new America . &quot;
and this breaks my heart .

from misery to the stars : these Latin American children don &apos;t spoil their love for music by tr@@ ash

what has the Mexican music school of the Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero Community in the province of O@@ ax@@ aca with the children of the Paragu@@ ay@@ an city of C@@ ate@@ ura together ?
&quot; the music played in both places not only changed the lives of children , but also a very close connection with ... &quot;
music that lives with the waste
&quot; Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero is located on the edge of a large land@@ fill , only 16 Kilomet@@ ers south of O@@ ax@@ aca &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -@@ but worlds apart from the nearby pre @-@ Colum@@ bian ruins and its world @-@ famous cuisine . &quot;
&quot; for some years now , La b@@ anda de M@@ Ãº@@ sica ( Musik@@ ban@@ de ) has been playing in the community : a symph@@ ony orchestra consisting of children and adults , which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty . &quot;
a music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero in O@@ ax@@ aca .
the Guardian wrote about this project :
&quot; the community , located in one of the poor@@ est provinces of Mexico , is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence . &quot;
but this changed after a coinci@@ dental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope .
&quot; the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously , writes the local press Not@@ ici@@ as O@@ ax@@ aca N@@ VI : &quot;
&quot; as soon as they come from school , they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the du@@ sty streets to pursue their great passion . &quot;
&quot; you always come laugh@@ ing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet , tro@@ mb@@ one , Pic@@ col@@ o , clarinet , obo@@ e , flute , Wald@@ horn , Pau@@ ke , Bon@@ gos and the Con@@ ga to play . &quot;
music from Gar@@ bage
&quot; more than 7@@ ,000 kilometres south of Vic@@ ente Gu@@ err@@ ero play the children of C@@ ate@@ ura - a village that is practically located at the top of the largest garbage dump of As@@ unci@@ Ã³n in Paraguay &apos;s capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material : &quot;
&quot; music with re@@ manufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials , made in a workshop for musical instruments in C@@ ate@@ ura , where the recycl@@ ers under the direction of F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡@@ vez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments . &quot;
&quot; the instruments im@@ itate viol@@ ins , viol@@ as , cel@@ los , double bass , guitars , fl@@ utes , sax@@ oph@@ ones , trump@@ ets , tro@@ mb@@ ones and drums , all of which were made out of tr@@ ash . &quot;
&quot; the repertoire includes classical music , folk music , Paragu@@ ay@@ an and Latin American music , as well as music of the Beat@@ les , by Frank Sin@@ atra etc . &quot;
&quot; in an article from the Los Angeles Times , F@@ avi@@ o ChÃ¡@@ vez , a local ec@@ ologist and music teacher of the children of C@@ ate@@ ura , recalls the early days : &quot;
&quot; first it was very difficult , because we had no room for rehear@@ sals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in rub@@ b@@ ish . children didn &apos;t know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children . &quot;
this changed as F@@ avi@@ o something he had never seen before : a violin produced from waste .
&quot; today , there is an entire orchestra , which plays on instruments of re@@ processed material and is called The Recycl@@ ed Orchestra . &quot;
a documentation called &quot; Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic &quot; ( Harmon@@ ic garbage dump ) records the musical performance :
the world generates about one billion tons of rub@@ b@@ ish each year .
&quot; those who live with him and from him are the poor@@ est , like the people in C@@ ate@@ ura , Paraguay . &quot;
and here they turn him into something beautiful .
Land@@ fill Harmon@@ ic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of tr@@ ash @-@ to @-@ music around the world .
the orchestra even played his music before Pope Francis :
these East African countries show how technology and team@@ work can successfully combat illegal fishing
photo Â© F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing .
&quot; this post , written by Emma Br@@ yce , was originally published at En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine specifically about international , practical solutions for environmental issues . &quot;
the re @-@ release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Vo@@ ices for the common use of content .
&quot; in West Africa , it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia waters before it visited the other coast of Africa . &quot;
the East African countries were accordingly upset and not willing to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts .
&quot; Kenya , Tanzania , Mauritius , the com@@ ors , Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobili@@ zing against the ship . they refused to punish one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; suddenly , the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply refused everything , &quot; &quot; recalls Benedi@@ ct Ki@@ il@@ u , a senior representative of the Ken@@ yan fishing authority . he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at his time . &quot;
in 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region : it was not able to catch fish there .
&quot; finally , it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pil@@ lage of the fish stocks of the country . &quot;
&quot; the core of this initiative , which investig@@ ates criminal practices and protects resources , was F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa : a network of countries , 2012 by the NGO Stop Il@@ legal Fishing ( halt Il@@ legal Fishing ) . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Somalia and Madagascar , the members of this network were the six countries , who then expelled the prime minister from their waters . &quot;
&quot; &quot; with this , we have eight countries that are like @-@ minded people and work together . they exchange information and stand at each other where it comes to illegal fishing , &quot; says Tony Long , head of the P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts project En@@ ding Il@@ legal Fishing . this project offers F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; illegal fishing is regulated by definition : what is caught is hidden , so it is extremely difficult to detect . thus , illegal fishing is a major cause of over@@ fishing of regions . &quot;
&quot; due to the deliber@@ ate dis@@ regard of existing laws , by which certain habitats and types are to be protected , illegal fishing can damage ecos@@ ystems that have a delicate balance . &quot;
&quot; while actions against illegal fishing had once been ham@@ pered by bureaucratic hur@@ d@@ les and circul@@ ated through the sn@@ ail speed , with the information between individual countries , actions today happen in real time , trac@@ eable to F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s digital communications platform . &quot;
&quot; for example , the individual countries can share lists of existing licenses , news on suspi@@ cious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection . &quot;
fish @-@ i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move around the open sea via satellite data .
&quot; this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas . also , suspi@@ cious lanes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships . &quot;
&quot; ideally , such investigations show whether the participating ships have a catch @-@ licence , where they were on the move and possibly whether they have a criminal offen@@ se . &quot;
&quot; countries that are against illegal fishing can , on the basis of this information , refuse to accept such ships in their ports . what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo , and that they can even be forced to pay pen@@ alties , as in the case of the prime minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; it &apos;s about considerable financial losses for the owner , which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it . &quot;
&quot; this is what we want to achieve , &quot; &quot; says P@@ er Erik Ber@@ gh , Managing Director of N@@ F@@ DS Africa . the latter is a consulting firm dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
a closed front
&quot; the platform already mentioned was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue , losing the eight members of the H@@ ISH @-@ i network each year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters . &quot;
&quot; East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fish@@ eries , which is why the region is attracting commercial fishing from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; such practices include actions such as sailing under false flag , fake license papers , speci@@ fying fantasi@@ es , fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an un@@ broken organized control system , &quot; &quot; says Long . &quot; &quot; in the past , a ship was able to fish illeg@@ ally and a country could then say &apos; You may not run my port . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; yet another country could say &apos; Come to me &apos; . &quot; &quot; and this legal lo@@ op@@ hole tries to close F@@ ISH @-@ i . &quot;
the closed front has so far been working .
&quot; since its inc@@ eption , F@@ ISH @-@ i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspi@@ cious vessels . &quot;
&quot; it has revealed criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania . it discovered ships that used several frau@@ dul@@ ent identi@@ ties , and it has persecuted and found escap@@ ing ships . &quot;
&quot; due to its cooperation with INTER@@ PO@@ L , the international authority to fight crime , F@@ ISH @-@ i can share and maintain information about illegal fishing across large distances . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; he builds a system that will help F@@ ISH @-@ i to locate suspi@@ cious vessels , more precisely . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; fish @-@ i &apos;s satellite system , which is constantly being developed , helps to track down the illegal vessels that love to hide . &quot;
&quot; &quot; illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position , &quot; says Dun@@ can Cop@@ eland , Chief Analy@@ st at Tr@@ y@@ gg M@@ at Tracking , an NGO specializing in fish@@ eries and F@@ ISH @-@ i technical support . &quot;
&quot; some of the ships , for example , turn off their automatic identification systems , with which they can no longer be located by satellites . &quot;
Cop@@ eland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information . it aims to help F@@ ISH @-@ i to find criminal ships with greater precision .
one model program
but can F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s team of African nations actually influence the un@@ question@@ able global problem of illegal fishing ?
&quot; John A@@ mos , President of the NGO Sky@@ Truth , believes that . &quot;
&quot; recently , Sky@@ Truth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oce@@ ana Marine Prot@@ ector : a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world through the position of every single trac@@ eable vessel . &quot;
&quot; &quot; together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing what they do , it simply makes sense , &quot; he says . &quot; here is a chance for countries to unite and to combine their resources for investigation . &quot;
&quot; we should do this on a global scale . &quot; &quot; P@@ ew Char@@ itable tru@@ sts has a similar project where a global system allows prosecution of ships . &quot;
&quot; there are signs that F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s activities not only detect crimes , but also deter them . &quot;
ships which used to f@@ ished without a license and had hardly expected any consequences now know they are being watched .
&quot; according to Ki@@ il@@ u , some of the countries participating at F@@ ISH @-@ i have now a 33 % increase in fishing turnover , since fishing boats buy more licenses . &quot;
&quot; after F@@ ISH @-@ i Somalia had helped to track Gre@@ ko 1 , the inspec@@ tors found there on board tow@@ ing nets , whose use is prohibited . &quot;
photo courtesy of F@@ ISH @-@ i Africa .
&quot; other countries also notice these successes . &quot; &quot; the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries , &quot; &quot; says Ki@@ il@@ u . &quot; &quot; we have become an object of study . &quot; &quot; in West Africa every year several hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing . &quot;
&quot; there have joined together six countries in 2015 , to the so @-@ called West Africa Task Force . they are also fighting the illegal fishing industry according to the same model as F@@ ISH @-@ i@@ . &quot; &quot; Safety is the goal of allowing even more such initiatives and structures to emerge in other regions too , &quot; &quot; says Cop@@ eland . &quot;
&quot; recently , F@@ ISH @-@ i &apos;s youngest member state Somalia was able to announce his first great triumph : in October , Gre@@ ko 1 , a ship that was on the road under false flag . and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used by drag nets which are now banned . &quot;
&quot; the ship was also inv@@ aded in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia . &quot; &quot; by taking measures against Gre@@ ko 1 they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing , &quot; &quot; says Ber@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; for F@@ ISH @-@ i this is another success of many . and at the same time the proof that such a special , collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the entire world ocean .

&quot; their articles appear in Wi@@ red Magazine , TED Education , the New York Times and the Guardian . situation in Venezuela escal@@ ates further : demonstrations in several cities with the aim of &quot; re@@ conquest the country &quot; &quot;
the road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations .
they are considered a protest against the government &apos;s decision to stop the referendum on the administration of President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro .

&quot; after the government of Venezuela rejected the opposition to a referendum on a referendum , the Venezu@@ el@@ ans re@@ acted in whose eyes the negotiations on the political and economic crisis of the country went into empt@@ iness by gathering in the streets . &quot;
&quot; under the h@@ ash@@ tag # La@@ Tom@@ a@@ De@@ Venezuela ( about the revers@@ ing of Venezuela ) , both these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found . &quot;
&quot; the debate is also carried out in other parts of the country - including the Bar@@ inas low@@ land area , in the An@@ de@@ an regions MÃ©@@ ri@@ da and T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a , in the central North Bun@@ de@@ je Car@@ ab@@ ob@@ o and on Isla Margar@@ ita in the state of Nu@@ eva E@@ spart@@ a . &quot;
&quot; the country &apos;s political and economic situation deterior@@ ates continuously , which is reflected in the everyday life of the Venezu@@ el@@ ans by an acute lack of food and medication . &quot;
&quot; many representatives of the opposition saw the opportunity for a fundamental change in the up@@ lift of the current President Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ uro , but ultimately the reluct@@ ance of a re @-@ election was blocked by the official authorities . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ anne D@@ Ã­@@ az , contribut@@ or to Global Vo@@ ices in Venezuela , summ@@ arises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows : &quot;
&quot; as part of the social , political and economic crisis , the inflation and profit rate is one of the highest in the whole world ( the inflation rate is estimated at 500 % of the annual financial year ) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists , the referendum on minist@@ erial activity was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance . &quot;
&quot; the electoral alliance Mes@@ a de la Uni@@ dad Demo@@ cr@@ Ã¡@@ tica or shortly MU@@ D ( for example : round table of the Democratic Union ) , in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together , called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly , which , after the elections of 2015 , was scheduled to continue on 3 November . &quot;
the call was commented on Twitter among other things as follows :
&quot; it is as far as Venezuela : morning National Assembly , Friday country @-@ wide civil strike and on November 3 all go to Car@@ ac@@ as to the Mira@@ fl@@ ores Palace . &quot;
what to say ! pic@@ .@@ t@@ wit@@ ter@@ .com / 9@@ Zy@@ V@@ G@@ ld@@ n@@ ry

&quot; the re@@ conquest of Venezuela &quot;
&quot; the first demonstration in the frame of the &quot; &quot; Re @-@ conquest of Venezuela &quot; &quot; took place on Wednesday , October 26th . &quot;
&quot; the pictures of the mar@@ ches published in real time testify among other things an overwhelming involvement of people in numerous areas of the country , but also confron@@ tations with polic@@ emen as well as supporters of the government . &quot;
one of the most commonly shared pictures shows a demonstr@@ ator calling through the prot@@ ectors : &quot; will you kill me because I &apos;m hungry ?
&quot; will you kill me , because I &apos;m hungry ? &quot; &quot; this Venezu@@ el@@ an cries . &quot;

&quot; on Twitter there are pictures that tell about disputes , as well as reports of oppression and abuse . &quot;
especially big waves beat the news about police repression in the centrally located town of Mar@@ ac@@ ay .
there the demonstr@@ ators went back to the local cathedral in order to protect themselves against the police and armed supporters of the government .
&quot; hours later they could safely leave the cathedral , but the protests continued . &quot;
&quot; in other parts of the country , some demonstr@@ ators tried to stop police forces , including this woman in the An@@ de@@ an State of T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a : &quot;
&quot; the women in T@@ Ã¡@@ chir@@ a do not wear skir@@ ts , because otherwise you could see something that many National Guard don &apos;t have ! &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , an info@@ graphic shows the amount of repression per day : &quot;
thus the dictatorship has oppressed the country .
&quot; many representatives of the government had questioned the validity of the demand for a term of office , which has now been proven in the eyes of many by the presence of countless people on the street . &quot;
My@@ t@@ eks Media Lab@@ s for this purpose :
Nicol@@ Ã¡s and Di@@ os@@ dado claim that 1 % of the signatures are fal@@ si@@ fied .
here is your administration up@@ lift !
on the road !
&quot; others appreciate these protests as a further step in the fight against a government , which , from their point of view , has taken little against the disa@@ strous economic crisis and has preferred to prevent critical voices : &quot;
they took us so much - but also fear !
mar@@ ches always increase in frequency and intensity .
some Venezu@@ el@@ ans told the media that they were too hungry to take part in a strike rather than working or shopping .

&quot; this is an adap@@ table version of an interview by Ale@@ jo G@@ Ã³@@ me@@ z with Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , which was published on 23 August 2016 at D@@ Ã­a a D@@ Ã­a , an Argent@@ ine@@ an news page . &quot;
the interview was translated into English and is published here with kind permission .
&quot; when he was 15 years old , Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was forced by his father to take part in the atro@@ cities in La Per@@ la , a secret prison in the Argent@@ ine@@ an city of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; as an adult man , Qui@@ j@@ ano now spoke against his father as part of the great La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial in the province of CÃ³rdoba . &quot;
&quot; in the trial ended on 24 August 2016 , crimes committed during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship have been investigated . &quot;
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano did not choose his life .
&quot; starting with the burden of carrying the same name as his father , up to the brutal military operations in the prison of La Per@@ la , which he observed at the age of 15 , he suffered enough . &quot;
for 34 years he kept the secret of family secrets .
in the situation at that time I thought it was fine .
I felt like a secret .
&quot; as a child with 15 years of age , one does not notice that one is manipul@@ ated by his father . &quot;
&quot; at that time I couldn &apos;t realize that my father was a th@@ ief , a tor@@ turer and a mur@@ derer . &quot;
&quot; Luis had no choice : his father Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano was a gendar@@ mer@@ ie . during the Argent@@ inian military dictatorship from 1974 to 1983 , a time of state terrorism , his father was Deputy Commander of Intelligence Department in La Per@@ la from 1976 to 1978 . &quot;

&quot; but this is not the story of Luis Qui@@ j@@ ano , the oppres@@ sor , who was accused of kidn@@ apping in 158 cases , torture , murder in almost 100 cases and kidn@@ apping of a 10 year old child . &quot;
&quot; no , this is the story of Luis Qui@@ jan@@ os &apos;s son , a man who , over the years , recognized the extent of the atro@@ cities he had experienced as a boy , and who testified before a Federal Court against his own father . &quot;
his story shows what great power a parent has over his child and how this child has chosen a way of salvation .
from the sports hall to the military base
&quot; when my father started to take me to the military base , I often went to the sports hall . &quot;
all called him &quot; K@@ ent . &quot;
I told my father about him and a few days later he showed me a black @-@ and @-@ white photo and asked me to identify my friend .
he said :
&quot; you are an as@@ sh@@ ole , you have become friends with one of the ERP . &quot;
&quot; pass only that they will not lead you one day , and I must save you . &quot;
&quot; the abbrevi@@ ation ERP is for E@@ j@@ Ã©r@@ c@@ ito Revol@@ u@@ ci@@ on@@ ario del Pu@@ eb@@ lo , - Revolutionary People &apos;s Army - the military arm of the Argent@@ inian working party . &quot;
&quot; for that reason , he banned me to go back to the sports hall . a few days later he took me to work on the military base . &quot;
&quot; he told me , I would be healed . &quot;
I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok .
&quot; on the military base , I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; these were all possible documents : university degrees , hand@@ written notes , literature , certificates , propaganda material , books , simply everything . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; then the prisoners are tortured &quot; &quot; &quot;
my dad took me four times to La Per@@ la - everything in 1976 .
at the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car .
&quot; when he took me the second time , he ordered me to go out . he led me to a barracks where cars , furniture , TV , fri@@ dges - just everything possible - stood . &quot;
everything was stolen .
&quot; he gave me a small pack@@ et wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car . when I opened it , I saw that there was a big lum@@ ps of silver . &quot;
this day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were put off and kept me with a guard post .
suddenly he pointed to an open space and said :
then the prisoners are tortured .
&quot; I saw it , and saw a couch where people were tortured . &quot;
she looked like a field bed and metal feathers .
later I found out that she had attached to it one end of a cable . the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there .
&quot; they rarely tied a man with hand@@ cu@@ ffs to the bed , poured it with water and ch@@ ased him a charge of 220 vol@@ ts into the gen@@ itals . &quot;

the sten@@ ch there was horri@@ fic ... like a dirty win@@ der .
&quot; years later , when my father was under house arrest , the same smell came out of his room . &quot;
I immediately realized the smell once more and it became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need .
I never forgot this smell .
and I asked myself : how is it possible that one person can do so much suffering to another person ?
I knew these people were killed .
&quot; when my father took me to work for the third time , he led me to the entrance of La Cu@@ ad@@ ra - the area where the prisoners were bound with hand@@ cu@@ ffs and wore ey@@ eb@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; he spoke to &quot; Ch@@ ub@@ i &quot; Lop@@ ez ( Jose L@@ Ã³@@ pez , a civilian who was also accused of trial ) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cu@@ ad@@ ra . &quot;
in the background I saw a number of matt@@ resses on which naked people lay with their face down - all were tied at their hands and feet .
&quot; near the entrance , people c@@ rou@@ ched on the matt@@ resses . &quot;
&quot; when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners , he said , &quot; &quot; What do you see , as@@ sh@@ ole ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; I replied , &quot; &quot; Why did you bring me down ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I knew these people were killed .
they were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers .
I know this because my father told about it at home .
&quot; in addition to La Cu@@ ad@@ ra , several rooms were designated as offices . &quot;
I know that &quot; Pal@@ ito &quot; Rom@@ ero crashed and killed a man there .
&quot; according to reports of survivors , the civil service Jorge Rom@@ ero , who was also accused of the La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial , died to the students Ra@@ Ãº@@ l Mat@@ eo Mol@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; in the following video , Emi@@ lio Fes@@ sia , the director of the La Per@@ la Memorial , passes through the former torture chambers . &quot;
the way you came in here is also the way on which the kidn@@ apped came here .
&quot; when you look at the map , you see that they took about this road and then were tortured for the first time . &quot;
&quot; here , their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of de@@ human@@ ization . &quot;
&quot; when they survived the torture , the prisoners were thrown into the cu@@ ad@@ ra , until the order from above came that they should be moved . &quot;
this was the lie - the eu@@ ph@@ em@@ ism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their corp@@ ses in most cases .
the &apos; war yield &apos;
my father brought all sorts of stolen things home .
&quot; at that time , I had no idea what the &quot; &quot; war yield &quot; &quot; - as they called it - was . &quot;
&quot; but when I was in the army later , I was in the gendar@@ mer@@ ie - it became clear to me that war spo@@ ils are a bay@@ on@@ et , or perhaps military bad@@ ges that one takes away from an enemy you fought . &quot;

&quot; but when you go into a house and the fridge , the turn@@ table , clothes , paintings , money ... ste@@ als , then this is not war yield but v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
this is ste@@ aling .
&quot; I have always wondered how my father , the leader of the security forces , could join this v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t understand .
I was also an officer at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it .
I don &apos;t understand how my dad could do that .
&quot; once he called me a criminal , and I answered , &quot; &quot; You who steal the cars on the road ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
you are not a criminal ?
&quot; he explo@@ ded against anger , struck me and cried , &quot;
&quot; if you go so far , I will find you and kill you . &quot;
we don &apos;t need anybody else !
so was my father .
I have no one good memory of him .
&quot; when I went out in the process , I showed a photo of back then , on which I wore a jacket and a jum@@ per pul@@ lover made of wool . both had my dad from La Per@@ la . &quot;
&quot; we were not poor , but he still brought clothes home . &quot;
&quot; at that time the defense accused me of being a con@@ spir@@ ator in this crime . I replied , no problem , they can burden me what they wanted . &quot;
anyway I was there to testify .
&apos;@@ the disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last vile act &apos;
&quot; now , where I am older , I feel re@@ mor@@ se . &quot;
&quot; I have children . once you have children , you can see the value of a life . &quot;
one develops further and real@@ ises that it is wrong to kill .
I even went so far to say :
&quot; well , you have executed people during the dictatorship , but why did the corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
why children kidn@@ ap ?
&quot; one day , my father brought a girl with home , whose mother had been killed . &quot;
&quot; she was like our pet , almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl . &quot;
&quot; I always asked myself the question : they were tortured , but why were they killed ? &quot;
they could have put them in jail .
&quot; I guess it has simply been decided to kill these people , but why their corp@@ ses disappear ? &quot;
did these people not also have families to whom they could hand over their mort@@ al remains ?
the disappearance of corp@@ ses is the last elu@@ sive act that one can do to a man .
&quot; my father told me when democracy was re@@ introduced , they took machines to eliminate the mort@@ al remains of the prisoners . &quot;
&quot; they were crushed and dispos@@ ed of somewhere - no idea where . &quot; you &apos;ll never find anything , &quot; my father said . &quot;
but something remains of course always .
I have seen how you killed people !
just to make it clear : I have nothing against the military .
I was even at the gendar@@ mer@@ ie .
I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father .
the idea of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest .
I repro@@ ached him for all the cru@@ el@@ ties that I had to witness because of him .
&quot; then he suddenly said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know . I didn &apos;t kill anybody . &quot;
&quot; I felt in@@ war@@ dly rejected and asked me what all the exagger@@ ated patri@@ ot@@ ism and the &quot; &quot; Western and Christian feelings &quot; &quot; which they supposedly defended were actually good . &quot;
then I cried out :
how can you tell me ?
I have seen how you killed people !
you committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child .
&quot; he replied only , &quot; &quot; Please forgive me . &quot; &quot; &quot;
this is exactly what I did .
in 2010 I replaced the first ad .
I finally realized that he was a criminal .
no one can repro@@ ach me that I am pre@@ occupied . I have finally cancelled my own father .
Luis Alberto Qui@@ j@@ ano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial .
&quot; he was charged with 4@@ 16 off@@ ences : including severe , un@@ lawful de@@ priv@@ ation of liberty in 158 cases , torture in 15@@ 4 cases , murder in 98 particularly severe cases , torture followed by death sequence in five cases and a case of kidn@@ apping of one under 10 @-@ year @-@ old child . &quot;

the Jud@@ gments in the &quot; Meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot;
the term &quot; meg@@ ac@@ aus@@ a &quot; refers to the magnitude of the sentence in Spanish .
&quot; after four years in which more than 5@@ 81 witnesses were heard , the historic La Per@@ la @-@ Ri@@ bera trial ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 7@@ 16 victims finally in August . &quot;
&quot; 43 oppres@@ sors were found guilty of crimes against humanity and sentenced to life imprisonment in 28 cases , and in nine cases prison sentences between 2 and 14 years . in six cases there were acqu@@ itt@@ als . &quot;
eleven of the original 54 defend@@ ants died during the trial .
&quot; # La@@ Per@@ la@@ judgement : murder , torture and rape by officials . &quot;
&quot; all defend@@ ants were members of the military during the dictatorship , including former military personnel , former police personnel and civilian staff . &quot;
Pier@@ o De Mon@@ ti was ab@@ duc@@ ted together with his pregnant wife in June 1976 and brought to La Per@@ la .
he addressed the following words to the silent chamber :
La Per@@ la was a death factory designed by un@@ human heads .
the court ruling is a historic milestone for all human rights organisations who have worked for years on justice for the victims .
&quot; Claudio O@@ ros@@ z , the lawyer of the Argent@@ ine@@ an organization H.@@ I.@@ J.@@ O.@@ S. , founded in 1995 , who represents the children of people murdered or disappeared during the dictatorship , said : &quot;
&quot; the process lasted more than three years , but research for it lasted 39 years . &quot;
&quot; in March 2007 , the Argent@@ inian government handed over the country on which La Per@@ la was located , so that there could be a memorial erected by human rights organisations . &quot;

a translation error makes older people in Kyoto to &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful drivers &quot;
&quot; the sign with the translation error at a centre in Kyoto , where you can extend your driver &apos;s license . &quot;
the photo was spread in social media .
editing of the original screen@@ shot by Joshua Lev@@ ine .
&quot; in the Japanese city of Kyoto , customers of a newly opened centre in which one can pro@@ long his driving licence , in the last month witnesses of a particularly mis@@ used translation . &quot;
&quot; on a sign , the Japanese word was put into the &quot; &quot; older mot@@ orists &quot; , &quot; the &quot; older mot@@ orists , &quot; fal@@ sely - but perhaps also with evil rear @-@ thought &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; as &quot; &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the wrong translation was to be read from 1 to 20 September on electronic ads in the entrance area and in the building itself .
&quot; editing of the original screen@@ shot by Joshua Lev@@ ine , often shared in the social media . &quot;
&quot; the error was noticed by the translator Julian Hol@@ mes , a resident of Ky@@ ot@@ os . he was also the one who made aware of the local papers . &quot;
the Kyoto @-@ published daily Kyoto S@@ him@@ bu@@ n wrote :
&quot; &quot; &quot; how could it come to such an English translation ? &quot;
this proves that no one has read the translation correction .
&quot; this is an insul@@ t to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable , &quot; &quot; said Hol@@ mes . &quot;
&quot; the er@@ ron@@ eous English translation was removed initially . the term &quot; &quot; terrible drivers &quot; &quot; was later replaced by the appropriate , though gram@@ mati@@ cally not quite correct term &quot; &quot; elder drivers &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; older drivers &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the police of the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture have ap@@ ologi@@ zed for the translation error . furthermore , she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published . &quot;
a blo@@ gger reported as follows about the ap@@ ology :
&quot; we are sincer@@ ely sorry that elderly people felt offen@@ ded by the inadequate correction ( translation ) , &quot; the police said . &quot;
the Japanese online intelligence service J @-@ C@@ ast News deals with the phenomenon of the &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; older mot@@ orists in Japan and wrote :
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; aw@@ ful &quot; &quot; was den@@ ounced as an in@@ appropriate description of older mot@@ orists . according to the police , the proportion of older mot@@ orists , who are involved in accidents throughout the country , is a reason for concern . &quot;
&quot; in the Kyoto pre@@ f@@ ecture , for example , 1,@@ 9@@ 41 of a total of 19,@@ 4@@ 60 accidents were caused by sen@@ iors in 2005 . this corresponds to a proportion of 10 % . &quot;
&quot; ten years later , in 2014 , sen@@ iors created 1,@@ 80@@ 3 of a total of 11,@@ 850 accidents . &quot;
this increased its share to 17.@@ 7 % .
&quot; while the number of accidents has decreased overall , the proportion of incidents caused by sen@@ iors has increased in the same period . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ porter , named not named , brought comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo , which show what prejudi@@ ces some Japanese apparently he@@ eded against older mot@@ orists : &quot;
&quot; the article on Yahoo for translation errors , among other things , received the following comments : &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; is this ( &quot; &quot; dre@@ ad@@ ful mot@@ orists &quot; &quot; ) about not reality ? &quot;
&quot; - &quot; &quot; So er@@ ron@@ eous is the translation not really bad , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
- &quot; I don &apos;t think it &apos;s a real translation error .
there are not a few such comments .
why &quot; En@@ gr@@ ish &quot; is so widespread throughout Asia
translation errors are widespread in Japan and throughout Asia .
the En@@ gr@@ ish@@ .com website is a real treasure tro@@ ve for these bizarre mistakes in English .

the reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold .
&quot; for transl@@ ating , you need two important skills : passive language skills in order to understand the source text and take active language skills to translate it into the target language . &quot;
&quot; the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers . in general , the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers . &quot;
&quot; for example , a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
&quot; many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language , which could produce translations into English . this may be due to a lack of understanding for transl@@ ating , cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese . &quot;
&quot; some companies , who do not have a foreign employee themselves , nevertheless make translations available internally . then , the Japanese employee , whose English skills are considered the best , are made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Karl Baron .
mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results .
&quot; the confused and en@@ ig@@ matic sentences , created by machine translations , show that this technique can &apos;t replace a human translator for a long time . this is especially true for some languages . &quot;
&quot; some of the stran@@ gest English form@@ ulations in Japan , including the en@@ ig@@ matic im@@ prints , which often decorate shirts or bags , are only used for styl@@ istic reasons - not to be read or understood . &quot;
photo by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Joseph Br@@ ent .
&quot; translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery . however , by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards , we can expect more careful translations . &quot;
&quot; in the future , the city of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more serious source for its translations . &quot;
Venezuela : protests and cens@@ orship measures on the Internet and TV take place
&quot; main page of the portal &quot; Nav@@ egar con Liber@@ ta@@ d &quot; ( Free surfing ) of the IP@@ Y@@ S ( Institu@@ to Pr@@ ens@@ a y Soci@@ e@@ dad , Institute for Press and Society ) . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning , 7 April , Venezu@@ el@@ an Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay online channel . &quot;
&quot; later , other users wrote that the websites of V@@ PI@@ TV and El Cap@@ it@@ o@@ lio TV were no longer accessible . &quot;
&quot; other online transm@@ it@@ ters carried out recordings of the protests in Car@@ ac@@ as , organised by opposition groups , who oppose the government of Nicol@@ Ã¡s Mad@@ u@@ ros . &quot;
&quot; the protests began at the beginning of April , after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and had transferred the Parliament &apos;s tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself . &quot;
&quot; Luis Carlos D@@ Ã­@@ az , journalist and author at Global Vo@@ ices , published the results of a tra@@ cer@@ ou@@ tes . he pointed out that the connection was ch@@ apped , and advised the users to use VPN ( virtual private networks ) to access the Internet . &quot;
# cens@@ orship : activ@@ ates your VPN .
it seems that websites Venezu@@ el@@ an providers are once again locked .
this is from the side of @ Vi@@ vo@@ Play@@ Net .
&quot; offers such as Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay are popular among the Venezu@@ el@@ ans with Internet access , especially in times of un@@ rest . &quot;
&quot; traditional media have been reluct@@ ant to report on protests since 2014 . at the time , the Commission for Telec@@ ommunic@@ ations threatened them with fin@@ es and closures if they continued to report on the demonstrations , as the Commission saw this as a &quot; call to violence . &quot; &quot;
I have registered with @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net without cable TV and informative national TV channels .
amazing that this is still cheaper than buying two litres of le@@ mon@@ ade .
&quot; the local NGO VE@@ sin@@ fil@@ tro confirmed later that not only Vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay was in@@ accessible by blocking the Domain Name System ( DNS ) , but also two other online transm@@ it@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; earlier research by the Institute for Press and Society ( IP@@ Y@@ S ) , a research group for digital rights in Venezuela , had shown that local Internet providers sometimes use DNS . &quot;
&quot; if a Internet page is blocked by the DNS , the server rep@@ lies er@@ ron@@ eous or refuses the request when calling such a website . &quot;
&quot; we confirm a DNS lock : @ el@@ capit@@ oli@@ ot@@ v , @ V@@ PI@@ TV and @ vi@@ v@@ op@@ lay@@ net &quot;
&quot; V@@ PI@@ TV , a third blocked channel , was hired on Thursday , April 6 , when the V@@ PI@@ TV cam@@ er@@ aman El@@ vis Flor@@ es , who transferred the protests to Car@@ ac@@ as live , was captured . &quot;
Flor@@ es was beaten while he was in police custody .
&quot; eight hours later , he was released , and V@@ PI@@ TV went on stream again . &quot;
&quot; although some channels are still accessible via YouTube , the government has also reported that the government regul@@ ates Internet connections , making it more difficult for the Venezu@@ el@@ ans to access multimedia coverage of current events in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , many girls become slaves to obtain an education &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta as a child . now she visits the house where she worked for years .
&quot; today , Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testim@@ onies from other Cri@@ adi@@ tas , who were just as victims of abuse and discrimination . &quot;
photo by Ceci@@ lia Ro@@ jas . use courtesy of cur@@ ator .
the following article is the shortened version of a cur@@ sed report published by Global Vo@@ ices with the kind permission of the authors .
&quot; the article is part of a series entitled &quot; Vac@@ as que v@@ u@@ el@@ an , Esc@@ u@@ el@@ as que Ca@@ en , &quot; which is edited and re @-@ published by Global Vo@@ ices Latin America . &quot;
Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there .
shortly before her gradu@@ ation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her . &quot; she is like a daughter for us .
&quot; she , who has become something , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
but Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was never treated like a daughter in this house .
&quot; when she was ten years old , she began to work as Cri@@ adi@@ ta for the family . as Cri@@ adi@@ tas , in Paraguay the more than 4@@ 6.000 cub@@ s and girls were forced to work to go to school . &quot;
&quot; the business is quite simple : a big family with little money transfers their under@@ age son or her minor daughter to another , more rich family . in exchange , the child receives food , training and a roof above the head . &quot;
&quot; what is not mentioned , however , is that the children have to do house@@ work innumerable days that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; this practice , described as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go , is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations . &quot;
&quot; after gradu@@ ating , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls . &quot;
&quot; she talked to Cri@@ adi@@ a - especially young girls affected by the practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go - collected testim@@ onies , resear@@ ching and den@@ oun@@ cing . &quot;
&quot; she tried to call things by name , because the feeling of gratitude which is ino@@ cul@@ ated to Cri@@ mean tas warran@@ ts silence in general . &quot;
&quot; the Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go is based on double dec@@ eption , &quot; explains Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , the family who has their daughter in believing that they complete their education , improve their position in society and &quot; &quot; make something out &quot; &quot; can be handed over to another family . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the family that assimil@@ ates the girl with herself and justi@@ fies her exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even star@@ ved . &quot;
the victims of Cri@@ min@@ az@@ go
&quot; when the girl is mi@@ stre@@ ated , his family will learn about it for many years . &quot;
sometimes they never experience it .
&quot; in January 2016 , the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon , which takes place in the secret of Paragu@@ ay@@ an households , got a face . &quot;
&quot; when Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n came to the hospital in Ca@@ agu@@ az@@ Ãº , her body showed traces of violent blows . shortly thereafter she died . &quot;
she was 14 years old .
&quot; she was Cri@@ par@@ ta in the household of the former military man Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and his wife Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo , who works as a civil servant at the Einwohn@@ er@@ mel@@ de@@ amt . &quot;
&quot; Mar@@ Ã­n lived with them in their house in V@@ aqu@@ er@@ Ã­a , a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n . &quot;
&quot; at the end of January 2016 , Fer@@ rei@@ ra entered Mar@@ Ã­n as long as she suffered le@@ thal injury . &quot;
this should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl .
&quot; a few days later , the media reported the incident . &quot;
they stressed that the murdered child was a Cri@@ adi@@ ta .
organizations such as UN@@ IC@@ EF or Call@@ es@@ cu@@ ela made the deeply rooted practice of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go responsible for the death of the girl in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an society .
they called the Cri@@ ti@@ az@@ go as &quot; a modern form of slavery . &quot;
several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there could be &quot; no further Carolina &quot; in Paraguay .
the girl &apos;s name and photos were widely used in social media .
&quot; in Paraguay , more cows are registered as children , &quot; says Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a . &quot;
without papers it is much easier to inj@@ ure the rights of children .
without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live .
the neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case .
&quot; they want Tom@@ Ã¡s Fer@@ rei@@ ra and Ram@@ ona Mel@@ g@@ are@@ jo for the murder of the girl who was their Cri@@ par@@ ta , sentenced to 30 years in prison . &quot;
&quot; if the case occurs in court , the case of Carolina Mar@@ Ã­n might be trend @-@ setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go comes to court . &quot;
the everyday life of a Cri@@ adi@@ ta
&quot; the Cri@@ adi@@ tas are not only exploited as workers , they also live isolated from other girls at their age . &quot;
&quot; Tina Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was ten years old when the Far@@ bi@@ k , in which her father worked , had to sign up bankrupt@@ cy and her father lost his job . &quot;
&quot; their brothers now had to work all the way and began selling sweets on the street , or on the market , to earn money . &quot;
but they all went on to school .
only Tina was sent as Cri@@ adi@@ ta to the capital As@@ unci@@ Ã³n .
&quot; in the house of their employers , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a worked between four and six hours each day . &quot;
she had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn .
she rose every morning at five o &apos;clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer .
&quot; for example , they cleaned the fridge , cleaned the living room , polished the furniture and dis@@ infected the floor . &quot;
&quot; when the school was over , she went home again and had time to learn . &quot;
&quot; the more she was finished with learning , the more free time she had . &quot;
but also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers .
&quot; Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a says she never had to star@@ ve , but didn &apos;t get unlimited food . &quot; I was allowed to pick more books from the master &apos;s library than eating out the fridge , &quot; she recalls . &quot;
&quot; the library was well equipped and belonged to the landlord , a former military and sympath@@ iz@@ ant of the Parti@@ do Liber@@ al , a liberal party which belonged to the opposition during the dictatorship of Al@@ fre@@ do Stro@@ ess@@ ner , who was in power from 1954 to 1989 . &quot;
&quot; at some evenings , the landlord of Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a forced to stand next to him and read the editorial from opposition newspapers such as &quot; Sen@@ der@@ o &quot; or &quot; El Pu@@ eb@@ lo . &quot; &quot;
he tried to convince them to give no faith to the reports of the official media about the dict@@ ator &apos;s regime .
&quot; he beha@@ ved intellig@@ ently , but did not stay with her . &quot; the host had found someone who listened while he talked about politics , &quot; she says . &quot;
they didn &apos;t often allow me to visit my family because they thought that I would learn &quot; bad habits &quot; there again . so they supposed that Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a that belongs to the indigenous group of Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ would return home to their native language Guar@@ an@@ Ã­ .
&quot; their Lord feared that they would lose the education they had allowed her to lose , she explains . &quot;
&quot; she was fully aware , however , that she had paid for everything she got from them with her hard work . &quot;
&quot; even in school , Al@@ var@@ eng@@ a was discrimin@@ ated against . &quot; one thing about which almost never is spoken is mo@@ bbing and the ch@@ ic@@ ans exposed to Cri@@ adi@@ a when they go to school . &quot;

I couldn &apos;t invite anyone to me home . I didn &apos;t have a circle of friends at school or in the neighborhood .

&quot; in January 2015 , a woman published the following text in a Facebook group , where you can share advertisements for cleaning staff and children &apos;s girls in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; the administrative coordinator of the group is Pep@@ a Kos@@ ti@@ an@@ ov@@ sky , a town coun@@ cill@@ or in the As@@ unci@@ Ã³n district . &quot;
Hello ! I am looking for a small companion for my little daughter who plays with her in the morning and in the afternoon .
for learning .
please contact us .
&quot; starting from Monday , if possible . &quot;
&quot; the display received five &quot; &quot; Li@@ kes &quot; &quot; and many comments . &quot;
a woman from the place Ã@@ em@@ by wrote that she had an eleven @-@ year @-@ old girl and gave her phone number .
&quot; another woman who also came from Ã@@ em@@ by offered her 15 @-@ year @-@ old ni@@ ece . &quot; she likes small children and is very pretty , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the third comment , &quot; a girl from the interior who would like to work &quot; was written . &quot;
then the summary of the display was once again switched on :
&quot; dear friends , I found one . I look if it works with it . &quot;
&quot; thank you , I write again when something is . &quot;
the business was completed .

the social inequality in Paraguay and that to display power are the key to understanding the phenomenon known as Cri@@ ad@@ az@@ go .
bill calls Egyptian users of social media to register with the government
&quot; Pix@@ ab@@ ay image , changed by Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
published under the Public Domain CC@@ 0 .
sixty Egyptian MPs have recently voted on a bill to &quot; regulate the use and use of social networks . &quot;
&quot; if adopted by the Parliament , users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; on the basis of the law , a place would then be set up which is mand@@ ated to give citizens permission to grant social media . &quot;
&quot; within six months of accepting the Act , users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity cards in order to be able to use social networks . &quot;
&quot; if this fails to do so , this could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fin@@ es . &quot;
&quot; the bill composed of six paragra@@ phs and cur@@ tail@@ ed in local media including You@@ m@@ 7 and Egypt Independent , defines social media as &quot; any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice , vide@@ ophone and text . &quot;
&quot; it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted , as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration . it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not currently able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies . &quot;
&quot; Ri@@ y@@ ad Ab@@ dul Satt@@ ar , Par@@ liam@@ entary deputy and promot@@ er of the bill , told the magazine Al @-@ Monitor , registered users received a username and password from the ministry of telecommunications to get through the fire@@ wall that blocks Facebook . &quot;
&quot; this could mean that Egypt plans to build a fire@@ wall on a national level around Facebook . because of those , it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network . &quot;
but it is not known until now that such plans exist .
experts on site are scep@@ tical about the technical feasibility of the proposal .
&quot; Ram@@ y Ra@@ o@@ of , Senior Research Techn@@ ologist ( in German &quot; leading research scientist &quot; ) of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights ( E@@ IP@@ R , in German &quot; Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights &quot; ) , said Global Vo@@ ices : &quot;
I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology .
&quot; in my opinion , they imagine that just as they viol@@ ently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online . &quot;
&quot; if I take them seriously , that means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not . and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a court process . &quot;
this is by no means realistic - but in Egypt all is possible .
&quot; in order to be adopted as a law , the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament &apos;s legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate . &quot;
&quot; whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not , the draft &quot; stands in line with a pro @-@ military way of thinking in parliament , in which the control is maxim@@ ized and safegu@@ ar@@ ded , &quot; says Ra@@ o@@ of . &quot;
&quot; last year , the parliamentary deleg@@ ate Tam@@ er El @-@ Sha@@ haw@@ y proposed a bill against cy@@ ber crime in which a life imprisonment sentence for those found guilty of threatening &quot; &quot; public order &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; to protest protests . &quot; &quot; &quot;
how a Kurdish conserv@@ ation@@ alist protects the Persian le@@ op@@ ard in Iraq designated by the war

&quot; this article by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was published in the original on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that deals with international environmental protection solutions . the article is published here as part of an agreement on content sharing . &quot;
&quot; high up in the mountains of the Kurdist@@ an Region in the north @-@ east of Iraq , the animal prot@@ ector H@@ ana Ahmed Raz@@ a and her team of scientists from the NGO Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghost of the Persian le@@ op@@ ard . &quot;
&quot; a sub@@ species of the larger family of le@@ op@@ ards , which ro@@ ams through Africa and Asia , belong to the Persian le@@ op@@ ards ( Pan@@ ther@@ a par@@ dus sax@@ ic@@ ol@@ or ) . altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals , so the International Union for Conservation of Nature . they are endangered due to Wil@@ der@@ ei , the loss and frag@@ mentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loo@@ t . &quot;
why is this particular kind of le@@ op@@ ard so important ?
&quot; as Raz@@ a shows in the video , &quot; &quot; the Persian le@@ op@@ ard is the only remaining predat@@ or in the Kurdish ecosystem &quot; &quot; and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on that a large predat@@ or is present . &quot;
&quot; the chance to see a Persian le@@ op@@ ard actually in the wild is low and goes against zero . as the team in the video shows that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera , Raz@@ a breaks out in pure joy . &quot;
&quot; as a bi@@ ologist , Raz@@ a passion@@ ately shows a different side of her country , which consists not only of war and conflict . &quot;
she has been involved in field studies for wild animals and educational programs of Nature Iraq for six years .
she has also been a member of the IU@@ CN / SS@@ C Cat Speci@@ alist Group since 2013 and is committed to establishing protected areas for wildlife in the Kurdist@@ an Region .

&quot; at the beginning of March 2017 , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o , the pro @-@ nor@@ theastern Japan , has documented the progress that has been achieved over the past six years to re@@ construct the lives of those affected by the &quot; triple disaster &quot; of March 2011 . a huge earthquake , a ts@@ un@@ ami and an atom earthquake in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had caused the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper has its headquarters in Sen@@ dai , which is located in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i Pre@@ f@@ ecture . Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i pre@@ f@@ ecture was a few pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures in Japan &apos;s northeast , which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting ts@@ un@@ ami . &quot;
hundreds of thousands of people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and the neighbouring villages Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate were forced to evacu@@ ate because the ts@@ un@@ ami had removed entire coastal cities from the map .
&quot; in addition , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture has experienced a nuclear accident , even so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes . &quot;
&quot; the special report of the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o shows , from the local perspective , what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents . &quot;
the detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese re@@ building authority and survey results of the affected persons themselves .
&quot; the apartment building in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate &quot;
&quot; the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper reports that until December 2015 , a total of 77 percent of the planned re@@ plac@@ ements ( which were completed , were completed in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures ) . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was the biggest success among the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , 80 percent of the planned re@@ plac@@ ements were completed . &quot;
&quot; I@@ w@@ ate has completed 75 percent of such houses , whereas Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma accounts for 70 percent of the closing light . &quot;
&quot; however , six years after the catastrophe , it is still possible to reloc@@ ate evacu@@ ated temporary shel@@ ters to final replacement houses six years after the catastrophe . &quot;
&quot; after the triple catastrophe , almost 80 000 people were forced to live in homes . &quot;
&quot; in December 2016 , still 36 000 people from Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma and I@@ w@@ ate lived in such homes . &quot;
&quot; almost 40 percent of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma in 2011 still live in emergency shel@@ ters , whereas Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was more successful here . more than 75 percent of the evacu@@ ees , who built after the disaster in homes , were reloc@@ ated to final homes . &quot;
&quot; for I@@ w@@ ate , the figure is 34 percent . &quot;
the state of work and everyday life in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures affected
&quot; as the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper was able to establish , 10@@ 74 of 1100 schools , affected by mis@@ fortune , opened their doors until December 2016 , which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures . &quot;
six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures is much more difficult .
&quot; while almost 100 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours in I@@ w@@ ate and Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i are now in operation , only 30 per cent of the fishing har@@ bours have resum@@ ed their operation in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; the ts@@ un@@ ami and the nuclear accident , in the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures of the agr@@ arian country , have largely affected agricultural land . &quot;
&quot; Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas , with only 66 percent of the farm@@ land in I@@ w@@ ate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land in Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident , because only 6@@ 90 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , are located in the &quot; nuclear lock zone . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in two of the three pre@@ f@@ ec@@ tures , tourism has recovered largely , but Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma is also far removed . &quot;
&quot; the tourist figures in Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i and I@@ w@@ ate are again 90 percent at the same level , as before disaster . Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , on the other hand , can only have 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; however , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal inhabitants , it seems to be more difficult to earn their living . &quot;
is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake ?
&quot; in order to determine the overall picture , the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacu@@ ees . it questioned them about the state of reconstruction and also how their feeling changed vis @-@ Ã  @-@ vis the ts@@ un@@ ami risk . &quot;
&quot; in its introduction , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o newspaper explains : &quot;
the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o conducted a survey to bring more about the ts@@ un@@ ami awareness among the local population .
the survey revealed that 8@@ 3.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthqu@@ akes and ts@@ un@@ am@@ is .
&quot; however , 5@@ 5.@@ 9 percent of respon@@ dents find that still not enough in terms of cat@@ astro@@ ph@@ es prevention has been done . &quot;
how it stands for those who had to be evacu@@ ated from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture
&quot; in her edition to commemor@@ ate the anniversary of the earthquake , the K@@ ah@@ ok@@ u Shi@@ mp@@ o Newspaper emphasized her attention to the situation of the evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma . &quot;
&quot; Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating ts@@ un@@ ami , no , Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma Pre@@ f@@ ecture was also a witness of the worst , disaster @-@ caused , nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed . &quot;
&quot; of 160 000 evacu@@ ees from Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , nearly 63 000 people were reloc@@ ated to areas outside the pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of 2016 there were a little more than 23@@ ,000 people , back to Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma , converted into permanent sub@@ stitutes . &quot;
&quot; after the state of 2017 , more and more 40,000 inhabitants of Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma res@@ ides outside their home pre@@ f@@ ecture . &quot;
&quot; in the disaster areas most of the evacu@@ ees are older than 50 years old . they are known to bring back their efforts to rebuild Mi@@ y@@ ag@@ i , I@@ w@@ ate and Fu@@ kus@@ hi@@ ma with massive construction projects . these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020 . &quot;
the world is small : our pod@@ cast &quot; In@@ to the Deep &quot;
&quot; when people meet people from other countries that speak a different language , the differences seem to be greater than the similarities . &quot;
&quot; after a while , however , one often recognizes that one more links than it seems at first sight . &quot;
&quot; these global connections are important as they challenge our prejudi@@ ces , expand our perspectives and remind us that the world is ultimately very small . &quot;
&quot; in this episode of In@@ to the Deep , the Global Vo@@ ices Pod@@ cast , we look at these global connections . in our In@@ to the Deep Pod@@ cast , we treat subjects that often get less attention in reporting than they deserve . &quot;
we speak with five Global Vo@@ ices members who remember a moment when they felt very strongly connected with someone over language and country borders .

a Brazilian student at the age of 33 was delivered to the intensive care unit this week : last Friday a police officer took him against his head during a demonstration in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia . millions of demonstr@@ ators took part in a protest march against austerity .
&quot; Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra da Silva , studied social sciences at the Federal University of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s , has suffered a skull @-@ brain trauma and several frac@@ tures . &quot;
doctors operated on him this Saturday and have now transferred him into an artificial coma .
his condition is considered critical .
the local image journalist Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z made photos of the attack on Mat@@ eus which spread rapidly within a few days quickly in Brazil .
&quot; on the pictures is also the face of the police officer , who attacked with a striking stick . the man was identified as August@@ o S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o . &quot;
&quot; after the incident , the military police in the Brazilian state of Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s announced that S@@ amp@@ ai@@ o had been suspended from active service until the conclusion of the investigation . &quot;
the pictures show the police officers as he strikes in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia with his striking stamp on the face of the student Mat@@ eus Fer@@ rei@@ ra ( photos : Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z ) .
&quot; if a polic@@ eman was beaten up by a demonstr@@ ator and land on the intensive care unit , his face would be on television for six months and the entire repression would be justified . &quot;
&quot; the Facebook page &quot; Des@@ eur@@ aliz@@ ador , &quot; a media activ@@ ist from Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia , shared the video recorded by Lu@@ iz da Lu@@ z in which one sees how Mat@@ eus is attacked by the police officer and several param@@ edi@@ cs shortly afterwards . &quot;
&quot; another video with the same scenes , but filmed from a different perspective , has also appeared in social networks . &quot;
&quot; in the clip shown below , you can see the attack on Mat@@ eus from the 50@@ th second . &quot;
&quot; for the Mat@@ eus family , who lives in another state , Internet users have now donated 10,000 Brazilian Re@@ ais ( about 2,@@ 700 euros ) to cover part of the cost of medical treatment and to enable his family to stay in Go@@ i@@ Ã¢@@ nia while he is hospit@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; be brave , Mat@@ eus . &quot;

&quot; on Facebook , Professor Pablo Sp@@ ell@@ ado calls for further violence against activists in Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s : &quot;
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s is experiencing a wave of political violence : here the activ@@ ist Guil@@ her@@ me Irish was assass@@ inated by his father , because he was sab@@ ot@@ aged the Occup@@ y movement in secondary schools . &quot;
police kno@@ bs out
&quot; Go@@ i@@ Ã¡s was not the only state in Brazil , in which there was brutal police operations against demonstr@@ ators last Friday . &quot;
&quot; polic@@ emen attended protests in the centre of Rio de Janeiro , where demonstr@@ ators had built a stage for speakers , rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
&quot; the MEP Fla@@ vio Ser@@ af@@ ini , Socialist and Peace Party ( P@@ SO@@ L ) , asked the police to ren@@ ounce violence against demonstr@@ ators via loudspeaker announcements . &quot;
&quot; this also includes a report in Fol@@ ha de SÃ£o Paulo , one of the oldest newspapers in the country . &quot;
&quot; once again , the Brazilian media have sli@@ pped off street protests by turning the focus on another unexpected protagon@@ ist : a wind@@ shield . &quot;
the Fol@@ ha de S. Paulo and Est@@ ado de SÃ£o Paulo talked about a broken glass window to illustr@@ atively design their title pages with a photo .
&quot; on the other hand , the O Glob@@ o preferred a cover story with a bus set on fire . &quot;
&quot; there is no plau@@ sible journ@@ alistic reason to report more about a broken window of windows than about the protests of thousands of people , who serve to defend a special cause . &quot;
&quot; this must also be recognised , if one is strictly against any form of material damage . &quot;
&quot; here too , the term &quot; v@@ and@@ alism &quot; gets absurd , dispro@@ portion@@ ate meaning , and the typical violence of the military police is covered by head@@ lines with the title &quot; prot@@ esters on confrontation course with the police . &quot; &quot;
the Dis@@ ast@@ alisation of For@@ gotten Villa@@ ges in Cuba
&quot; with the introduction of the law of Ã@@ l@@ varo Re@@ yn@@ oso , almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba joined the doors ( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta ) &quot;
&quot; the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich , located in the western Cuban province of May@@ abe@@ que , is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - no not@@ e@@ worthy sugar harvest on site . &quot;
it is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paraly@@ sed .
&quot; after the earthquake , the sugar cane industry stood still in the region , and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding of steel and concrete remained . &quot;
about 27@@ 2 workers had to re@@ invent themselves .
some changed the work .
others res@@ ign and commu@@ te daily to the factories that still gr@@ ind .
&quot; N@@ ene , a soldier veter@@ an , who rises every day at 4 : 00 in the morning , the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not depri@@ ve his sleep . &quot;
&quot; he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region , which are in operation again after a long in@@ active period because they were preserved . &quot;
that was something he did not expect .
&quot; N@@ ene re@@ members accurately to have heard that in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich the sugar cane plant would be preserved , but the promise was not kept . &quot;
&quot; the sugar cane industry already resist@@ ed the pla@@ gues , the fall of socialism , low market prices , in@@ efficiency , poor management decisions and climate change . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar , less than the volume produced in 1910 . &quot;
&quot; the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago , but the bad harv@@ ests are no news . &quot;
why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off ?
the old platform of the church saw even better times .
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
the reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity : the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive they became int@@ ol@@ erable for the country .
&quot; the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories , the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes . &quot;
they left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Cent@@ av@@ os ( 0.@@ 03 euros ) .
the solution for unemployment ?
the motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plant@@ ations and the sugar crisis on the world market .
&quot; however , the sugar price rose again about a decade ago . &quot;
&quot; the price of un@@ refined sugar between 15 and 16 Cent@@ av@@ os per pound must remain between 2017 and 20@@ 25 , according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and the FAO , the Food and Nutrition Organisation of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; if current production would reach the level of 2001 ( 3.6 million tonnes ) , raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country . &quot;
not everything went well
&quot; the present day will go into history with certainty , &quot; these were the first words of Cuban President F@@ ide@@ l Castro during his speech on October 21 , 2002 at the sugar factory in Lav@@ ander@@ o . &quot;
from then on the process of restructuring began in the sugar industry .
&quot; in the following years the shut@@ down of 98 sugar cane factories , more than 65 million people received their full sal@@ aries for further education . &quot;
the same happened in the sugar cane plant Greg@@ orio Ar@@ l@@ Ã©e Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich on 14 May 2004 .
Luis Alberto PÃ©@@ rez has been working in the factory since 1967 .
&quot; when N@@ ene , as he is known as a soldier , talks about the closure of the factory , the word he is most repeated is &quot; sc@@ am . &quot; &quot;
almost all respon@@ dents were in the same opinion : not one of them was informed that the factory would shut down .
&quot; in order for the place to be preserved , they formed a full @-@ time working group . &quot;
&quot; before the first year of closing , the first letters began to come . &quot;
&quot; it was officially written documents , which would only be distinguished with regard to the parts that would be removed , addressing the address and the date . &quot;
&quot; all were signed by Ul@@ ises Ros@@ ales del Toro , only the minister could appro@@ ve every withdrawal . &quot;
&quot; from then on , the responsibility was handed over and the letters were getting more and more frequent . &quot;
&quot; for two years , Juan Carlos River@@ o was responsible for the shut @-@ down factory and he was one who received the letters . &quot; the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation , &quot; he ass@@ ures . &quot;
&quot; Ed@@ dy Re@@ yes , 64 years old , wa@@ its for retirement in another plant , the Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma . &quot;
&quot; he was involved in the shut@@ down of the factory , in whose construction he helped . &quot;
&quot; with each part he removed , he dis@@ assembled one of his 31 years of work . &quot;
the most advanced industrial area of Cuba and the most important working lat@@ ch was extingu@@ ished .
&quot; in many cases , there were no alternatives to the work places and services that the facilities were generating in the communities in which they were . &quot;
&quot; we will never know whether during the Mam@@ mut &apos;s speech of 21 October 2002 , the then President saw in the eyes of the people present , when he guaranteed that for the areas whose factories were no longer in operation for five years , everything would run well . &quot;
the price of the population for the closure of the sugar cane factories
&quot; since 2004 , sugar cane has been extracted only highly by grinding . &quot;
( photo : Ju@@ lio B@@ ati@@ sta )
&quot; after two years , the folk community Greg@@ orio Ar@@ le@@ Ã© Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich learned that many things change , but not always for the better when a factory is closed . &quot;
&quot; when the sugar cane plant closed , or better said than they began to im@@ itate them , they also stopped to gr@@ asp@@ ing the road , which also dis@@ advant@@ aged other farms . &quot;
&quot; without work in the region , and with advanced age , N@@ ene and Ed@@ dy had to look for other factories . &quot;
they were made to spare parts .
&quot; without prospects for the future , many young people left the region . &quot;
&quot; in the area there was created a food factory , whose production is not even for the care of the community . &quot;
the ruins of the factory behind the new plant are still impressive .
&quot; at the end of 2016 N@@ ene returned to the factory Boris Luis Santa Col@@ oma , the ruins of the place where he began to work . &quot;
&quot; forty @-@ nine months bring the old soldiers a ran@@ som of two thousand Pes@@ o a month , in order to spend the years retired in Ma@@ Ã±@@ al@@ ich . &quot;

first Nations youth use hip @-@ hop to express themselves and get their own culture
inclusion of a song of &quot; Home to Me &quot; - Gr@@ assy Nar@@ rows First Nation .
photo taken with permission of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an .
young people of the First Nations communities in all of Canada deal with topics that are important to them . they do this by means of Hip @-@ Hop thanks to a number of hiking workshops .
&quot; as part of the N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an @-@ Tour since 2014 , workshop leaders bring mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups song@@ writing , recording , audio and video production and live performances . &quot;
&quot; the original workshops were led by pedago@@ gue David Ho@@ dges , who lives in Montreal and worked in North @-@ Que@@ bec with ten C@@ ree communities and then collabor@@ ated with the C@@ ree Hip @-@ Hop group The Nor@@ th@@ Stars . &quot;
&quot; the workshop begins with the fact that the young participants explore topics such as &quot; cultural identity , language , engagement , love , self @-@ acceptance &quot; or whatever comes to them . &quot;
these questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagon@@ ists .
&quot; because the workshops were so popular , the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Win@@ ne@@ b@@ ago in Neb@@ ras@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; this video of the school &apos; Na Ak@@ sa Gy@@ il@@ ak &apos; Yo@@ o in the area of the tribal school First Nation in British Columbia , for example , tells the story of Highway 16 , also called &quot; Highway of tears , &quot; a section of road in West Africa where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered . &quot;
&quot; for the most part , the cases were not elu@@ ci@@ dated . &quot;
the next video of the Nem@@ as@@ ka C@@ ree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation .
&quot; many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages , although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations . &quot;
&quot; in the following song , that the Wh@@ ap@@ mag@@ oo@@ stu@@ i C@@ ree First Nation has recorded , the refrain is sung on C@@ ree . &quot;
&quot; the young people involved received some help from Gary J@@ ol@@ ly from the Nor@@ th@@ star Hip @-@ Hop @-@ Group , who gave them a st@@ rop@@ he in the Eastern James Bay C@@ ree dialect . &quot;
&quot; on the Facebook page of N &apos;@@ we Jin@@ an , the verse is available in tran@@ script as well as a translation into English , which is translated into German here : &quot;
sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me
but I try to go on my days on Earth
this is the day when you will embrace our cry
because we have lost our way in life as a youth
but I believe that we will rise one day
I don &apos;t want to see how they live a bad life
&quot; thus , they can grow and move forward with our youth as well . &quot;
this is how they can do what they have ordained by the Creator .
&quot; in the comments section , the reader and advocate of the C@@ ree language Kevin Bro@@ us@@ se@@ au also makes a contribution and adds the verse in sy@@ ll@@ ab@@ ary ( which is also published on his blog and published here with permission ) : &quot;
&quot; in Japan , plastic dishes are not only shown in the restaurant &quot;
&quot; plastic dishes ( &quot; &quot; place &quot; &quot; ) outside a typical restaurant in Japan . &quot;

&quot; in Japan , one can see some plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant . &quot;
&quot; to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu , they are displayed near the entrance sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u ( &quot; &quot; plastic models of the dishes &quot; &quot; ) of any food served in this restaurant . &quot;
customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they are entering or continuing the restaurant .
there is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes .
&quot; in the Tokyo district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , there are a large number of these small businesses that precisely produce those plastic dishes that the German film@@ maker W@@ im Wen@@ ders documented in his film Tokyo @-@ G@@ a more than 20 years ago . &quot;
&quot; for most Japanese , these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them . however , a new trend is now transforming them into show@@ y mobile accessories and other gad@@ gets . &quot;
at Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome the B@@ logger it@@ ini@@ i published a number of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u .
now in special sale : new plastic rib@@ bons decorated cell phone tapes as shown at K@@ ich@@ i@@ jo@@ ji Tok@@ y@@ u department store .
&quot; many of these artificial food were transformed into kit@@ sch@@ y collective objects , as in this case , fridge magn@@ ets : &quot;
here are a few sho@@ u fridge magn@@ ets for a new exhibition in the Tokyo Station .
the new boom of ess@@ ences is becoming increasingly complex .
in this case a ka@@ orph@@ an@@ don ( a popular rice dish with seafood ) was turned into a cell phone stand .
for this tri@@ angular bowl ( lo@@ l ) we found a good use as a mobile stand .
we also made this part for the exhibition at the Tokyo Station .
and here is an apple pe@@ eling your mobile phone :
&quot; designed to look like an apple , with a not@@ ch for mobile phone , this is a great design . &quot;
and that is just the beginning of an increasing flight into the com@@ ical .
&quot; some mobile phone stand and mobile designer allow you to make your own work of art . in this case , i@@ kur@@ a and laugh@@ s@@ wind@@ y are used , a popular t@@ opping that is served with white rice . &quot;
&quot; on Twitter , some users had their doubts : &quot;
&quot; is there somebody who would say &quot; &quot; wow , cool , now I can decorate my mobile with laugh@@ ing che@@ ers ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think I &apos;ll be the only one .
&quot; this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appeti@@ zing form , for example to surprise colleagues or family members uncomfortable . &quot;
our latest mobile phone stand has the shape of melting ice .
&quot; in addition , there are also rice balls ( oni@@ gir@@ i ) , earrings and hand@@ y@@ bands made of dried salmon . &quot;
&quot; more bizarre plastic dishes can be found at : it@@ ini@@ i &apos;s Na@@ ver Mat@@ ome blog post . or follow Twitter the h@@ ash@@ tag # , which is the place where you can get to the N@@ ash@@ tag # . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to learn more about the origin of this trend , this video gives you an insight into the district of Kapp@@ ab@@ ashi , dedicated to the supply of the restaurant industry . as for example with the sh@@ ok@@ u@@ hin san@@ pur@@ u . &quot;
the following video shows how the Japanese plastic dishes are actually made .
a Mexican project tells the stories of the survivors of the struggle against organised crime
&quot; for the victims of the struggle against drug dealers . &quot; &quot; &quot;

&quot; in reports of domestic and foreign media about the not@@ orious &quot; &quot; fight against drug trafficking &quot; &quot; in Mexico , the suspi@@ ci@@ ons and the killed regularly appear only in statistics . however , they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that ent@@ ails this struggle . &quot;
&quot; reporting on drugs bos@@ ses such as El Chap@@ o Gu@@ z@@ m@@ Ã¡n , the leader of the Sin@@ alo@@ a cart@@ el , completely over@@ threw the stories of the victims of the conflict . &quot;
&quot; the day after a violent incident , hardly anybody looks at the ber@@ eav@@ ed or the churches that have learned to live with the pain . &quot;
&quot; behind each body , behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves , the stories of countless parents , sons and daughters , friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed . &quot;
&quot; this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co launched the digital project &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; &quot; ( German : &quot; &quot; learning with Drug Tra@@ ffi@@ cking &quot; &quot; ) , which tells the victims a voice and tells stories of people who were in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cart@@ els . &quot;
animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co describes the project like this :
organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives .
the effects are much more profound .
&quot; for example , when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk . &quot;
the pain of the victims
a video entitled &quot; Vi@@ das que Cam@@ bian p@@ or el mi@@ edo &quot; ( German : &quot; how fear life changes &quot; ) tells exactly these stories .
&quot; a main character is Guadal@@ upe , a father who searches secret tom@@ bs for his son every weekend . &quot;
&quot; Emma Vel@@ eta Ro@@ dr@@ Ã­@@ gu@@ ez , who only one day lost her father , her four brothers , her husband and two of her ne@@ ph@@ ews . &quot;
&quot; priest : &quot; &quot; like every Sunday , we are preparing ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for tom@@ bs , according to the people we have loved . &quot;
Guadal@@ upe Con@@ tr@@ eras : &quot; my son is Antonio Ivan Con@@ tr@@ eras Mat@@ a .
he was 28 when he disappeared .
he has three children .
he worked in an electric shop in El Nar@@ an@@ jo .
on 13 October he left the house .
&quot; on October 15th , he should be back again , but he never came back . &quot; Emma Vel@@ eta : &quot; it &apos;s very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need training . &quot;
&quot; there is also my mother , who is here with me too . &quot;
at the moment she has no income .
&quot; you are the insurance of my father , but it won &apos;t pay you off because they require a death certificate . &quot;
where should we get that ?
the editors of &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a vivi@@ r con el Nar@@ co &quot; explain why the project is so important :
&quot; we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid . we must show the international community the conflicts , frag@@ ility and governance . &quot;
the project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high @-@ risk areas .
here are some excer@@ pts from the stories .
&quot; K@@ Y@@ H@@ B , a reader of Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co , wrote this post from Tax@@ co , in the Federal State of Gu@@ err@@ ero in central Mexico . &quot;
&quot; their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal , no matter what form it occurs : &quot;
I have known disease and journ@@ alism for several years now .
&quot; I come to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks every day and see the front pages with pictures , which can only come from a text@@ book for crimin@@ ology or from specialists from specialists . &quot;
it brings me out of the frame .
sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgu@@ sted or sad . it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body .
I can &apos;t be in@@ different about it or consider this as normal .
she writes on :
&quot; no , it &apos;s not normal that my 10 @-@ year @-@ old cous@@ in thinks that he wants to become Nar@@ co ( German : drug dealers ) when he is big . and it &apos;s also not normal that people hear songs about the &quot; hero@@ ism &quot; of the offen@@ ders when they go through the streets . &quot;
&quot; for me this is as if they ridi@@ cul@@ ed those who have lost someone , and those who are afraid that something happens to them . &quot;
I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a stati@@ stic .
&quot; people &apos;s hop@@ el@@ essness is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village should be justified , that they were &quot; &quot; so@@ aked &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I think they try to convince themselves that they remain spar@@ ed from such trage@@ dies , if they do not stir and remain silent . &quot;
&quot; Mari@@ bel L. from Mexico City wrote the article &quot; Four months black@@ mail in the main town district : how a family was sack@@ ed with threats . &quot; &quot;
you think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days .
&quot; the pain of this never passes away , the trauma remains , the fear comes up again when you are alone . &quot;
&quot; habits have changed , phone numbers too . &quot;
we only contact us if it is absolutely necessary .
&quot; the farther we are from each other , the better . &quot;
she closed her report with the words :
&quot; we want others to be arrested , because you don &apos;t know when they will kidn@@ ap you or kill you . &quot;
&quot; I asked myself in these terrible days whether tears would dissolve my deep @-@ rooted feelings , but the answer is no , because I forgot how to we@@ ep . I must learn to live with the pain . &quot;
the journalist Mario Gu@@ ti@@ Ã©r@@ rez Vega has published the article &quot; The forgotten children of Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez : a generation drawn by violence . &quot;
in the introduction he raises questions like : who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime ?
how is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico ?
&quot; he is not like other boys of his age , whose parents care about them . &quot;
&quot; Br@@ yan is a orph@@ an and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg , cook potatoes , make tor@@ till@@ as warm and &quot; chi@@ chi &quot; for the babies who live with it . this is his name for preparing the bottles with water , sugar and milk powder . &quot;
he tells of the nine sc@@ ars on his left leg - one for each year of life .
but they are in@@ significant compared to the pain in his eyes - un@@ speak@@ ably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it .
&quot; when he was five years old , he told him that his mother had disappeared . &quot;
but this was not the day when his childhood ended .
&quot; his childhood was past two years before , when he was just a few blocks from his home , who saw the bloody corp@@ se of his father shot by armed men from a passing car . &quot;
when Br@@ yan was born the situation in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez looked like this :
Br@@ yan was born in 2006 when violence through organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was missing .
&quot; in 2008 , 2009 and 2010 , Ju@@ Ã¡@@ rez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of mur@@ ders according to the Public Security Council and the Government of the United States Government . &quot;
&quot; in 2010 alone , the Public Prosecutor &apos;s Office amounted to 3@@ 103 Mor@@ de . this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mor@@ des per day . &quot;
these are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country .
only a few stories live in the face of ever new head@@ lines . but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget .
&quot; in addition to the project &quot; &quot; A@@ pr@@ ender a Vi@@ vir C@@ on El Nar@@ co &quot; , &quot; Animal Pol@@ Ã­@@ ti@@ co launched the data journ@@ alism project Nar@@ co@@ data , whose goal is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking , which has tortured the country in the last four decades . &quot;
when a picture is worth a thousand un@@ true words
sharing is Car@@ ing &quot; by the Fli@@ ck@@ r user Ni@@ kl@@ as Wi@@ k@@ strÃ¶m ( CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 ) W@@ AR@@ N@@ TION : this post and the pages to which it links contain images on which violence is represented .
fact check is important at a moment when it comes to raising a rum@@ or or revealing a for@@ gery .
&quot; but what happened after the first time ? content in social media , whether true or un@@ true , tends to continue to exist . &quot;
let us take this photograph of a terrible accident seven years ago in the Democratic Republic of Congo ( DR Congo ) .
&quot; since its initial release , it has been used mis@@ leading to portra@@ y trage@@ dies that have actually occurred in Nigeria or Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; this false coupling of picture and event - &quot; false description &quot; or &quot; false context &quot; in the terminology of Global Vo@@ ices or First Dra@@ ft News - does not deny the fact that there are plenty of careful coverage of events in DR Congo , Myanmar and Nigeria . &quot;
but it raises questions about our desire for pictures to news .
what happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo
&quot; in 2010 a tan@@ ker crossed the town of S@@ ange in the east of the DR Congo , til@@ ted and explo@@ ded . 230 people lost their lives . &quot;
&quot; after the civil war , Africa &apos;s second largest country had been neglected for years and devast@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; tra@@ gically , the tank wagon fell victim to death . &quot;
&quot; dign@@ it@@ aries described a fire@@ ball that envel@@ oped dozens of houses , including a cinem@@ as nearby , which was full of people watching the football world championship . &quot;
houses burned and char@@ ted corp@@ ses were scattered in the streets .
many people were burned to the unknown .
&quot; an image with the title &quot; &quot; This is Nigeria &quot; . &quot; from Im@@ g@@ ur user Mysti@@ cal Monkey , 12th January 201@@ 5.@@ Sever@@ al photos of the incident will form the horrible scenes this day . &quot;
above is an example of this .
&quot; it shows rows of char@@ red bodies , lined up on the ground while watching them . &quot;
but here the story does not end .
&quot; over the years the same photo was taken up several times on social media , blogs and other platforms and fal@@ sely attributed to real but not related trage@@ dies , especially events in Nigeria and Myanmar . &quot;
what happened in Nigeria and Myanmar
&quot; on 3 January 2015 , B@@ oko Har@@ am attacked the remote Nig@@ eri@@ an villages of Bag@@ a and Dor@@ o G@@ ow@@ on . &quot;
e@@ ye@@ witnesses reported dr@@ astically of atro@@ cities in which they had to flee .
houses and shops were burned down and dead bodies lay in streets and bushes .
&quot; there were reports , according to which 150 to 2,000 people were massac@@ red . &quot;
&quot; but the figures could not be confirmed . &quot; &quot; no one remained behind to count corp@@ ses , &quot; &quot; said one of the inhabitants of Human Rights Watch . &quot;
&quot; many had been sh@@ attered , shot or burned . &quot;
&quot; only on the basis of satellite images , the following time could be visually displayed . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the attack was also unclear , but the army base in Bag@@ a was a permanent conflict between the military Nigeria and the attempt by B@@ oko Har@@ am to win land ( examples from 2013 and 2015 ) . &quot;
&quot; and here the picture from the DR Congo showed up again , when it was fal@@ sely presented as proof of the fact and the possible extent of the attack : &quot;
this is Nigeria .
&quot; a massacre of 2,000 people took place two days after Paris . &quot;
they are not Charlie .
they are dead .
&quot; in fact , this ab@@ u@@ sive use of the image from the DR Congo is only one in a number of abor@@ tions ; Africa Check has documented assignments to Nigeria since 2014 . &quot;
&quot; in all these cases , the picture was presented as proof of mass kill@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; one step further , personal comments like this example fal@@ sely relate the image of the DR Congo with sources of mass media in order to deliver arguments . &quot;
the image from S@@ ange also appeared in connection with the deadly persecution of the Muslim Roh@@ ing@@ ya in Myanmar .
&quot; according to a lightning announcement , published by the United Nations , those who could flee could strike blows , rape and several dead , some by burning . &quot;
&quot; while others reported about the violence against the Roh@@ ing@@ ya , Po@@ sts like the following , who brought these descriptions together with photos from the DR Congo : &quot;
&quot; this picture comes from an aci@@ dic @-@ Arab message , wrong@@ ly claimed in 2012 , the President of Burma Th@@ ein have said that monks and politicians have participated in the murder of Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . additionally , she had used the image from the DR Congo to view this information . &quot;
&quot; the original contribution , which was recently accessed on April 26 , 2017 , can be accessed here . &quot;
&quot; other news agencies , named AF@@ P as their source , had also fal@@ sely attributed th@@ ein to this statement , but did not associate the image of the DR Congo . &quot;
the worldwide range of false information
traces of these false coupl@@ ings extend back to the years 2011 and 2012 and are actually coming from all over the world .
&quot; with the help of an &quot; reverse image search , &quot; you can see how far information can exceed limits . &quot;
a reverse picture search with the search engine Tin@@ Eye has found 3@@ 44 pictures below 18.@@ 8 billion images ( as of 3 May 2017 ) 3@@ 44 pictures that are very similar to the said image from the DR Congo .
&quot; they come from a mixed mass of private pages , platforms of social media and community as well as national publications and are available in many different languages such as English , Russian , Spanish , Arabic , Dutch , German , Greek and Portuguese . &quot;
&quot; some have passed wrong reports , some have attempted to expose the fal@@ si@@ fications . &quot;
&quot; we have del@@ im@@ ited examples of mis@@ use and linked them to the respective countries , on the basis of what they were published on which side they were published . by this we want to display the range more clearly than by language alone . &quot;
&quot; from the countries listed below ( which in some cases are also connected with each other ) , several examples may be used for mis@@ use . &quot;
here are some cases which can now be completely detected ( on the card in orange ) :

the orange countries point to pages or servers that are still available for examples of for@@ geri@@ es or false noti@@ fications .

&quot; as a reminder , the source of the image is the Democratic Republic of Congo ( in blue ) . &quot;
&quot; Algeria , 2012 . &quot; what happens in Burma - Myanmar ? &quot; a link to the image from the DR Congo was posted in an online discussion forum ( addressed to Algeri@@ ans and interested Arabs ) as part of a thread to the &quot; War of Budd@@ hi@@ sts against Muslims . &quot; &quot;

&quot; Myanmar , 2017 . &quot;

the article was updated in 2014 and the image continues to contain it at the time of this publication .
&quot; Spain , 2015 / 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this 2014 article about students who had been killed by B@@ oko Har@@ am published by the now deleted , the Catholic close to the news page An@@ Ã¡@@ l@@ is@@ is Digital , has expressly declared that the image does not come from the kill@@ ings , but it claims that there is a &quot; &quot; similar jihadi@@ st attack &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; when the picture later came into circulation in connection with the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre , the newspaper El Pa@@ is tried to refu@@ te that there were connections to Nigeria . &quot;

&quot; the image of the DR Congo showed , with this T@@ wit@@ ter@@ h@@ ash@@ tag , triggered a discussion among Muslims following the massacre of B@@ oko Har@@ am in 2015 and the attack on Charlie Heb@@ do in Paris . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to achieve a greater attention to these events , presum@@ ed in the name of Islam . &quot;
&quot; United States , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; the image was weather@@ ed as evidence of the B@@ oko Har@@ am massacre in 2015 ( and more than 9,@@ 300 times ) . but the messages that were associated with it were not taken up in any religious context . &quot;
&quot; instead , the goal was to pay attention to the relative number of deaths and a comparison of media coverage compared to Nigeria and the attack against Charlie Heb@@ do . &quot;
&quot; Vietnam ( Portuguese ) , 2014 . &quot;
&quot; after a message allegedly written by a &quot; &quot; Fr . Juan Carlos Mar@@ tos &quot; &quot; about the Nig@@ eri@@ an massacre , there were discussion forums like this here in Vietnam@@ ese and declared it a false report . &quot;

&quot; there are other confirmed examples of incorrect use of the image from Sweden , Poland , Belgium , the Netherlands and Argentina . &quot;
&quot; Tin@@ Eye also points to other accounts , ag@@ gregation and sites in the following countries ( on the portfolio in Gra@@ u ) but are no longer fully trac@@ eable : Czech Republic , Australia , India , Peru , Netherlands , Ethiopia , Sri Lanka , Azerbaijan , Japan and possibly China . &quot;
( data entries with URLs and time / date stamps exist on the craw@@ ler and occasionally they have image file names in connection with Nigeria or Roh@@ ing@@ ya Muslims . )
&quot; in all these cases , which appeared clearly after the original date of 2010 , the picture may ultimately be a correct description , but the original contribution is not available or accessible . &quot;
frames and pictures
there are two strong themes or frames ( fra@@ ming ) that perme@@ ate these posts . the first frame focuses on religion .
the photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assass@@ ination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assass@@ ination of the Roh@@ ing@@ y@@ as by Budd@@ hi@@ sts .
a second fra@@ ming uses the picture to discuss how an African life is under@@ valued in comparison with a European or French life .
&quot; to understand religion and the value of human life is important . therefore , it is worth investigating how images are used in connection with these efforts . &quot;
&quot; a deeper issue , however , is what happens when readers can no longer believe these images . &quot;
&quot; with social media , there are tens of people who acci@@ dentally share the water around a tragedy . &quot;
&quot; suggests this sen@@ timent of false and false information that actual atro@@ cities are un@@ true and makes it the real horror of what has actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo , Nigeria and Myanmar ? &quot;
the spread of violent images has already been extensively deb@@ ated ( for example ) .
&quot; one argument is that with@@ holding images of a refusal is equivalent to recognizing the tragedy . sometimes , these images are even demanded by the victims themselves . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , the concern is that violent ima@@ gery will des@@ en@@ si@@ ti@@ ze readers and viewers and take the ability to feel emp@@ athy ( such as this study , which investig@@ ates how violent media work on helping others ) . &quot;
&quot; while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media , the fact is that they are indispensable for today &apos;s news reporting . &quot;
&quot; techn@@ ologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against &quot; &quot; fake news &quot; . &quot; they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something , but what actually can be used from context or completely ab@@ u@@ sive nature . &quot;
&quot; however , any examination of false attri@@ butions should also take into account how international they can be . &quot;

the &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; blog reveals the uniqu@@ eness of smaller languages
photo by Andy Sim@@ mons uses according to CC B@@ Y @-@ ND 2.0 license .
&quot; a blog called un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able ( e.g. irre@@ plac@@ eable ) tries to offer language enthusiasts a selection of words from all over the world , which are difficult or not to translate at all . &quot;
such words exist in each language : they express certain situations or feelings that are often very complex or specific .
&quot; some of these irre@@ plac@@ eable words are already well known today ( like the famous Portuguese sau@@ da@@ de ) and others , which are deeply rooted in a special culture ( for example , the Spanish so@@ bre@@ w ) . &quot;
but all resist stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly every attempt of a simple translation .
&quot; a word or expression does not suff@@ ice , which is why a complete explanation and sometimes some context are necessary to understand exactly what is meant with this one word . &quot;
these unique words have been collected for quite a while in an online list .
&quot; most of these lists deal with Japanese , German , French , Portuguese or Finnish words , while the author and lingu@@ ist of &quot; un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able &quot; Steven Bird decided to concentrate on small languages . &quot;
&quot; for example , in the blog you can find words from the VAT @-@ cla@@ p language of Van@@ u@@ atu , such as : &quot;
&quot; v@@ ak@@ ast@@ eg@@ lo@@ k &quot; - Ref@@ er to your parents in recognition of how they have stri@@ ved around you in your recent years .
&quot; words in the H@@ uns@@ wick language spoken in parts of Brazil , such as : &quot;
k@@ w@@ adi &quot; - The comfort or la@@ z@@ iness you feel after getting war@@ med in the sun on cold days .
in Bir@@ ds own words from his blog About :
&quot; they def@@ use other cultures , reveal other thoughts and ar@@ ouse our curiosity . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you influence how we analyze and classi@@ fy the world around us and classi@@ fy the lingu@@ ists on this site , and show how different , valuable and impressive these small languages are . &quot;
&quot; speakers of Treas@@ ure Langu@@ ages , which are highly appreciated by un@@ trans@@ lat@@ able , are invited to upload their favorite performers here . &quot;

how Sri Lanka eng@@ ages with the worst floo@@ ding catastrophe in the decade
the island state of Sri Lanka is currently facing the worst flood disaster in this decade .
&quot; caused by heavy rainf@@ alls , the Kal@@ u , Kel@@ ani , G@@ in , Nil@@ agi@@ a and At@@ tan@@ ag@@ al@@ u O@@ ya have entered the south and west of the country through strong rainf@@ alls in 15 districts in the south and west of the country . &quot;
&quot; following an opinion of the Sri Lanka catastrophe centre of 28 May 2017 , 126 people were killed and barely hundreds of people were missed because of the floo@@ ding and mud wave . &quot;
&quot; more than 400 000 people have been affected since last Friday ( 26 May ) and about 100,000 people were brought to 30@@ 4 safe locations . &quot;
&quot; the ra@@ ins left on Saturday ( May 27 ) , and the water stands in some areas slowly decreased . &quot;
health and hygiene conditions of the population pose a massive challenge in the affected and still in@@ accessible areas .
the following pictures and videos give an impression of the magnitude of the flood disaster :
floods in Ta@@ wal@@ ama city with water bo@@ oths of up to 7.5 meters . Twitter users like A@@ zz@@ am A@@ me@@ en and Sri Lanka T@@ we@@ et supply regular updates to the flood situation .
many use the h@@ ash@@ tag # F@@ loo@@ d@@ SL to monitor the scale of the disaster .
&quot; Sri Lanka &apos;s deadly floods exac@@ erb@@ ate the Den@@ gue fever crisis , Save the Children , after further rainf@@ alls are already on the way . &quot;
&quot; today , the N@@ elu@@ wa bus stood in the flood water , water level up to 6 meters . village of Mor@@ ago@@ da near G@@ alle also flooded because of the water p@@ ic of the Mor@@ o@@ go@@ da El@@ a last night . &quot;
the Air Force provided five planes for rescue operations and another five are being prepared for the transport of emergency supplies for the residents included in their flooded villages .
various organizations and startups are also willing to help .
Facebook sites such as Help Flo@@ od Vic@@ tims in Sri Lanka and 2017 Dis@@ aster Relief - Information Des@@ k@@ - Sri Lanka provide important information on flood situation and humanitarian aid .
&quot; if any search and rescue teams need dr@@ ones for their operations , please call 0@@ 77@@ 48@@ 4@@ 46@@ 39 . &quot;
for all who want to don@@ ate dry foods and essential goods for flood victims -
today we are in the area around Kel@@ eni@@ ya and Him@@ hal@@ ana .
&quot; please call the number 0@@ 77@@ 7@@ 44@@ 97@@ 29 or 0@@ 77@@ 78@@ 4@@ 38@@ 41 today , if animals in this area need help . &quot;
the taxi call @-@ App Pick@@ Me ( Sri Lanka ) asks anxious people to share their location data with the help of the app so that the Kat@@ ast@@ oph@@ en@@ entrum will be informed .
&quot; last year after the disaster of the tropical storm Ro@@ an@@ u , Pick@@ Me introduced a &quot; flood aid &quot; button that allowed users to call a vehicle for picking up assistance and donations . these were then distributed free to the Sri L@@ ank@@ an Red Cross . &quot;
&quot; they also introduced a &quot; S@@ OS &quot; button , which resulted in more than a thousand requests and 150 successful boat rescue operations for people trapped by floods and land@@ slides . &quot;
&quot; the combined efforts of the government and civilian populations of Sri Lanka , where multiple social media platforms are fully exploited , bring people in need of security and make aid . &quot;
&quot; this has prevented the loss of further human lives , while the population of Sri Lanka is now facing the long path to the restoration of norm@@ ality . &quot;

&quot; use approved . in January , I took part in the Women &apos;s March in San Francisco with a neighbour and love friend . &quot;
&quot; I trust her four years old daughter , she tru@@ sts me her children ; she is my rock in the fire . &quot;
&quot; in one minute , we still call for slo@@ gans for women &apos;s rights . &quot;
&quot; in the next , we have rights for trans@@ gender . &quot;
&quot; we are in a sea of umbr@@ ellas and people , some keep the iconic picture of a woman with head@@ sc@@ arf high , tied from an American flag , other gu@@ essing slo@@ gans against anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
&quot; my girlfriend looks at me and says , &quot; &quot; These things do not concern you , or ? &quot; &quot; why , because I am not Muslim ? &quot; &quot; I ask . &quot;
I have already managed this conversation .
&quot; people with whom I work or people who have known me for years , separate me - the Sah@@ ar they know - from the widespread concept of &quot; &quot; Muslims &quot; &quot; that have built up in their imagination . &quot;
they have mus@@ cul@@ ed me .
there are 1.7 billion Muslims worldwide .
we do not see all alike .
we practice our religion differently .
we identify with it to be a Muslim in different ways . but somehow we are all put into the same Muslim drawer .
&quot; this drawer is designed in our collective imagination so well that as soon as Muslims , who don &apos;t fit like me there , are becoming Muslim . &quot;
has to be mus@@ cul@@ li@@ zed
I &apos;m not alone .
this has even happened to the poet whose poetry is most sold in America : Rum@@ i .
what pictures do you get in mind when you think of him ?
love ?
peace ?
&quot; as Jal@@ alu@@ d@@ din Rum@@ i was as old as I am now , he was an Orthodox Muslim pre@@ acher and schol@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; Islam , the Quran and Prophet Muhammad were the center of his poetry until the day when he died . &quot;
&quot; but in the Western conception , the religion of Rum@@ is was extingu@@ ished , as well as from the most popular translations of his poetry . &quot;
this del@@ eting makes a great deal of the history of the 1.7 billion Muslims of this world .
&quot; another consists of the reduc@@ tion@@ ist images of Muslims , which have been colon@@ izing Western books for centuries . &quot;
this temp@@ ting language is determined by the dark man you should fear and the exotic woman you should save .
the ground@@ breaking Palestinian @-@ American scientist Edward S@@ aid tore the story behind these images in the 1970s .
but these pictures continue to prot@@ ru@@ de today .
&quot; our politicians , the news industry and Hollywood continue to dis@@ continue them . &quot;
&quot; I have worked in the news industry for thirteen years , and I have seen how these powerful , fla@@ wed nar@@ r@@ atives dominate our news@@ feeds . &quot;
&quot; this narrative over@@ shadows the reality that has led to nine Muslim women in the last three decades , while the US could not even elect their first female presidential candidate in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; this narrative fails to recognise that when French Muslim women are prevented from wearing their head@@ sc@@ arf in public buildings and forced Saudi @-@ Arab Muslim women to cover their entire body , these are both sides of the same coin . &quot;
a powerful group ex@@ erts its &quot; control &quot; to the &quot; other . &quot;
this strong Nar@@ r@@ ative weak@@ ens Muslim women who lead movements for change .
&quot; it seems that the first Muslim prayers were spoken on American soil by Afri@@ cans , which were hi@@ jack@@ ed up with slave ships . &quot;
it del@@ etes the existence of que@@ er Muslims .
&quot; this narrative has taken our collective imagination so deeply and in@@ correctly , that often Si@@ kh @-@ men and children are becoming the target of anti @-@ Muslim attacks and ch@@ ic@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; because of these stories that we tell and because of the way we tell them , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not just fear of Islam , religion , but fear of the &quot; others . &quot; &quot;
to the 1.7 billion include
&quot; in the news industry , we do more than just telling stories that are based on facts . &quot;
or on alternative facts .
we also create narr@@ atives that help us to understand the world .
and my industry has failed to capture the narrative of 1.7 billion .
&quot; and we have failed here , where seven million Muslims are the highest &quot; &quot; diverse &quot; &quot; religious group in America . &quot;
more than a third of the Muslim population are African @-@ racial Americans .
six out of ten American Muslims are among the first generation immigrants coming from 77 countries .

four decades ago my immig@@ rant parents arrived in New York to live their American dream .
&quot; my mother placed her first jewellery design on 5th Avenue and my father worked hard in the sky@@ scra@@ pers of New York ; sky@@ scra@@ pers were made possible by the Muslim , American St@@ ati@@ ker from Bangladesh with the name Faz@@ l@@ ur Rah@@ man Khan . &quot;
&quot; at that time , when Khan had re@@ considered the world &apos;s sky@@ lines , my parents were un@@ seen Muslims and Americans . &quot;
but am I now a Muslim and an American ?
&quot; sometimes when people ask me why I don &apos;t eat pork , I say - instead of bringing out my Muslim recipes or my hand@@ some hand@@ ker@@ chief , which all Muslims carry with themselves - &quot; out of respect for P@@ epp@@ a W@@ utz . &quot;
&quot; I j@@ ester , we don &apos;t carry all the hand@@ ker@@ chiefs with us . &quot;
we don &apos;t have to be the@@ ological experts to be &quot; Muslim &quot; or to be almost always selected for additional security checks at the airport .
&quot; there are hundreds of prominent Muslim scholars , Muslim activists and inter@@ religious activists who try to fight widespread fal@@ seh@@ oods about Islam . &quot;
&quot; these lies are produced on the current tape of a well @-@ lubri@@ cated Islam@@ opho@@ bia machine with don@@ ors , think tanks and experts for false information , which have already manipul@@ ated our already er@@ ron@@ eous image of what a Muslim is , or what Islam is . &quot;
&quot; because of the stories we tell and because of the way we talk about it , Islam@@ opho@@ bia is more than just a stranger , who tears the head@@ sc@@ arf on a woman . &quot;

I would like to explain this .
&quot; I was born as a Muslim , but to be a Muslim was born only then in my imagination when I was four years old , in a temporary mosque in the basement of a pres@@ by@@ ter@@ ian church in New York . &quot;
&quot; when social scientists describe religious life , they fall back to the following terms : faith , behavior and affili@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith and behavior may not always be visible , but they are there . &quot;
&quot; perhaps my girlfriend , my neighbour , my neighbour , would see my rock in the surge that I am Muslims when they could look through the 15 meters of concrete and air that separate our houses . &quot;
&quot; she would see the ni@@ gh@@ tly ritual with my daughter , when I was silent in my arms and whis@@ pered the Arab verses to the protection that seal the Qur &apos;an and called the Q@@ ul@@ s . &quot;
each of them I repeat three times .
&quot; I ask that it is protected from evil , the evil one can see and the evil one cannot see . &quot;
&quot; my Muslim faith may not always be visible , but my Muslim affili@@ ation is always part of my shadow . &quot;

belonging is the picture of my grandmother mat@@ ernal with her sisters ; as she decades ago gained a competition of the art of flower arrangement in Kar@@ achi .
&quot; it is the picture of her that I see at this moment when I close my eyes : nano , surrounded by her completed and incomplete paintings painted Su@@ fi @-@ saint ; and a Qur &apos;an with many book@@ marks , a book with one hundred and fourteen chapters , which she can almost mem@@ ori@@ ze . &quot;
to be Muslims means to speak the prayers that she had told me when I had a bad day .
&quot; to be Muslims is how they taught me to relate to God : Allah Mi@@ an , what God means , my only Lord . &quot;
&quot; for a people who - for centuries - had been colon@@ ised by an &quot; empire &quot; which a company founded with the name Ehr@@ worthy Bri@@ tische Ost@@ ini@@ dien @-@ Kom@@ pan@@ ie , it has a deep meaning to name God , my only Lord . &quot;

&quot; belonging means to grow up and hear that men do not we@@ ep , but at the same time to see that my immig@@ rant grandfather we@@ eps . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , while he writes books about modern Islam and the independence of K@@ ash@@ mir , N@@ ana Ja@@ an wept over his family in K@@ ash@@ mir , family , which he was not allowed to close in half a century . &quot;
&quot; belonging is to know that there are millions of Kur@@ ds and Palestinians , whose families , like my grandfather , have been torn apart by col@@ oni@@ alists who have shared the Muslim world as at the game risk . &quot;
&quot; to be Muslims means knowing that over the last two centuries , Europeans have &quot; &quot; colonial &quot; &quot; all to four Muslim countries . &quot;
it means knowing that the first aerial bombar@@ d@@ ment of history was dis@@ car@@ ded over a Muslim country a century ago .
&quot; it means knowing that at the same time the grandfather of my grandmother , an Indian , K@@ ash@@ mir@@ a sub@@ tan of the British empire , was referred to as &quot; dangerous &quot; by the newspapers of his time , as he led the first mosque in England . &quot;
&quot; before there were planes , he travelled into more parts of the world than I was ever and preaching the radical word of love , peace and social justice . &quot;

to belong to my Muslim tribe of the 1.7 billion goes deep into our unforgettable family trees ; our un@@ acknowledged history .
&quot; it means remembering that fourteen years ago , the most powerful military in the world , with troops distributed across every continent apart from Antar@@ cti@@ ca , went to Iraq to pursue mass destruction weapons that did not exist . &quot;
it means knowing that more than half million Ira@@ q@@ is are buried under the ruins of the war .
&quot; to be an American Muslim , it means knowing that the suicide rate among veter@@ ans has increased by more than 32 percent since 2001 . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that when a tragedy takes home the US and the suspect bears a Muslim name , history is reported four times more than a story with a white assass@@ ination attempt . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that fourteen hundred years ago the first prayer call , the Az@@ aan , was called by a liberated black slave with the name Bil@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it means knowing that two hundred years ago , an African Islamic schol@@ ar named Bil@@ ali Mohammed was ens@@ la@@ ved and brought to this country . &quot;
it means calling Mal@@ col@@ m X an American hero .
it is the warmth that I feel when people crowded the airports to fight against the Muslim Ban .
it is the hope that I feel when we get up for our dreams and when we say black life .
&quot; to be an American , a Pak@@ ist@@ ani woman , a P@@ ah@@ ari , a Pun@@ j@@ ab@@ i , a Muslim , and a journalist , means the inherent inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality of our identi@@ ties with multiple d@@ ashes , but to fail to communicate it to others . &quot;
&quot; the narrative of the 1.7 billion hides more possibilities than a magic cube , but is represented in the reducing doubts &quot; we &quot; against &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to be a mother means to care for my child and all Muslim children , knowing that powerful and privileged people build structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility . &quot;
structural anti @-@ Islam hos@@ tility is in the Muslim regi@@ stra@@ r that started with President Bush and extended under President Obama .
it consists of continuous monitoring of mos@@ ques .
&quot; it consists of immigration officers , who takes a five @-@ year @-@ old child in hand@@ cu@@ ffs . &quot;
it is in a country that limits its borders to people from just the countries that bom@@ bed it .
&quot; it is a false and ne@@ bul@@ ous &quot; &quot; No @-@ Fly list &quot; , &quot; which mostly refers to Arabs and Muslims . &quot;
it is the wars that we lead and the bombs we throw on Muslim lands .
&quot; because of the stories that we tell and because of those we don &apos;t tell , we are here today . &quot;
&quot; in a study entitled A@@ scent of Man , scientists from the Nor@@ th@@ western University showed a scientifically accurate picture and asked them to evaluate groups on a scale from 1 to 100 with regard to evolution . &quot;
Muslims received the lowest score .
the conversations that we have to lead
we are too deep into enth@@ r@@ alling the Muslim or the &quot; others . &quot;
&quot; we stand back for decades , to recognise the roots of our fears and the er@@ ron@@ eous and dangerous forms of expression that we have in our news agencies . &quot;
&quot; at least there is a growing movement , led by American Muslims in the media industry , trying to capture our multiple identi@@ ties and forgotten history many times . &quot;
&quot; the Pod@@ cast lake Som@@ e@@ thing , Sa@@ y Som@@ e@@ thing by Bu@@ zz@@ feed ; the viral video series Secret Li@@ ves of Muslims ; Sap@@ elo Square via black , American Muslims ; Simon &amp; amp ; Schu@@ sters Sal@@ am Re@@ ads , an initiative to increase Muslim authors and Ms Mar@@ vel , the PA@@ K@@ IS@@ TA@@ N@@ IS@@ CH , Muslim , American super@@ hero - all this makes me hope . &quot;

col@@ lage of the author .
but I am concerned about this difficult global timing in which we are .
&quot; and this moment has consequences , which go beyond the 1.7 billion . &quot;
&quot; there is one reason that conspiracy the@@ orists who existed in the dark corners of the Internet , now lead the White House . &quot;
they have grown expon@@ enti@@ ally because they have made Muslims &quot; others . &quot;
another group that has grown expon@@ enti@@ ally by creating the &quot; other . &quot;
&quot; a few years earlier , it had not yet been given ; now they dominate large areas in Syria and Iraq . &quot;
&quot; I am concerned about the realities and the history that I was not aware of when I was as old as it is now my daughter , but who made me an irre@@ vo@@ cable Muslim today . &quot;
things I left here like a bread@@ crum@@ b in my speech .
&quot; things that may aw@@ aken memories , for in all the inter@@ sections that constitutes our humanity , there may be a story where someone is made to another . &quot;
&quot; right now , on the other side of the Berkeley bridge , conversations are taking place during the 8th Annual Conference on Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
&quot; more than a hundred academ@@ ics speak about our problems with the &quot; &quot; other &quot; , &quot; &quot; structural racism &quot; and &quot; American militar@@ ism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , these are not terms that we usually do in our schools around us or which we read in our newspapers . &quot;
poster of the Facebook page of the Islam@@ opho@@ bia studies network .
we all have to ask ourselves why ?
&quot; why do I tell this here at this TE@@ D@@ x Talk 2017 in Stan@@ ford , where yet Edward S@@ aid , the man who showed us how wars are being led and people were enth@@ r@@ alled by creating the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; in public performance four decades ago was even a scientist of Stan@@ ford . &quot;
&quot; we have to ask ourselves uncomfortable questions about the role of being consciously and un@@ consciously the &quot; &quot; other &quot; &quot; ; as my girlfriend and I do in the rain during the Women &apos;s March , because the employment that we have no President , while he already bom@@ bed countries and &quot; &quot; to other &quot; &quot; people , goes far beyond the visible and invisible 1.7 billion . &quot;
it starts here with all of us .
initiative for narrative art wants to preserve urban diversity
&quot; tell stories of history , by Fli@@ ck@@ r user Daniel@@ e Rossi , using the license CC B@@ Y @-@ NC @-@ ND 2.0 . &quot;
can there be a possibility to contact someone here and now despite a language barrier ?
&quot; for Steven Bird and Rob@@ yn Per@@ ry , founder of the Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling ( T@@ LS ) initiative , the creation of stories in their original language is a possible answer . &quot;
&quot; global Vo@@ ices reported recently about another initiative by Steven Bird , the irre@@ plac@@ eable blog . &quot;
&quot; here , however , the focus of T@@ LS is not on the written , but on the spoken word . it is an attempt to preserve and honor the diversity of languages of large cities . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in O@@ ak@@ land in the United States , where T@@ LS has held events since 2015 , the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there . &quot;
for the makers of the project :
the mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents don &apos;t have to forget who they are to belong .
&quot; while listening to it is often connected to &quot; understanding &quot; these events instead &quot; listening , to appreciate , to feel . &quot;
&quot; in this format , history narr@@ ators first introduce and translate their story in their own language and then explain them in English . &quot;
&quot; even if the participants are not professional stor@@ yt@@ ellers , their devotion and representation will lead to the audience . &quot;
they evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier .
&quot; the following video shows , for example , a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language Daf@@ ing . during this round , the stor@@ yt@@ eller R@@ assi@@ dat@@ ou Kon@@ ate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country . &quot;
&quot; in another event , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara tells the story of the h@@ are and the b@@ abo@@ on in the language Sh@@ ona of Zimbabwe : &quot;
&quot; after explaining the meaning of his ability , John Ny@@ amus@@ ara is asked : &quot; how is this to speak to an audience that doesn &apos;t understand your language ? &quot; with a broad smile , he shares his sense of inclu@@ si@@ veness : &quot;
you listened to it !
they were attentive ...
they were with me !
&quot; so far , the events of Treas@@ ure Language Stor@@ y@@ telling have taken place in three cities , and the organisers hope to expand this . all who are inspired by the project can contact T@@ LS to organize their own history stories . &quot;
Puerto Rico calls for the US re @-@ tigh@@ tening of sovereign debt
&quot; with the aim of a re @-@ examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico , which took place at 72 million US dollars , several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017 ; the march took place in the capit@@ ol of the capital , and went down to Plaza de Col@@ Ã³n in the old town of San Ju@@ an . &quot;

this is their demand :
&quot; the people Puerto Ri@@ cos demand that politicians , bank@@ ers and government agencies responsible for the debts are responsible for their corruption . &quot;

&quot; the island , not incorporated into the state alliance of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis . &quot;

these are their reasons :
the economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ri@@ cos requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure .

&quot; the sy@@ ric @-@ Palestinian web developer Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi , has been missing for over a year . &quot;
but he is not forgotten .
&quot; more than five years after he was arrested by the Syrian regime , his supporters and members continue the campaign for his freedom and recall the contributions he made for an open network . &quot;
&quot; at this year &apos;s re : Pub@@ lica , the annual conference on digital culture , which is organised in Berlin , was dedicated to the # Free@@ ver@@ Bass@@ el campaign . &quot;
&quot; MÃ©@@ lan@@ ie Dul@@ ong de Ros@@ nay , a scientist of the CN@@ RS Institute for Communication Sciences , and Barbara R@@ Ã¼h@@ ling , managing director of Book S@@ prints , a publishing house of the book Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Inqu@@ iry ( The Cost of Freedom : a Collec@@ tive Research ) . &quot;
&quot; the book , which was published last year and is available roy@@ alty free , contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression . &quot;
it is a tribute to Bass@@ el and his work .
in the introduction it is said :
&quot; this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built , and what are the real costs associated with . &quot;
&quot; activists , artists , designers , developers , researchers and authors , who are involved in the movement for free knowledge , have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our news@@ feeds and to create some sense of our various experiences . &quot;
&quot; this book is an attempt to free Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il , the beloved and celebrated internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15 , 2012 . &quot;
&quot; his name was cancelled out of the directory of the A@@ dra Pr@@ ison in which he sat on October 3 , 2015 . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have no information about his current state or where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; the introductory part of his book entitled &quot; &quot; Collec@@ tive Memory &quot; &quot; gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom , instantly . &quot;
&quot; seeing how Bass@@ el pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own dest@@ ini@@ es , actions and decisions . &quot;
why are we here today ?
what did we decide for ?
what have we given up at times of extreme convic@@ tions in this process ?
the web developer for open source and digital assets has been in detention for Syrian government agencies since March 2012 .
&quot; in October 2015 , Bass@@ el from the A@@ dra prison , a non @-@ military institution , was transferred to an unknown place . &quot;
&quot; his wife , writer and lawyer N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i , reported that the &quot; military police Bass@@ el had taken on the basis of a &quot; strictly secret &quot; command of the military tribunal from his cell in A@@ dra . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i reported she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015 , who presented themselves as insi@@ ders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband . &quot;
&quot; however , his place of residence and condition remains unknown . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el played a key role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria . &quot;
&quot; Barry Th@@ re@@ w , a designer , techn@@ ologist , and currently the director of New Pal@@ my@@ ra , a project that founded Bass@@ el , writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book : &quot;
perhaps none of Bas@@ que &apos;s cultural prototypes was more for@@ esi@@ ghted than the work he started with a group of archae@@ ologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually re@@ construct the ancient ruins of Pal@@ my@@ ra .
&quot; Pal@@ my@@ ra , one of the most important archaeological sites in the world , was the cross@@ roads of numerous civi@@ lizations . here , Greek @-@ Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences . &quot;
&quot; at that time Bass@@ el had not yet known that ten years after he began this work , the IS would make everything possible to wipe out this architecture , which em@@ bodies not only the cultural heritage of Sy@@ s@@ ri@@ ens but the world . &quot;
this move into digital archae@@ ology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future .
&quot; tra@@ gically , Bass@@ el could not finish this project yet . &quot;
N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i also contributed to the book and wrote about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison :
&quot; I spent my entire life to dream of freedom , and Bass@@ el taught me to embrace her . &quot;
I am overwhel@@ med if I call his name .
&quot; Bass@@ el taught me English , even when he was already in jail . &quot;
&quot; I learned to read , write and speak English well . &quot;
&quot; he always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked . he taught other prisoners to read , write and speak English . &quot;
Bass@@ el opened the door to the technology for me . he taught me to use both computers and smartphones .
he brought me the internet .
&quot; he also taught other prisoners how they use computers , at least theoretically without actually holding them in their hands . &quot;
&quot; G@@ haz@@ i is also the author of Wa@@ iting ( Wa@@ iting ) , a pro@@ sab@@ book that she wrote to her husband in 2012 until 2015 when he was in custody . &quot;
Bass@@ el and N@@ our@@ a have worked together in the book for one year .
she smu@@ g@@ gled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English .
the book is available roy@@ alty @-@ free .
book envelope by Y@@ ous@@ se@@ f Ab@@ dal@@ ki .
the book is dedicated to the public domain .
here is an excerpt from the book of Nor@@ a entitled &quot; It is happening &quot; :
&quot; it happens during each visit , &quot;
&quot; that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes , &quot;
&quot; that I lose the contempl@@ ation in the moment we embrace , &quot;
&quot; that I don &apos;t care about any of the dangers , &quot;
&quot; each of the f@@ ences , sh@@ ac@@ kles and guards &quot;
I forget the thr@@ ong of the prison
and I enter every detail of your voice and words
&quot; when I am in love with me , &quot;
when your eyes say goodbye
and I will leave another piece of my soul with you ...
&quot; I quickly return to my lon@@ eliness , &quot;
&quot; to get back all the moments , &quot;
and to we@@ ep and smile about your absence .
I testify to myself that I will return soon ...
&quot; on the first anniversary of the incar@@ cer@@ ation of Bass@@ el , G@@ haz@@ i wrote : &quot;
&quot; one year passes , my soul &quot;
during the course of time
&quot; I am in your cage , &quot;
and you are still in the cage of monsters
Bash@@ ar &apos;s history is not unique in Syria .
&quot; since the beginning of protests in 2011 against the Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad regime , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights ( Syrian Network for Human Rights ) . &quot;
those arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tortured or even executed .
&quot; until 2016 , according to the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International , at least 17.@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in detention . &quot;
the stories of many other people remain unknown .
the Global Vo@@ ices Community has been calling for the release of Bass@@ el since 2012 .
we repeat our call today in the hope we have to do this for the last time .
&quot; Mos@@ ambique : due to corruption , the director res@@ igned after release on previous post . &quot;
&quot; Mozambique re@@ acted with anger to a corruption case in which a government member returned to work in the state machine after half of his sentence , in which corruption was committed . &quot;
&quot; this is Di@@ od@@ ino Cam@@ ba@@ za , who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010 , together with four other defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; the money came from public funds of Mozambique airports , whose advice was Cam@@ ba@@ za between 2005 and 2008 . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re @-@ adjustment to the company , which took place on April 19 . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a statement issued by the At@@ tor@@ ney General of the Republic that rejected the request , there would be no obstacle to Cam@@ ba@@ za to return to his old post , since the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings following his detention . &quot;
&quot; however , many inhabitants do not mean the action good . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with the Deutsche Welle , the Centre for Public Integr@@ ity ( Centro de Integ@@ ri@@ da@@ de P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lica , short C@@ IP ) , condemned the decision of the company to re @-@ establish the director in an interview with the Deutsche Welle : &quot;
&quot; represents a set@@ back in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a backward step towards the efforts of our legal system , such as the C@@ IP . &quot;
what we are aware of is that the company should also have directed a disciplinary procedure against the contrary .
&quot; however , the company apparently remained silent and did not make reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions . &quot;
&quot; Eg@@ Ã­@@ dio V@@ az , a major voice in the Moz@@ ambi@@ can social media , also re@@ jects this behaviour and considers the case as &quot; &quot; dispro@@ ved &quot; &quot; : &quot;
&quot; if Cam@@ ba@@ za would be a competent guy , he would be a consultant , after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been cut off . &quot;
&quot; he could give paid lectures and motiv@@ ating speeches , he could advise and polish his image . &quot;
&quot; but since he is in@@ competent , he agreed to be integrated into the company , which he helped to inflic@@ t harm . &quot;
&quot; consequently , it is obvious that Cam@@ ba@@ za is gladly paid for his silence . &quot;
disgu@@ sting !
&quot; bit@@ one Vi@@ age , young Mos@@ ambi@@ can and student of political science in Brazil says , the director has no moral : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za is rewarded by the state because he insul@@ ts him , I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already massi@@ vely offen@@ ded the state . &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za lacks mor@@ ale and to serve the state , * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state , but instead served itself only in the state . &quot;
Cam@@ ba@@ za used the state as though it was an in@@ exhaus@@ tible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was sum@@ mon@@ ed and finally sentenced to a long prison term .
&quot; honestly , I don &apos;t know why this man was so rewarded . &quot;
&quot; Franc@@ ey Ze@@ Ãº@@ t prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique , Sam@@ ora Mach@@ el , to remind that a th@@ ief is in prison : &quot;
&quot; thi@@ eves belong to the prison of Sam@@ ora and will not only be remembered as the first independent president , but also as sharp , single @-@ ed@@ ged and - by the way - proph@@ etic speaker . &quot;
&quot; one of his most famous oral representations , when he vigor@@ ously confirmed that &quot; an ambitious person was capable of everything , also father@@ land for his ambi@@ tions , his own individual interest , to sell . &quot;
&quot; Sam@@ ora also said , &quot; I don &apos;t know if an ambitious man changes , my experience shows that it &apos;s not that way . he changes the tactics , but he doesn &apos;t turn away from his ambi@@ tions . &quot;
an ambitious person is at the same time criminal . &quot;
&quot; in Twitter , the reactions were also rejected : &quot;
&quot; Cam@@ ba@@ za was sentenced to 22 years in prison , he was 10 years old and released . &quot;

Facebook blocks the rac@@ ist word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; in Myanmar and cens@@ ored many users
the Bur@@ m@@ ese word &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; means chi@@ ck@@ pe@@ as or spar@@ se .
&quot; photo by San@@ j@@ ay A@@ char@@ ya , Wikipedia Com@@ mons , Creative Com@@ mons Attri@@ bution @-@ Share A@@ like 3.0 Un@@ ported &quot;
&quot; according to Facebook users in Myanmar , the known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; although the origin of the word is still discussed , it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an ad@@ j@@ ective &quot; &quot; Indian &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Facebook cens@@ ored the word &quot; &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; mira@@ ge &quot; &quot; ( in Bur@@ m@@ ese script ) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , the rise of radical nation@@ alist movements has given the word an extremely dero@@ g@@ atory con@@ notation . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it is a word that is mostly used by ultra @-@ nation@@ alists as hate speech against Muslims , representing a minority of the population in Myanmar . &quot;
&quot; but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar , the company has cens@@ ored a lot of meaningful content on its platform . &quot;
&quot; today , Kal@@ ar may normally be associated with racism , but the word in itself does not automatically call hate speech . &quot;
&quot; the context is important &amp; # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; many people have reported that even posts , in which they have discussed the use of the word , have been cens@@ ored for their use . &quot;
&quot; moreover , there are several Bur@@ m@@ ese words with basic mean@@ ings that have the same letter sequence as &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; . &quot;
&quot; for example , chair is written on Bur@@ m@@ ese also &apos; Kal@@ ar h@@ ta@@ ing &apos; , which contains the same letters as well as other words like &apos; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &apos; , &apos; Kal@@ ar O@@ AT &apos; ( cam@@ el ) or &apos; kal@@ ark@@ aar &apos; ( curtain ) . &quot;
the Fac@@ eb@@ oo@@ cr@@ ite A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at explained the different mean@@ ings of words with the sound of &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; so :
a mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kal@@ ar .
&quot; however , he had asked his friends in a wit@@ ty way whether they knew how to allevi@@ ate his back pain by making a pu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; the phrase ku la - &quot; healing &quot; ( ku ) + the question@@ word ( la ) in Bur@@ m@@ ese - resembles the rac@@ ist expression , but the context is completely different . &quot;
there were different reactions to Facebook &apos;s initiative .
&quot; Z@@ in Win H@@ tet is the opinion that it will l@@ essen the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists , but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before all po@@ isons that are suspected of spreading racism . &quot;
Facebook does not delete the word &quot; Kal@@ ar &quot; manually .
it filters the word automatically .
automation will not understand what you are writing on fac@@ e@@ ook .
what it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words .
&quot; for example , &quot; Kal@@ ar H@@ t@@ ine &quot; ( chair ) and &quot; Kal@@ ar pa@@ e &quot; ( spl@@ itting ) . &quot;
&quot; the good thing is that these dirty nation@@ alists , who spread hate speech , get a pretty good lesson . &quot;
now it is time to circumc@@ ise their nation@@ alism .
&quot; while the action may send a strong signal to all that propag@@ ate hate speech , the efficiency of this strategy may not pers@@ ist long . &quot;
&quot; the experiences of social networks in China like S@@ ina Wei@@ bo and We@@ Chat have shown that the cens@@ orship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game , whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative sp@@ elling of the cens@@ ored word to express their views . &quot;
&quot; the author A@@ ung Ka@@ ung My@@ at described how Facebook started to delete his posts , when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; was ban@@ ished from the social network : &quot;
&quot; when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook , I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked . &quot;
&quot; iron@@ ically , my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting , posting and sharing content for 24 hours , because the mail &quot; didn &apos;t meet the Facebook Community standards . &quot; &quot;
Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nation@@ alists .
&quot; Patrick Mur@@ phy wrote that his post was removed , which has nothing to do with hate speech : &quot;
post without hate speech from Facebook .
&quot; in the post , the author shared his opinion on why extreme nation@@ alism and religious fundament@@ alism in the country are bad . &quot;
&quot; Ch@@ an My@@ ae Kh@@ ine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative , for example the Bur@@ m@@ ese Internet community asking for advice : &quot;
&quot; Facebook likes a ben@@ evol@@ ent intent to l@@ essen racism in Burma through its platform , but it does not work . &quot;
cens@@ oring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities .
&quot; in addition , it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words like &quot; &quot; chair &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; pe@@ a cur@@ ry &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; even when they found out that they made mistakes , they did not try to correct the wrong@@ ly deleted posts . &quot;
&quot; if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits , which would give them a large turnover , that would be great . &quot;
Facebook automatic cens@@ orship has caused a lot of ridi@@ cu@@ le among users .
&quot; instead of taking it seriously , users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net . &quot;
&quot; here you can see some screen@@ shots of Facebook posts , which contained no hate speech but were still removed : &quot;
with permission used .
the Bur@@ m@@ ese text reads : &quot; I want to sit on a chair and eat pe@@ as cur@@ ry and watch an Indian movie .
&quot; just to try out if Facebook removes the mail , which contains the word Kal@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; the post says &quot; &quot; If you are a doctor , do you heal people ? &quot;
&quot; screen@@ shot , used with permission . &quot;
&quot; in the last five years , extreme nation@@ alist ide@@ ologies and religious fundament@@ alists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased . &quot;
&quot; among other things , hate speech in social networks is meant to inc@@ ite violence in the communities of Myanmar , especially in the area of Rak@@ h@@ ine , where conflicts between Muslims and Budd@@ hi@@ sts have forced thousands to flee . &quot;
&quot; Facebook was critici@@ zed for its failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on its Bur@@ m@@ ese sites , critic@@ ising it . &quot;
&quot; but instead of cens@@ oring the word &apos; Kal@@ ar &apos; , it would have been better to look at the context rather than code @-@ focused initiatives and learned from them . &quot;
in Trinidad and # 0@@ 38 ; Tob@@ ago is an end to bab@@ e

the e @-@ toe is now illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
&quot; on 9 June 2017 , the Parliament of the country has unanim@@ ously decided on a law bann@@ ing this practice so that the age @-@ appropriate age is now 18 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , brother Har@@ ry@@ per@@ sad Mahar@@ aj , the leader of the Inter@@ religious Organization ( I@@ RO ) , a group that representatives of the various religious groups of the country ga@@ thers that the state should not interfere , since that , age does not determine the maturity . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is a contractual partner of the United Nations Children &apos;s Rights Convention , the min@@ ors are defined as &quot; every person under the age of 18 . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the UN stat@@ s for the years 2002 @-@ 2012 show that the share of children , which were married to 15 , was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and at 18 it was 8.1 percent . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , the country &apos;s statistical central office confirmed that more than 8@@ 400 girls and 1,@@ 300 boys were married under 19 in 1997 @-@ 2007 . &quot;
&quot; online peti@@ tions and social media movements , which were striving to abol@@ ish laws for child marriage , followed at the foot and enjoyed great support . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , not everything went smoothly . &quot;
&quot; a Hind@@ u leader , for example , had no qual@@ ms about telling the critics of the children wo@@ e , they were supposed to take care of their own affairs . &quot;
&quot; this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this un@@ complicated matter , and at some point , doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all . &quot;
&quot; but at the beginning of 2017 , the bill was decided against the child before - despite 4 sen@@ ators ( including a woman ) of the opposition and an independent who held it - so that he could be deb@@ ated in the House of Represent@@ atives , where a simple majority would make him the law . &quot;
now only the President of the country has to agree and declare the law .
one of the country &apos;s Sen@@ ators announced on Facebook a status update which Les@@ lie @-@ Ann Bo@@ is@@ elle posted on Inst@@ agra@@ m :
Mr. Senator Clar@@ ence Ram@@ b@@ har@@ at : the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Represent@@ atives with 35 votes and no one decided against it .
&quot; after it has previously been approved by the Senate , the draft can now become a law . &quot;
&quot; the majority of social media users were thrilled , because the laws were finally changed for children . &quot;
&quot; Facebook member Lo@@ vel@@ l Francis , who suffers from a minist@@ erial ministry in the Ministry of Education , said : &quot;
&quot; it took too much time and unnecessary talk which has concealed the heart of the matter , but do you know what ? the e @-@ toe is illegal in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago , and it is worth almost any price . &quot;
&quot; while Abel Jackson was in the opinion , it was definitely long enough to abol@@ ish the practice , L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all @-@ Thomas was over@@ jo@@ yed that the day had finally come : &quot;
&quot; public Status update on Facebook by L@@ ara Qu@@ entr@@ all@@ - Thomas , which says : , &quot; &quot; Excell@@ ent news ! &quot;
the marriage network has been decided .
&quot; minimum age - 18 , Vo@@ ices - 35 for it - 0 against it ! ! ! ! &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ade Mut@@ ota , which belongs to the Women &apos;s Institute for Alternative Development ( WI@@ NA@@ D ) , a civil society group who openly spoke about how important the adoption of the law was , noted : &quot;
the marriage @-@ capable age in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago is now independent of the religious affili@@ ation 18 years .
&quot; the draft for the amendment of the Act was adopted today , on 9 June 2017 . &quot;
there are 41 members in the House of Represent@@ atives and 35 of them were present at the vote .
&quot; all de@@ pu@@ ties , who were present , voted for the law . &quot;
the e @-@ toe is legally no longer allowed in Trinidad and Tob@@ ago .
it was a long fight ( ... ) # child@@ like shelter .
many thanks to all activists who fought him .
congratulations .
a thank you to our de@@ pu@@ ties .
&quot; a possible catch comes in the shape of Sat Mahar@@ aj therefore , the Secretary General of the San@@ atan Dhar@@ ma Mah@@ a Sab@@ ha , the most known Hind@@ u organization of the country . &quot;
&quot; months ago , Mahar@@ aj announced his intention to take legal action , the law should be passed , and he seems to be able to fulfil his promise . &quot;
&quot; while the At@@ tor@@ ney General Paris Al ra@@ wi , an advocate of the law , said it was absolutely right if Mahar@@ aj wished to act against the law , most social media users wished that the debate would go differently . &quot;
Patricia Wor@@ rel@@ l proposed :
&quot; dear Sat , if we , rather than discussing the debate so general , in a way that can only provoke panic and arrogan@@ ce , we would simply say that the state , our daughters , protects them from being ab@@ used by large , hard @-@ boiled men that are beneficial to them , &quot; would you then be ready to continue the discussion ? &quot;
or do you think that this is not a problem ?
&quot; but whether it comes to a judicial procedure against the law or not , this legislation is an important step - however , there are still places in the world in which the children are legal or still the norm in different gra@@ dations , even though there are laws they prohi@@ bit . &quot;

created by Wikipedia ( CC B@@ Y @-@ SA 3.0 )
&quot; for more than a month now , Turkey has been blocking the popular and crow@@ d@@ sourcing principle of en@@ cyclo@@ pedia Wikipedia . &quot;
day by day it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information .
both students and re@@ porters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the block@@ ade .
&quot; although many tech @-@ vers@@ ed Internet users are used to use circum@@ scri@@ bing tools for blocked websites ( a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN pre@@ valence ) , most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category . &quot;
&quot; although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008 , as described recently in a published report by Ber@@ k@@ man Klein Center for Internet &amp; amp ; Society at Harvard University , regular block@@ ages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act ( No. 56@@ 51 ) was adopted . &quot;
&quot; according to China , Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive cens@@ orship of Wikipedia . &quot;
&quot; while the platform remains closed , there are now several folders ( pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated ) . &quot;
&quot; a solution came from IP@@ FS ( the Inter@@ Plan@@ etary File System ) , when the platform depen@@ ded on all Turkish wi@@ ki@@ pedia sites on its decentr@@ alized Peer @-@ to @-@ Peer network , which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete cens@@ orship difficult . &quot;

a Nep@@ al@@ ese wildlife photographer uses his camera to draw attention to the need for nature conservation

Sag@@ ar Gir@@ i was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him . they were blur@@ red with poorly positioned motives and balanced colours .
the motivated him to carry a camera and try to strai@@ gh@@ ten the situation .
back then he was still a child .
&quot; today , at the age of 28 , Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to bring N@@ ept@@ une to the international stage . &quot;
&quot; and his hom@@ etown , next to the Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s wildlife . &quot;
he described on Facebook how he helps him in his work :
&quot; I live at the edge of Ch@@ it@@ wan National Park , a world natural heritage . what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer ! ! &quot;
I just rested at home when suddenly Navar@@ re ( the manager of Ch@@ it@@ wan G@@ aida lodge ) called me . he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rap@@ ti river a le@@ op@@ ard would be .
the river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sau@@ ra@@ ha .
immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes .
&quot; my father observed it and showed me the place on the other side of the river , where the le@@ op@@ ard was located and I immediately began to gn@@ ash pictures ! ! &quot;
Sag@@ ar stri@@ ves to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and would like to deep@@ en the understanding that wild animals are not as frigh@@ tening as they look .
&quot; and he should know it , for he stood afar off to tig@@ ers : &quot;
a tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep ! !
late in the evening . the light is too weak .
sleeping time for all animals and birds .
&quot; also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the sword appeared . he immediately sat down , we look at him and he star@@ es me through the S@@ al @-@ trees ! ! &quot;
&quot; to promote the protection of wild animals , Sag@@ ar places the logo &quot; &quot; I click for conservation &quot; &quot; ( lit . : I click for environmental protection ) on its photos . &quot;
but his passion for the promotion of N@@ ept@@ une &apos;s nature and wildlife is not always easy .
he waited 22 days long and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of Ot@@ ters at the Bar@@ dia National Park . up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations .
check out some of these photos below .

&quot; this entry was written by Kay@@ on@@ a@@ az K@@ aly@@ prosec@@ a and was originally published on video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , an award @-@ winning international media organisation from India . &quot;
a revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement .
&quot; in many parts of India , it is important to avoid women with the greatest care to pron@@ ounce the names of their hus@@ bands or even older men in the family . &quot;
&quot; instead , they use a pron@@ ou@@ n or say &quot; &quot; father of my child . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; from Ch@@ hat@@ tis@@ gar@@ h to Mahar@@ ash@@ tra and U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h , women admit that due to social pressure they respect the husband , as well as fear of consequences , they should dis@@ regard the norm , get this practice alive . &quot;
last year Mal@@ ati Mah@@ at@@ oto was convic@@ ted of the Indian state of O@@ dish@@ a and was expelled by her family and community after she had met a married relative with her name .
&quot; the tradition of their wives also does not mention the name , is also common among men . however , they have far less rebu@@ kes to fear , if at all , they should not follow this practice . &quot;
&quot; in the small village of Wal@@ he in the P@@ une district , in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra , nine women , including health workers and house@@ wives , entered a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city . &quot;
it is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intri@@ c@@ acies of the patri@@ archy .
&quot; as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states , it is part of the # K@@ hel@@ Bad@@ al campaign run by the community of video Vol@@ un@@ te@@ ers and campaig@@ ning for the disman@@ tling of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini Pa@@ ine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as children &apos;s marriage to the exile of HI@@ V@@ - and AIDS @-@ infected , and leads this club . &quot;
she reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambass@@ adors of change .
the first video that Roh@@ ini showed in their discussion was women who did not call their hus@@ bands by name .
she chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patri@@ arch@@ ate with a problem with which the women could easily identify themselves .
&quot; not to pron@@ ounce the name of their hus@@ bands out loud , is a custom which they all have to maintain and never questioned . &quot;
Roh@@ ini means :
this tradition testi@@ fies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life .
a woman who does not consider this is considered dec@@ eit@@ ful as a woman without morality .
tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion .
&quot; at the beginning , Roh@@ ini , who had never called her husband by name , wanted to try out at home , as it is going on . &quot;
she showed the video of the discussion on her husband and her mother @-@ in @-@ law .
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
my mother @-@ in @-@ law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over .
&quot; practice , my husband , turned to me and said that I should call him by now on his name . &quot;
with this self @-@ confidence in luggage Roh@@ ini launched its first discussion club .
&quot; many women had never heard the word &quot; patriarch@@ ate &quot; before . some believed that it was a good thing , because it meant that the younger members of a family , especially girls and women , would be protected . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the round , Roh@@ ini showed a video about the problem in U@@ t@@ tar Pra@@ des@@ h . &quot;
&quot; after the video projection , the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise . &quot;
&quot; Roh@@ ini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy , angry , sad , loving and so on . &quot;
&quot; then she asked all , &quot; &quot; If we cannot tell the name of our hus@@ bands , but they can call us how they want , does this mean that they do not respect us ? &quot;
should it not be equivalent ? &quot;
&quot; some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they gave the name of their hus@@ bands on their lips , &quot; says Roh@@ ini Pa@@ z of the village Wal@@ he in Mahar@@ ash@@ tra about the breaking of a centuries @-@ old tradition where married women never have the name of their hus@@ bands . &quot;
Roh@@ ini re@@ counts :
a woman was so shy that she was only gi@@ g@@ gling before her during the whole exercise ; another decided to leave the entire fru@@ stration against him and his family by cur@@ sing him .
the expression on their faces was ec@@ static .
I think I will never forget it again .
&quot; still in the rush of adren@@ aline , having broken with an ancient custom , the women decided they would actually try to call their hus@@ bands by name . &quot;
and they kept their word .
&quot; in the coming days , Roh@@ ini received a large number of reports . &quot;
the husband of a woman called Roh@@ ini and asked what ideas she put in her head : his wife couldn &apos;t stop saying his name .
another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family .
&quot; when her mother @-@ in @-@ law star@@ ed her , she was afraid and said that it was a mistake . &quot;
&quot; another woman said , &quot; &quot; Roh@@ ini thought I should do it . &quot;
a husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arose in force .
&quot; Roh@@ ini reports how women have tried to stop other practices , such as wearing the t@@ ine @-@ red dot on the forehead , which indicates the mar@@ ital status : &quot;
why do women only need to show that they are married ?
&quot; I said to my husband , that I would wear the petrol @-@ red dot if he did it too . &quot;
he laugh@@ ed only and I stopped wearing it .
&quot; the other women have not completely stopped working , but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days . &quot;
&quot; for many women , the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we take a trip at each disc@@ us club . &quot;
normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field .
&quot; I don &apos;t want women to take care of who could hear what they hear , &quot; she says . &quot;
in the last months they celebrated their own birth@@ days with cakes for the first time in their life ; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before .
Roh@@ ini says :
&quot; I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things , for example like our identi@@ ties to our hus@@ bands . &quot;
&quot; it feels great to be able to say certain things , no matter how small they occur . &quot;
&quot; in a panel discussion , we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothes . &quot;
some women in the group have only been wearing sar@@ is since their marriage .
&quot; for most it &apos;s okay , but some wanted a sage bud@@ dy , wearing a wide shirt over a pair of pants , they didn &apos;t dare . &quot;
&quot; after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes , morality combined with the Sar@@ is and much more , Roh@@ ini smu@@ g@@ gled their own couple of Kur@@ tas ( upper shirts ) into a discussion board so that the women could wear them . &quot;
&quot; next , they decided to take a trip to Go@@ a where they can wear jeans and Roh@@ ini is sure they will succeed . &quot;
Roh@@ ini confirms that things are slowly rolling in the five months since their first discussion club .
so far we have only done small steps .
&quot; some women tried it a few times , but then stopped telling the name of her husband . &quot;
&quot; some , including me , do it yet , but only if they are alone and no other family members are there . &quot;
only one or two women continue to say the names of their hus@@ bands ; only one or two women now wear Zin@@ no@@ ber@@ rot on their forehead .
women in the discussion club know that the changes they wish to achieve in their lives - like the hag@@ gling for more freedom of movement or the own coat of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river .
&quot; by giving each other self @-@ confidence , they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat . &quot;
how Roh@@ ini explains :
each of us is a victim of the Patri@@ arch@@ ate .
I am also .
but this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change .
and I know that it is not limited to 30 families . there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing .
we are all in the same boat .

the visit of the Beat@@ les in Japan in 1966 is regarded as a turning point in the Japanese culture of the post @-@ war era .
&quot; the first Japanese journalist , Hos@@ hi@@ ka Rum@@ i@@ ko , who inter@@ viewed the Beat@@ les 1964 in London , re@@ marked the 50@@ th anniversary of the first visit : &quot;
&quot; for just about five days , the Beat@@ les were in the country , but this was enough to let the Japanese go through . &quot;
it became clear to the people here that they had no choice but to receive the Beat@@ les with open arms .
many known Japanese sizes had reached their zen@@ ith when the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time in 1966 .
&quot; the music of the cult band is &quot; more than just a universal language as English , &quot; Ry@@ u@@ ich@@ i Is@@ aka , president of the retail giant Seven &amp; amp ; i Hol@@ dings , the online magazine Nik@@ k@@ ei Asian Review . &quot;
&quot; good morning ! today is the day of the Beat@@ les Memorial Day in Japan . the first 51 years ago , they were here in Tokyo . &quot;

I don &apos;t know if this &quot; Win@@ nie the P@@ oo@@ h &quot; doll is supposed to represent John L@@ enn@@ on or not .
&quot; and as it is for fans , Japanese naturally also make pilgri@@ ma@@ ges to the famous places associated with the band . &quot;
&quot; when you love the Beat@@ les , these are your 5 places that you absolutely must visit . &quot;

&quot; just today in 1966 , the Beat@@ les came to Japan for the first time . &quot;
the characters from the movie K @-@ On ! went on a pilgrimage to London and ran across Abbey Road .
we did the same last year .
&quot; and of course , some companies also use the fan community for marketing purposes , such as this R@@ amen Shop ( R@@ amen are Japanese no@@ od@@ les ) in Tokyo . &quot;
&quot; good morning , here is Mut@@ a@@ hi@@ ro Ko@@ ya R@@ amen ! today is Beat@@ les Memorial Day . &quot;

sli@@ t @-@ headed men are deported and killed in Mozambique
the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia warned the population that sli@@ pper@@ y men could be targets of attack in Mozambique .
&quot; photo : different Bol@@ in / Fli@@ ck@@ r , CC @-@ B@@ Y @-@ NC 2.0 &quot;
&quot; a new system of kidn@@ apping of smu@@ g@@ gled individuals for organ trafficking , probably for dis@@ believing purposes , worries the police of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , a province in Mozambique . the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the month , three men were killed in the district of Mil@@ ange , a few kilometres from the border to Malawi . &quot;
one of the victims was be@@ headed and some of the organs were taken .
two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of sham@@ ans in Tanzania and Malawi were used .
&quot; there is the local super@@ sti@@ tion that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth , the police spokes@@ man of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia of the BBC declared . &quot;
it is the first time that successive attacks on smu@@ g@@ gled men were registered in Mozambique .
&quot; another group , the goal of assass@@ inations for obsc@@ ure purposes , is people with al@@ bin@@ ism . &quot;
this led to the fact that the UN 2016 in the South African country conducted a mission to investigate this practice .
&quot; persecution of people with al@@ bin@@ ism is common in other countries of southern Africa , especially in neighbouring Tanzania , where the government developed campaigns to combat this super@@ sti@@ tion and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
U@@ kom@@ be We@@ ya lives in the town of Map@@ u@@ to .
he warned those willing to travel to the country :
&quot; attention to k@@ ah@@ le men who travel to Mozambique are target ritual attacks , warned the Mozambique police according to the latest assass@@ inations of three young men on account of their body parts . &quot;
&quot; two susp@@ ects were arrested in the district of Mil@@ ange , where the kill@@ ings took place . &quot;
&quot; Hus@@ ked Al@@ gy Adam@@ o , student and inhabit@@ ant of the city of In@@ ham@@ ban@@ e in the south of Mozambique , said that the local police are already following the case : &quot;
PR@@ M believes that the sham@@ ans are involved in the death of the sli@@ pper@@ y men .
&quot; the persecution and murder of smu@@ g@@ gled individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a , Province of Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zia , has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional sham@@ ans ( PR@@ M ) , which also indicates that a belief existed , according to which the victims in the head had power , generating wealth . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country . &quot;
&quot; Angela Fer@@ rei@@ ra Sam@@ an@@ tha shared the Chron@@ icle of the B@@ log@@ gers poor Sn@@ ai@@ ppa on Facebook , indicating that the problem is part of the greater social difficulty that Mozambique faces : &quot;
&quot; I WI@@ LL LOVE E@@ IN Mos@@ ambique , THE S@@ ICH ashamed One country in which people would feel shame to demand sex against good marks , and others would not harm others or even take their lives to earn their bread , a country in which neither the alt@@ bin@@ os nor k@@ ah@@ le or gl@@ are @-@ headed for dis@@ believing purposes or &quot; black magic &quot; will be hun@@ ted , aimed at reaching fast wealth . &quot;
&quot; despite the seri@@ ousness of the phenomenon , some could not miss the opportunity for mac@@ ab@@ re humour . &quot;
&quot; Zen@@ aida Mach@@ ado , scientist of Human Rights Watch for Angola and Mozambique and thrilled Twitter user , twe@@ et@@ ete that both the chief of the Mor@@ rum@@ bal@@ a District , Pedro S@@ apphire , and the police spokes@@ man Zam@@ b@@ Ã©@@ zi@@ as , In@@ Ã¡@@ cio D@@ ina , are both bald : &quot;

we are deeply affected by the death of our friend Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il .
&quot; we mo@@ urn for him and express our heart@@ felt sympathy to his family , his friends , and all those who knew him and loved him . &quot;
&quot; a pioneer of the Creative Com@@ mons in Syria , active in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia , Bass@@ el K@@ hart@@ ab@@ il ( also known as Bass@@ el Saf@@ adi ) took a key role in expanding public access to the internet and open knowledge . &quot;
he was a close friend of many of the Global Vo@@ ices Community and participated in our meetings of the Arab blo@@ gger in 2009 .
&quot; in November 2015 , Bas@@ le &apos;s wife N@@ our@@ a G@@ haz@@ i reported that she had been contacted by persons who out@@ lived themselves as an insi@@ der of the Assad government . &quot;
&quot; they reported that their husband was sentenced to death , but gave no further information . &quot;
&quot; Bas@@ le &apos;s stay and constitution were unknown until today ( August 01 , 2017 ) , when N@@ our@@ a of Syrian officials learned that he was executed in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; today and in the future , we will be honored by Bass@@ el &apos;s work as a pioneer of the open web movement . &quot;
we appreciate the efforts of all the individuals and organizations that have been campaig@@ ning for their release over the past five years .
&quot; since 2011 and the beginning of protests against the regime of Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , more than 65@@ ,000 people have disappeared , the organisation of Syrian Network for Human Rights . &quot;
&quot; countless of those arrested by the regime , or forci@@ bly disappeared , are subjected to torture and even exec@@ utions . &quot;
&quot; between 2011 and 2016 , no less than 17,@@ 7@@ 23 Syrians have died in prison , the international human rights organisation Am@@ nesty International . &quot;

&quot; free Bass@@ el : ne@@ tizen Under Seri@@ ous Th@@ re@@ at , December 2012 ( in English ) New reactions of the international community for medical treatment of Nobel lau@@ re@@ ates and Dis@@ sident Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o &quot;
&quot; a photo of Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o and Li@@ u X@@ ia , which was probably made recently . &quot;
&quot; this story was originally published on July 8 , 2017 at Hong Kong Free Press . &quot;
the following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Vo@@ ices .
the case of the imprisoned Chinese dissi@@ dents Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospit@@ alized for liver cancer in the final stage .
&quot; in 2009 , Li@@ u was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for &quot; Subversion &quot; ( State endanger@@ ment ) after having participated in the draft Charter 08 , a manifest@@ o calling for democratic reforms in China . &quot;
he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010 .
the State Department in China referred to Li@@ us as an &quot; an internal affair &quot; and told a spokes@@ man that he considered it &quot; not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , China continues to receive calls from the international community , Nobel lau@@ re@@ ate and his wife , poet Li@@ u X@@ ia , or to allow him treatment abroad . &quot;
&quot; while some countries have critici@@ zed the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing , others are completely wi@@ ped out on the subject . &quot;
Hong Kong Free Press has summ@@ arized some reactions from abroad .
united nations
&quot; Zei@@ d R@@ a @-@ ad al @-@ Hussein , United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights , met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Li@@ u . &quot;
&quot; however , a spokes@@ man refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Li@@ u abroad to be treated . &quot;
Norway and Norway
Norway &apos;s Prime Minister Er@@ na Sol@@ berg and Foreign Minister B@@ Ã¸r@@ ge Br@@ ende refused to answer questions about Li@@ us release .
&quot; the relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Li@@ u in 2010 , although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision . &quot;
diplomatic relations continued until December last year . only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China because exports have been largely blocked since 2010 .
&quot; after the news spread that Li@@ u was seriously ill , the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Li@@ u to pick up his prize in Oslo . &quot;
&quot; due to his imprisonment , he was unable to accept his prize . &quot;
during the ceremony Li@@ u was represented by an empty chair .
European Union and the European Union
&quot; on 6 July , the European Parliament adopted a resolution calling upon China to free Li@@ u and his wife from house arrest and allow him to seek medical assistance wherever he wants . &quot;
&quot; the top diplom@@ at of the EU , Feder@@ ica Mo@@ gher@@ ini , also called for the release of Li@@ us as she announced in a statement on 30 June : &quot;
&quot; at the same time , we expect China to lift all the limitations of Mr. Li@@ us &apos;s wife and family members . &quot;
&quot; they should meet and receive all visits they desire , and be able to communicate freely with the outside world . &quot;
United States of America
&quot; ambassador Ter@@ ry Bran@@ stad told that the Americans would &quot; &quot; wish him that he has the opportunity for treatment abroad , in so far as he can help him with his recovery . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of the US embassy in China , Mary Beth Pol@@ ley , announced that the message agency AF@@ P announced on June 27 that the embassy asks the Chinese authorities not only to release Li@@ u , but also to free his wife Li@@ u X@@ ia from house arrest . &quot;
&quot; the request of the US embassy drew an angry response from China , with the statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that &quot; &quot; no country has the right to interfere and to make ir@@ responsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs . &quot;
Pol@@ ley announced that China should offer the couple the following :
&quot; protection and freedom , such as freedom of travel and access to the medical care of its choice , to which they claim according to Chinese constitution and legal system as well as international obligations . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. Sen@@ ators Marco Ru@@ bio , Jeff Merk@@ ley and T@@ ed Cruz have also adopted a vote in Congress to urge the Chinese government to release Li@@ u and his wife un@@ condition@@ ally . &quot;

&quot; the German government spokes@@ man Steffen Sei@@ bert wrote on 3 July , Berlin hopes that Li@@ u will receive all the medical support he needs , and that a &quot; humanitarian solution for Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o should be the highest priority . &quot; &quot;
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping appeared on the G@@ 20 summit in Hamburg on 7 and 8 July .
&quot; previously reported diplomatic sources in Beijing &apos;s news agency Reu@@ ters reported that China had big concerns , whether the vor@@ tex around Li@@ u could over@@ shadow the visit to Hamburg . &quot;
Canada and Canada
&quot; on 28 June , the Canadian ambassador John Mc@@ Call@@ um called for China to provide Li@@ u an appropriate medical care and give him the opportunity to be taken care of by his family . &quot;
&quot; Li@@ us lawyer told AF@@ P previously that Li@@ u X@@ ia , Li@@ u X@@ ia , could visit him every day , but the police always watched the room in the hospital and that Li@@ u is not allowed to talk to someone outside , including his attor@@ neys . &quot;
Mc@@ Call@@ um continues to tell :
&quot; Canada calls for China to uph@@ old its international human rights obligations , including freedom of expression , and freedom of expression for the exercise of these rights . &quot;
France and France
&quot; in a declaration on 29 June , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requested China to release Li@@ u for humanitarian reasons : &quot;
&quot; all necessary measures must be taken to ensure that Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o receives all treatments that he , regardless of where , needs . furthermore , his wife and family should have contact with him . &quot;
&quot; although the news channel France Info already reported that the French government would welcome Li@@ u in the country , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced that there is no further information whether France will ultimately pick it up . &quot;
Taiwan and Taiwan
&quot; &quot; &quot; the Council of continental affairs in Taiwan called on China on 27 June to release Li@@ u and to show a greater tolerance towards those who use peaceful means to demand political reforms and democratic development . &quot;
Tai@@ wan@@ ese legisl@@ ator Yu Me@@ i @-@ nu from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party also called for China to allow the sick of intellectual Li@@ u to be treated in Taiwan .
Dalai Lama and the Dalai Lama
&quot; the spiritual leader in Tibet , the Dalai Lama , was very concerned about Li@@ u in an explanation on 28 June and claimed that many asked him to pray for Li@@ us well being . &quot;
he spoke about Li@@ u :
&quot; it is my belief that the initiatives he took and for which he had been severely punished , would have led to a more harmonious , more stable and prosper@@ ous China , which in turn would have contributed to a more peaceful world . &quot;
&quot; I personally felt very moved and encouraged when I saw that hundreds of Chinese intellectuals and affected citizens , inspired by Li@@ u Xi@@ a@@ ob@@ o , signed the Charter 08 , which stands for democracy , freedom and rule of law in China . &quot;
Singapore : city or country ?

is Singapore a city or country ?
the question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state internationally .
&quot; but according to the Minister of Justice K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , Singapore should be regarded as a city . &quot;
this remark triggered a debate in the blo@@ gos@@ ph@@ ere .
during the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association the Minister noted that many people critici@@ zed the domin@@ ance of Singapore &apos;s only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries .
he supported Singapore to be regarded as a city .
... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy ...
this is where most people commit a mistake .
I have tried to explain that we are different .
we are a city .
we are not a country .
&quot; the blog Cav@@ ali@@ eri@@ o accused the Minister of Justice to &quot; &quot; twist the logic &quot; &quot; to defend the existing authorit@@ arian exercise of power in Singapore . &quot;
&quot; and then , after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land , one hears that we are ultimately not a country . &quot;
&quot; it sounded so vul@@ gar , it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities , a breach of duty . &quot;
&quot; Singapore , if you are not my country , whose country is it then ? &quot;
&quot; the reasons cited by Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam were not very noble : he defended an idea , according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other &apos; normal countries &apos; , in the face of that , he seemed in@@ vari@@ ably un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago , San Francisco or New York , equally cities which are permanently ro@@ uted by a party . &quot;
these cities are democratic .
&quot; once you reach the heart of the subject , the good old corp@@ se appears again by the authorit@@ arian rulers who pre@@ tend to be demo@@ crats , leaving the twisted logic because it fits better to their power . &quot;
&quot; in the end , the last week of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press , our judi@@ ci@@ ary , our political system , really non @-@ rep@@ lies . &quot;
he asked questions in a rational way with non @-@ answers .
&quot; Rachel Z@@ eng ur@@ ges Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam to clarify his opinion , because she did not understand this conclusion . &quot;
I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow .
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , but a city , so to which country belongs our city ... &quot;
&quot; in short , I don &apos;t understand anything . &quot;
I would be very grateful if our dear K Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam would take the trouble to clarify this point as long as he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore .
&quot; by publishing his comment on the blog , he points to the critics that you should start reading the entire manuscript of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &apos;s statements , according to which Singapore is a city and not a country . &quot;
read the tran@@ script .
&quot; when he said Singapore was rather a &quot; city &quot; than a country , &quot; he explained why the Singapore elections were so un@@ equal , even if we enjoy free and just elections . &quot;
he compared Singapore with cities in the USA ( and how many of these cities saw a party for decades ? ) .
&quot; when he said that Singapore is not a country , he obviously did not mean it in this sense ! &quot;
&quot; C@@ lement T@@ an shows his disappointment about Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , who is a leader of a growing generation , making such a pol@@ em@@ ical statement . &quot;
&quot; I am very embarrass@@ ed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said , very embarrass@@ ed ... &quot;
&quot; at least I knew with Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew and the members of the old guard , what I expected - whether I agree with them or not , but that &apos;s another thing . &quot;
&quot; but with K. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam , a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore , I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is right and aware of what he def@@ ends . &quot;
the TE@@ MA@@ SE@@ K review dis@@ covers the weaknesses of Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ g@@ ams &apos;s arguments :
&quot; did Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam &quot; &quot; bad faith &quot; &quot; committed a mistake or was it a Freu@@ dian spokes@@ man ? &quot;
&quot; if Singapore is not a country , we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state ? &quot;
&quot; if not , what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore go back ? &quot;
Singapore is unique ; it is equally land and city .
&quot; as he plays an important role within the government cabinet , the statements of Mr. Sh@@ an@@ mu@@ gam are of serious significance . &quot;
&quot; why do the people of Singapore do their military service , do they only defend their city but not their country ? &quot;
who must pay back our Prime Minister Bill ?
what is the value of our staff ?
are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city ?
&quot; through Journey of a Dec@@ ade to Be@@ j@@ ah@@ ung , Singapore , the magazine Journey of a Dec@@ ade has always been a city : &quot;
I did not say what I said ...
this sentence seems to have anno@@ yed many people of Singapore ...
nobody ever said Singapore is a country .
we were always a city .
we have always been a city / island state .
&quot; I can understand that we often hear statements like &quot; the defense of the country , especially &quot; etc . , but that is not quite right . &quot;
we should rather speak of the defence of the city .
the My@@ th of the &quot; nice Canadian &quot;
the Canadian N@@ ed Flan@@ ders .
screen@@ shot from a YouTube video .
&quot; recently , Global Vo@@ ices asked its editors : what is the most mis@@ understood aspect of your home or homeland ? &quot;
their answers are published here as part of an ongoing series with which rum@@ ors about certain parts of the world are exposed and another fac@@ et is to be shown .
&quot; the latest part of this series comes from Nev@@ in Thom@@ p@@ son , Editor for Global Vo@@ ices , Japan , who lives in Canada and Japan . &quot;
the question I am most asked in Japan is : &quot; are you Americans ? &quot;
&quot; no , I &apos;m sorry , &quot; I &apos;ll answer . &quot; I &apos;m from Canada . &quot; since 1994 I have lived there and again in Japan . &quot;
&quot; depending on the situation the conversation takes place , it is considered pol@@ itely to show interest in his inter@@ loc@@ utor by asking personal questions . &quot;
&quot; my clari@@ fication then follows mostly the standard answer : &quot; Oh , Rocky Mountains , Ice Ho@@ ckey , Nature . &quot; many Canadi@@ ans cook perhaps in@@ war@@ dly in anger if they are held for Americans , but that doesn &apos;t bother me . &quot;
&quot; for someone who doesn &apos;t know himself , there is little that distinguishes us Canadi@@ ans from Americans . &quot;
this is one of the reasons why so many Canadi@@ ans get a Canadian flag well visible in their back@@ pack when they travel .
all love Canadi@@ ans .
Americans on the other hand ... .
&quot; so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Tru@@ mp , before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11 . &quot;
Canadi@@ ans have always carried small map@@ le sheets on their luggage to distinguish themselves from their American neighbours .
we have a free health care system !
there are no weapons with us !
same @-@ sex marri@@ ages have been legal in Canada since 2005 !
everyone seems to think Canada is so great .
we are pol@@ ite .
we obviously say very often &quot; ap@@ ologies . &quot;
Canada is said to be the most tolerant country towards ethnic groups .
we are not like these guys south of the border .
we Canadi@@ ans are nice .
I hate that .
&quot; first , I have many American friends , whom I admire very much . &quot;
it would not matter if you were mistaken for example with Johnny from Dallas .
with Marc from Austin .
with Adam from San Francisco .
or with Michael from Hon@@ ol@@ ul@@ u .
but there are also some problems with the stamp &quot; nice . &quot;
&quot; first , being called &quot; nice , &quot; is basically to be sp@@ iny - like the good @-@ nat@@ ured , gentle but tra@@ gically in@@ significant figure N@@ ed Flan@@ ders from &quot; The Simp@@ sons &quot; ( who has its own Canadian Doppel@@ gÃ¤n@@ ger ) . &quot;
&quot; if Canada really is a nation full of people like N@@ ed Flan@@ ders , this would indeed be a step forward . but the real problem is that &quot; nice &quot; has no personality . &quot;
&quot; there are no corners and edges , nothing you can encounter . &quot;
being harmless means to be un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive and un@@ interesting and to earn no attention .
&quot; this can be a good thing if you want to stay un@@ noticed in the background , away from the things that happen around you . &quot;
&quot; even so far , I would say that the desire to be free and alone is a main property of the Canadian . &quot;
we tend to take care of our own affairs only .
what out@@ si@@ ders call &quot; nice &quot; is perhaps just cool courtesy .
Canadi@@ ans do not often talk about the fence with their neighbours .
&quot; we lack the warm , open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends . &quot;
&quot; thank@@ fully for us ( and for the rest of the world ) , J@@ ustin Tru@@ deau then entered the stage to show that Canadi@@ ans are more than just &quot; &quot; nice &quot; . &quot; &quot;
music video of a pop band par@@ o@@ dies Tha@@ il@@ ands Jun@@ ta
&quot; a popular pop band in Thailand released a music video that the Jun@@ ta par@@ o@@ dies , which took over the power in 2014 and in spite of its promise to restore the civilian government , continues to rule the country . &quot;
the new song &quot; Dic@@ t@@ ator Girl &quot; ( P@@ ha@@ det Girl ) of the band Tat@@ too Colour describes a young man who tells him what rules his girlfriend makes .
&quot; although not explicitly political , the music video refers indirectly to the ongoing military rule of the jun@@ ta . &quot;
the band was praised by many fans and other Internet users for their courage to describe the situation of the country .
the video of the song was a huge success .
&quot; within the first three days alone , the video uploaded to Facebook was shared 1.@@ 25@@ 4 times and received 8,@@ 800 li@@ kes . &quot;
&quot; last month , the Charlie Chap@@ lin video &quot; The dict@@ ator &quot; in Thailand was blocked after a group of activists asked the public to watch this video . &quot;
&quot; the video can be interpreted as a creative and entertaining introduction to Thai politics , especially about the situation of the country under the jun@@ ta rule . &quot;
&quot; take a look at these videos , which relate to some of the political issues that Thailand has consistently pursued over the past three years . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; 44 rules of the girls &quot; may refer to the dra@@ con@@ ian section 44 of the provisional constitution , which gives absolute power to the commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the army on important national issues . &quot;
&quot; the 11th Ru@@ le : &quot; change your attitude &quot; refers to the not@@ orious programme for the &quot; change of imagination &quot; of journalists , students , scientists , activists , politicians and other persons seen by the Jun@@ ta as critics . &quot;
&quot; the picture above reflects the introduction of the law on computer crime , whose vag@@ ue and unclear rules are often used by the authorities to arrest activists and other critics of the state . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , a new unit was set up in the army that monitors online content and prosec@@ uted those accused of having slan@@ dered the monarchy . &quot;
Thailand sets a strict end against &quot; L@@ ese Maj@@ esty &quot; ( Maj@@ estic Viol@@ ation ) .
&quot; on 20 May 2014 , martial law was proclaimed in Thailand . &quot;
&quot; two days later , it came to a coup by the army . &quot;
&quot; one of the problems the Jun@@ ta continues to pursue is its decision to buy expensive sub@@ mar@@ ines , although security experts warn them that the purchase is unnecessary and a waste of tax payments . &quot;
&quot; the video even shows how people are thrown into a black vans , before bringing them into an intern@@ ment camp , another problem . &quot;
&quot; some journalists are in prison because they allegedly caused &quot; confusion &quot; in society and Internet users are threatened with long prison sentences , they should insul@@ t the monarchy . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile the te@@ aser of the songs showed members of the band , who im@@ itated the Sal@@ ut from &quot; The Tri@@ bute of Pan@@ em , &quot; who was already being used by Putin &apos;s opponents during the 2014 protests . &quot;
life goes on in the ruins of the ghost towns in eastern Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia

&quot; the following article , written by D@@ mit@@ ri Stat@@ ey@@ nov , was first published on the website of OC Media and is published here with friendly permission . &quot;
&quot; the post @-@ war society only reco@@ vers very slowly in East @-@ Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , especially in the district of T@@ ku@@ st@@ al . &quot;
&quot; it has been over 20 years since the Geor@@ gian @-@ Lithu@@ anian war has been officially ended , but its sc@@ ars are still highly visible in this part of the republic . &quot;
the abandoned villages of the northern district in T@@ ku@@ st@@ al show striking images .
&quot; villages such as D@@ z@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha , Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , Py@@ at@@ aya Sha@@ k@@ h@@ ta , Poly@@ ana and K@@ har@@ chil@@ ava are located in the coal basin of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia . &quot;
&quot; various ethnic groups , such as Russians , Greeks , Sha@@ ha@@ zia , Geor@@ gian and Armen@@ ians , lived and worked together at Soviet times in the area . &quot;
many of them had to leave their homes during the war .
&quot; today , the majority of Russians and ab@@ hor@@ ts live in the area . &quot;
such settlements are also called ghost towns in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia .
&quot; in the pre @-@ war period , more than 10,000 people lived here , today there are only a few hundred people in these ghost towns . &quot;
this phenomenon is characteristic for t@@ k@@ arch@@ al .
&quot; since 2011 , the total population of the district has amounted to 16@@ ,000 people , after it has barely risen over a decade . &quot;
&quot; in 1989 , about 4@@ 3.000 people lived in this district . &quot;

&quot; &quot; &quot; all this is a consequence of the war &quot; &quot; &quot;
the empty five @-@ story blocks of the Soviet Union from the early 1960s called the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v kas are symbolic of the decline and devast@@ ation of the region .
the buildings are deca@@ yed and very rare they are inhabited by more than two families .

at the entrance of the village D@@ z@@ han@@ go@@ ha I met a local older man .
he starts a conversation and it is difficult for him to end this .
&quot; all this is a consequence of the war . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; can I talk to you ? &quot; &quot; why talk ? &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it is clear . &quot;
before the war the village was full of life .
&quot; there were community centers , schools and kinder@@ gar@@ tens which served all of the community . &quot;
now there is only paved road with f@@ aded splend@@ or buildings .
&quot; the people , who once lived in this place and made their contribution to the central planning economy of the Soviet Union , have now left the district . &quot;
in the ghost town of D@@ z@@ han@@ go@@ ha there are about fifty inhabitants .
&quot; about 38 people live in Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a , in the other villages it looks similar . &quot;
&quot; the K@@ hr@@ ush@@ che@@ v , which houses one or two families , can be seen on the balconies where laundry is dried . &quot;
&quot; two young girls , both seven years old , look out of the window of a destroyed house . &quot;
&quot; when they discover me with the camera in the hand , they immediately draw back . &quot;
&quot; our mother has forbidden us to take pictures , &quot; &quot; says one of the girls . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; she simply forbidden us , that &apos;s all . &quot;
the girl whis@@ pers something to her friend and suddenly she will leave the destroyed building and disappear .
many people in the area work for a small Turkish mining company called T@@ ku@@ ch@@ alu@@ go@@ l .
&quot; families are also involved in the sub@@ sistence economy ( cultivation of agricultural products for self @-@ consumption ) such as animal hus@@ band@@ ry , be@@ ekeeping and vegetable cultivation . &quot;
it &apos;s difficult to get over the rounds .
&quot; in winter , the district administration provides free candles and bread to the villages . &quot;

&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will build zu@@ cch@@ ini &quot;
&quot; about ten years ago , an older woman with the name Gal@@ ina ( or A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a , as it is called in the neighborhood ) moved from Ak@@ ar@@ mar@@ a to Dsch@@ han@@ tu@@ k@@ ha . &quot;
&quot; despite her el@@ dest daughter , who lives in France , Gal@@ ina has not left Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia to live with her . &quot; my heart will forever remain in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; Gal@@ ina does not want to receive financial help from her daughter , and she insi@@ sts that she instead supports her young grand@@ children . &quot;
Gal@@ inas monthly rent are just $ 9 .
&quot; if you have neither a vegetable garden nor a house , it is very hard to survive , &quot; she gives . &quot;
A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a tells them that they and other villa@@ gers try to meet regularly and celebrate holidays together .

&quot; a 90 year old woman as well as a young family and I live in this building .
&quot; if holidays are , we visit . &quot;
&quot; but we cannot do this constantly - everyone is busy with his own problems . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; while she tells her story , a younger neighbour appears on the balcony . &quot;
&quot; Nat@@ ascha , &quot; A@@ unt G@@ aly@@ a calls her . &quot; they said we could build zu@@ cch@@ ini . &quot;
I have already prepared the floor .
&quot; I don &apos;t know what will happen , but we will cultivate cour@@ get@@ tes . &quot;
&quot; you can get used to everything &quot;
G@@ aly@@ a &apos;s conversation partner Nat@@ ascha has lived together with her husband and the five common children in her house for some time .
Nat@@ ascha was 11 years old when the war began .
every day they commemor@@ ate the village fle@@ eing before the war .
&quot; despite the relatives living in Central Russia , Os@@ se@@ tia and Georgia ( the country of Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia was simply gone ) , they did not have the opportunity to leave . &quot;

&quot; we recently bought land in Su@@ k@@ hum@@ i ( administrative capital in Ab@@ k@@ ha@@ zia ) .
&quot; we want to build a house there , but it will take a while , &quot; &quot; she explains . &quot;
&quot; for each child , Nat@@ asha receives approximately $ 9 child benefit . &quot;
her husband is working in the coal mine .
the young family has their own farm .
&quot; near the house where Nat@@ asha &apos;s kinder@@ garten once was , they keep pigs , cows , co@@ cks and chi@@ ckens . &quot;
she tells us that it was a very sc@@ ary situation when many people left the village after the war .
but over time she lost her anxiety .

&quot; &quot; &quot; we are not afraid of the dark road or the few people . &quot;
you can get used to everything .
many people believe that these buildings have been destroyed during the war .
but actually it has something to do with lo@@ oting .
after the war there was hardly any work and all lived as they were right .
every day I remember how the city and the war were once .
&quot; when our conversation turns to an end , a little boy conf@@ esses us . &quot;
it runs through the window of a destroyed building and hides itself .
a ball flies out of the window and another boy ch@@ ases him afterwards .
he plays with the ball rolling down the hill .
a group of children now follows the ball .
&quot; while they run , some of them throw stones onto the ruined buildings . &quot;
&quot; these ruins are a part of their childhood , which ensure un@@ certain@@ ties in their lives . &quot;
they do not know it any other way .

&quot; in Mexico , &quot; Mama Africa &quot; houses migrants on their long journey &quot;
&quot; Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez leads a small hotel in Tap@@ ach@@ ula , in the state of Chi@@ ap@@ as , at the border of Mexico to Guatemala . &quot;

this article by A@@ my Bra@@ cken was published on 19 April 2017 on the website of our partner PRI@@ .org and is published here with friendly permission .
&quot; on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America , certain places are known for their hospitality . &quot;
&quot; I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tap@@ ach@@ ula , it is located on the border to Guatemala . &quot;
it is a very simple hotel close to the city centre .
&quot; led by a 59 @-@ year @-@ old Mexican woman , a small woman with a cor@@ als @-@ pink bri@@ ll@@ en@@ frame and gold @-@ colored earrings in ted@@ dy bear form . &quot;
she is called Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez and was born in Tap@@ ach@@ ula and grew up there . still they know many under the name Mama Africa .
this nick@@ name is owed to the fact that the hotel ( or rather it ) has become a target for Afri@@ cans and Hai@@ tians who are on transit .
the hotel does not have any charm .
&quot; for about 2.@@ 50 dollars the night guests sleep in simple rooms , with bare , crum@@ bling walls and beds made of metal . &quot;
in the anter@@ oom there is a par@@ rot in a cage .
there is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Hai@@ tian migrants arrive here .
&quot; sometimes , Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez , tells the people in full mini@@ buses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling : &quot; Mama Africa ! &quot;
where are you from Mama Africa ? .
&quot; at the moment , it is rather quiet , but this year Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez has received 200 guests at the same time . &quot;
&quot; there are only 24 rooms , some have also already slept on boxes outside . &quot;
she doesn &apos;t want to reject anyone .
&quot; she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill , she bu@@ ys them drugs that they cannot pay , she mass@@ aging them with a bal@@ m the feet dra@@ ined from the long journey . &quot;
&quot; Ty@@ chi@@ que Sebasti@@ ao , originally from Angola , has arrived recently . &quot;
I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nick@@ name for Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family Sebasti@@ ao ( with her daughter Mer@@ ru@@ i who has a yo@@ gh@@ ur@@ t@@ bart ) pos@@ ing with Con@@ cep@@ ci@@ Ã³n Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
the family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston .
photo : A@@ my Bra@@ cken .
&quot; yes , yes , &quot; he answers with a smile . &quot; I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women . &quot;
very loving .
she has the warmth of a mother ...
we feel very comfortable here . &quot;
Sebasti@@ ao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children .
&quot; they have lived in Brazil already , but it is for some Afri@@ cans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then pull towards the north . &quot;
&quot; the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa . &quot; &quot; Mama Africa is a well @-@ known name on the track , &quot; &quot; explains Felix Michel@@ et , a guest from Haiti . &quot;
he says that the Hai@@ tians and the Afri@@ cans often travel along the route and that Afri@@ cans are already talking about W@@ hat@@ s@@ app by Ms Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez .
&quot; like many of his companions , Michel@@ et lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup . &quot;
&quot; when the Brazilian economy was weaker , he began his journey to the United States . &quot;
he has been a guest at Mama Africa for months : he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Ti@@ juana .
I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez in the future .
&quot; Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again , &quot; he answers smiling . &quot; we will always stay in touch . &quot;
Ms. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez nar@@ rates that her guests send her often text messages when they have gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey .
she explains that her Christian faith is the pro@@ pul@@ sion of her work .
&quot; she doesn &apos;t know much about Africa , but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like Ghana . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez is perhaps very well known here , but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula . &quot;
at the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Valen@@ zu@@ ela .
&quot; this winter , Valen@@ zu@@ ela and his family have included migrants in their small house . &quot;
he is a polic@@ eman and has found that bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive .
&quot; he has begun to help them get a reasonable price , then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered . &quot;
&quot; at the moment there are 25 people , mainly Hai@@ tians . &quot;
&quot; some sleep on blankets on the floor , but at least they have electricity , a washing machine and a cooking place outside . &quot;
Valen@@ zu@@ ela explains that he knows what the guests are going through .
&quot; I have lived in the United States , &quot; he says . &quot; I have experienced what they are experiencing . &quot;
I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered .
there are places where people help and others do not help . that &apos;s why I give them my support .
&quot; after having lived there for three years , he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his work place . &quot;
&quot; the majority of migrants travelling through Tap@@ ach@@ ula comes from Central America , other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them . &quot;
JosÃ© Antonio Cor@@ do@@ va Mel@@ Ã©n@@ dez tells me he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to black@@ mail him without having a plan .
&quot; in Tap@@ ach@@ ula he asked for accommodation and an unknown , a single parent , offered him her roof . &quot;
&quot; a few months later , the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go . &quot;
back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests .
&quot; in the corri@@ dors , travelers always consult their phones . &quot;
&quot; a mini@@ bus arrived today and brought 20 new guests , a large part of Somalia . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. Ram@@ Ã­@@ rez seems happy that her house is full , but she is also nostal@@ gic , because of those who went away . &quot;

China : X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones .
&quot; a check point for personal communication devices in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang by Twitter users , where it attracts &quot;
&quot; the inhabitants of X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , an ethnic minority region in western China , are forced to install a sp@@ y@@ ware on their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; on July 10 , the mobile phone users in the Ti@@ an@@ sh@@ an district of U@@ rum@@ qi received a mobile notification in which they instruc@@ t the district government to install a monitoring app called J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang ( or &quot; Web Clean &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; in the announcement , it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information . &quot;
&quot; however , the authorities could also use the app for more than comb@@ ating terrorism . &quot;
&quot; according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia , 10 Kaz@@ ak@@ h women were arrested in the Autonom@@ ous Il@@ i Kaz@@ ak@@ h Pre@@ f@@ ecture because they , shortly after they installed the app , exchanged messages with a private We@@ Chat group . &quot;
&quot; the police reported that the app would identify and prosec@@ ute the sources and the distribution channels of the terrorists , along with &quot; illegal religious &quot; activities and &quot; harmful information , &quot; including videos , pictures , e@@ Books and documents . &quot;
J@@ ing@@ wan@@ ese &apos;s website describes the app as follows :
&quot; J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults , introduced by Ji@@ angs@@ u Telec@@ om . &quot;
&quot; the main feature is blocking por@@ no@@ graphic web pages , online fraud , tro@@ j@@ ans and ph@@ ishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network . &quot;
this app with the children &apos;s filters is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle .
an app with these functions can of course be used in many ways .
&quot; for example , the &quot; remote control &quot; could enable state actors or even h@@ ack@@ ers to manipul@@ ate or steal a person &apos;s home network . &quot;
this introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region .
&quot; while announcements about digital cens@@ orship in China tend to focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south , reality is very often darker for those who live in remote , crowded ethnic minority regions like X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang and Tibet . &quot;
&quot; in order to limit un@@ rest and dis@@ satisfaction in conflict areas , the authorities often arrange extreme measures and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shut@@ downs . &quot;
&quot; the Twitter @-@ based media outlet , &quot; Images from mainland China , &quot; published cens@@ ored news in China , showed photos from a check@@ point where polic@@ emen checked the residents in@@ discrimin@@ ately to see if they had installed the surveillance app . &quot;
the authorities in X@@ inj@@ ian make sure people use the official J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang app .
a mobile notification required people to install the app in 10 days .
&quot; if you are detected at a check@@ point with a device without this software , they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days . &quot;
this is a set@@ back for technological development .
they have forced people to use appliances intended for elderly people .
this is a form of imprisonment by the rest @-@ growth technology .
we are back in Ma@@ os China .
&quot; images from mainland China &quot; ( Red @-@ Afri@@ cans ) also published a J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang product description , from which the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and thus un@@ restricted access to the computer &apos;s hard drive . &quot;
after installing J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang computers and cell phones in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang become electronic hand@@ cu@@ ffs .
the rules in J@@ ing@@ w@@ ang may be a reaction to the orders of the City Council to minim@@ ise the dis@@ semination of illegal content .
&quot; all government branches , authorities and institutions associated with the party , including universities and research institutions , are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cyber@@ security Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices . &quot;
&quot; a recent Freedom House report , an American human rights organisation , also mentioned these new surveillance methods : &quot;
&quot; in X@@ inj@@ i@@ ang , the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of U@@ rum@@ qi , with the directive to register their &quot; personal ID cards , mobile phones , external drives , portable hard drives , not@@ ebooks and media memory cards &quot; at local police . &quot;
&quot; the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any &quot; terrorist videos , &quot; however , this action viol@@ ates the personality rights of U@@ rum@@ qu@@ is three million inhabitants and gives them pen@@ alties for a number of other possible off@@ enses , including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages . &quot;
&quot; sleep or death , part 1 : everything cries after death &quot;
a single cell in Old Dub@@ bo Ga@@ ol .

&quot; this is the first of six reports in the series &quot; sleep or death , &quot; in which the activ@@ ist Sar@@ mad Al J@@ il@@ ane described his experiences in a Syrian prison . &quot;
&quot; far from our blue , virtual world you look at yourself and realize that you are alone in a place where everything important has disappeared . &quot;
&quot; everything has gradually resolved and revealed a truth , which is clearly recognizable , both inside and outside . &quot;
one that makes all honor to their name .
a person who has fallen down into a list of feelings and expressions that do not allow metaph@@ ors .
&quot; but if reality re@@ stores you and you look behind the scenes - beyond the drama , the beautiful scenes and the performers - the characters turn into beings from flesh and blood , and everything cries out for death . &quot;
&quot; all doubts are dissolved in smoke and you will be aware of your existence , even if the Earth continues on the axis of the evil . it becomes clear to you that you are trapped between the walls that your parents , and before them your grand@@ parents , stone around stone . &quot;
&quot; they arrested me and my father three times , but that wasn &apos;t enough for me to learn &quot; &quot; my lesson &quot; , &quot; as the Chief of the Security Service formulated it - with the promise that the fourth time would be a pleasure . &quot;
he proved his power over us by destroying even the simplest concepts we knew .
five young people were torn from the beautiful garden of our revolution during a peaceful protest like dar@@ nel .
&quot; it was enough for the city to break the darkness of the night with &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; scre@@ ams . &quot;
&quot; all the districts were cov@@ eted , only my own . &quot;
&quot; for the first time it was quiet , moti@@ on@@ less , at the wrong time , even if I didn &apos;t put high demands on a city that was plu@@ gged into the arter@@ ies with state security organisms and their ac@@ compli@@ ces . &quot;
&quot; in the third night , things had a little cal@@ ming after the power supply stopped in the neighborhood . &quot;
&quot; I broke through the silence , scre@@ aming several times &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; &quot; from my house roof . &quot;
I heard my voice refu@@ te through silence .
a few minutes later some of my friends felt brave enough to get together .
I was not alone .
&quot; many friends , true friends joined me ; we joined us to a glorious picture that filled my expectations completely . &quot;
&quot; in such a moment , you are aware that you release the mind from the lamp , but it simply doesn &apos;t interest you in the least . &quot;
&quot; I received a call from my father : &quot; &quot; get ready , we meet at the military security building . &quot;
he put on .
&quot; then I learned the following : no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice , after you scre@@ amed it all the way up to the office of security service out of the body . &quot;
I arrived there .
the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an was there with several of his men ; my father was already there as I now .
&quot; the Colonel Gh@@ ass@@ an begins to speak : &quot; &quot; let me also hear how you write &quot; &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar &quot; , &quot; or you are only brave enough to scre@@ am if we are not close . &quot;
his hat@@ eful eyes turned to me .
and you really dare to look into my eyes and not on the floor !
what I did then has nothing to do with courage .
&quot; I was 18 years old , it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building . &quot;
&quot; perhaps it was about my fool@@ ish@@ ness , vanity ; perhaps in the revolution . &quot;
I was so sure of my thing when I replied : &quot; I wouldn &apos;t have thought you &apos;ve forgotten my voice since yesterday .
&quot; and I think I never stopped looking at you , so why should I do it now ? &quot;
&quot; it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me , and yet I don &apos;t regret a word of what I said . &quot;
&quot; put him in solitary confin@@ ement , and his father is equal with it . &quot;
&quot; his father equal with it . &quot;
the sten@@ ch of this accur@@ sed sentence is still in my nose .
&quot; he became a &quot; &quot; syndrome &quot; , &quot; a mental torture that I was exposed for months . &quot;
I ran through the courtyard .
in the first office I leave everything I carry with me .
&quot; then again through the farm and into the second office , which leads through a corridor leading to the individual cells . &quot;
I remember all the details carefully before I enter the room .
&quot; other than usual , they have probably assigned to me a bigger cell this time . &quot;
&quot; I have to share it with only one more prisoner , and I am allowed to sit immediately without waiting for their permission . &quot;
&quot; after a few minutes that felt like a whole life , the official left the cell , and I went back to an old proven method of communication : to fight against the wall with the fist . &quot;
&quot; I learned that my cell @-@ mate was a &quot; &quot; first @-@ keeper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
after a long hes@@ itation he finally answered me .
&quot; apparently , none of the surrounding cells lay a prominent middle @-@ aged man , who looks similar to me and is called &quot; the doctor . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in perfect darkness , no striking facial features can be seen in me , and doctors don &apos;t exist here ; we are all just numbers . &quot;
maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine ?
all the answers deny his existence .
perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells .
perhaps he will hear immediately .
the investig@@ ator had assured me that they would let him go if I stay .
liar .
I would have liked to have a scar@@ ec@@ row to drive away all these crow@@ s that lab@@ elled on the fruit in my head &apos;s garden .
&quot; from the distance , I still hear them scre@@ aming &quot; Alla@@ hu Ak@@ bar . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it must be about 10 o &apos;clock in the evening , always at this time the cries , every day . &quot;
the door opens .
&quot; I was always convinced that black was the colour of per@@ dition , until I saw the yellow light that showed us the Gre@@ ys in person : the Ra@@ ad ( e.g. : &quot; Don@@ ner , &quot; all@@ usion to the 13th Sh@@ ure of the Quran ) . &quot;
they are here to be interro@@ gated .
&quot; thus the secret was lifted : to protect the state security from us and prevent us from releasing the tra@@ itor and the terrorists in us , they speak in the Ala@@ wit@@ tic dialect - so they played out their con@@ fession@@ al ex@@ tor@@ tion card and revealed the narrow view of their world view . &quot;
&quot; here is no house , this is not a country ; it is a curse that they call co@@ existence to turn the criminals of their clan into a hero . &quot;
&quot; I enter the audi@@ torium and meet Abu Ima@@ d , a slim and sto@@ cky man ; at least he comes to me like that . &quot;
&quot; he starts a &quot; pleasant &quot; conversation , in spite of the facial expressions that slip on him : &quot; my boy , you are still young , you can start so much more important with your life than join this diary and protest against demonstrations that will soon come to an end . &quot;
I didn &apos;t answer .
I have used it to not answer .
I can no longer say exactly when insul@@ ts and pun@@ ches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation .
when and how it happened was un@@ important .
&quot; some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished , though I had nothing to earn this punishment . &quot;
punishment in all its diversity .
his command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body .
he calls the aff@@ ection@@ ate &quot; confession . &quot;
it starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the clo@@ aks .
your exec@@ ution@@ er rejo@@ ices in your cry .
&quot; give him the pleasure , you cannot measure yourself with him , and you cannot hold back your cries . &quot;
&quot; my cries were not enough for him , why they exchanged the pipe through a cable . &quot;
&quot; during my first arrest , I wondered if the investig@@ ator had previously worked as a garbage collector , or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment . &quot;
they had inter@@ tw@@ ined four cables to show us the great invention of a giant cable from their point of view .
within a single hour three of them changed while I was still in the row .
&quot; I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice , which is why I listened to scre@@ am . &quot;
&quot; the exec@@ ution@@ er noticed the cooling , and found no favor in it , which is why he interven@@ ed as the next to an electrically charged rod . &quot;
&quot; electricity flow@@ ed my whole body , enough to supply my whole district . &quot;
my half @-@ naked body lying on the ground was the perfect conductor .
the num@@ b@@ ness disappeared and the pain was back .
after two terrible hours he decided that he had fulfilled his duty for that night .
it must have been around midnight .
I decided to sleep again ; let &apos;s say that was my only option .
some hours passed which seemed to me like minutes .
then the call to the morning prayer .
&quot; the door opens and the morning light fills the room . &quot; &quot; look with you , Ar@@ sch@@ fi@@ cker . &quot;
&quot; I answer with the voice of an exhausted youth : &quot; my Lord , my father must be fear@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; be quiet and move away , you will be moved . &quot;
that was new .
otherwise they always had let me go .
where do they lead me ? !
&quot; the Jord@@ anian R@@ apper Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b speaks about the rights of LG@@ BT@@ Q + community , freedom of expression and resistance &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b smoked a cigarette in his studio .
&quot; the photo was taken by A@@ man Mad@@ an , the original author of this text . &quot;
Em@@ sal@@ lam H@@ da@@ i@@ b spends most of his time indoors ; sometimes he travels to his canvas to his computer and back to his couch .
&quot; but what you can rely on is a cigarette between his fingers , or his lips with ni@@ cot@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; he lives in the top floor of his family house , which has been part of them since 1967 ; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and H@@ da@@ i@@ bs family forced to flee from their village in Palestine , in which they had lived as fel@@ ic@@ ye@@ witnesses ( e.g. Far@@ mer ) . &quot;
&quot; for six years now , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has been a passionate activ@@ ist opposing the conservative majority and questioning its well @-@ established views on gender roles , sexu@@ ality and freedom of expression through art and rap@@ es@@ eed . &quot;
&quot; with his music , which often deals with subjects like Ori@@ ent@@ alism , racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees , he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world . &quot;
&quot; with his 25 years , H@@ da@@ i@@ b sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his thinking , and he can sympath@@ ize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq , Yemen , Syria and Libya . &quot;
&quot; even if he does not admit it openly , he has a special reluct@@ ance against American foreign policy . &quot;
H@@ da@@ i@@ b considers his art in his studio in Am@@ man .
taken by the author .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones , have anything to do with his identity as &quot; Palestinian f@@ lar@@ ed by the second generation &quot; - so he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think about my own circumstances so much , &quot; &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; then he adds : &quot; I think so , because I am a man , &quot; while he poured out Nes@@ cafÃ© in water in two cups . it is the holy month of Ram@@ adan ; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset . &quot;
the Jord@@ anian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ram@@ adan is illegal .
&quot; obviously , H@@ da@@ i@@ b has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions ; on the other hand , a cup of coffee on a fer@@ ring hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam . &quot;
&quot; basically , the slu@@ dge of lu@@ ke@@ warm coffee and the wa@@ v@@ ds of the K@@ ent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom . &quot;
&quot; sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky , especially when you look into neighbouring countries . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is easy to do basic things - as in the public while drinking water - in order not to land in prison . &quot;
&quot; recently , Jordan &apos;s Ministry of Interior has cancelled a performance by the band M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la , for the second time . &quot;
&quot; some MPs who support the Islamic campaign front - the Jord@@ anian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the hom@@ osexual fron@@ ts@@ man Ham@@ ed Sinn@@ o , contradic@@ ts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert . &quot;
&quot; the deputy and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dim@@ a Tah@@ bou@@ b said in an interview with CN@@ N that the concert &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; was cancelled because of the singer &apos;s sexual orientation . &quot;
&quot; many also claim that the band &apos;s commitment in matters such as Arab Spring , human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activ@@ ism , which poses the proven legi@@ timacy of authorit@@ arian regimes across the region . &quot;
&quot; in a public statement , M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la estimated the Jord@@ anian people as &quot; progressive supporters of human rights , &quot; who continue to choose &quot; for an intellectual and cultural pl@@ ur@@ alism . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhet@@ oric , but in fact reflect an ever more clearly cryst@@ alli@@ zing reality in Jordan , which clearly appears in H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s work . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b turned back traditional sex men to Lei@@ be , forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have pre@@ mar@@ ital sex . &quot;
&quot; the picture shows the skel@@ eton of an apparently worn unknown woman , whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas . &quot;
&quot; it is surrounded by a red lake , perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust . &quot;
&quot; in the past few years , the number of &apos; honorary cur@@ es &apos; has increased in Jordan - the un@@ official outside of Jordan . &quot;
&quot; according to human rights Watch , the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak ; however , it is still difficult to add that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate manner . &quot;
&quot; according to a crime against crime from 1954 , women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can &quot; &quot; be kept in prison in@@ definitely , &quot; &quot; and for their release , it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the family &apos;s guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman . &quot;
also H@@ da@@ i@@ bs music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from subjects which are long as tab@@ oos in his country .
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b den@@ ies that his work is political , but ad@@ mits that he cannot separate his music , which is full of explicit references to sexu@@ ality , freedom and expression , not from politics . &quot;
&quot; I come from the Middle East , man . &quot;
&quot; I was introduced to politics , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in a song called &quot; Edward Sa &apos;@@ ed , &quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b attacks the question of Palestinian identity . &quot;
&quot; in &quot; &quot; Law@@ la al 3@@ ai@@ b &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Gh@@ are@@ eb &quot; , &quot; the focus is on poverty . &quot;
the list of songs that are political in the core can be continued .
&quot; in March 2016 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b released a song entitled &quot; Sant@@ and@@ ano . &quot; &quot;
in this song a verse is repeated stri@@ k@@ ingly often :
&quot; you are free , and everyone else is it . &quot;
&quot; in the further course of the song H@@ da@@ i@@ b describes the world as a kind of market where one can , in his words , &quot; get what you want &quot; - be it faith or non @-@ belief , hetero@@ gen@@ eity or homosexu@@ ality . &quot;
he noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and les@@ bians and that comments on the equality of LG@@ BT@@ Q + individuals were still heavily cens@@ ored by 2014 .
&quot; in 2014 , H@@ da@@ i@@ b conducted an interview for the popular Jord@@ anian online program Ro@@ ya , to later note that his comments were torn from the context , twisted and in his opinion were cens@@ ored . &quot;
&quot; on You@@ tube it was uploaded without cuts , but stre@@ amed only a edited version , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; today , H@@ da@@ i@@ b is openly campaig@@ ning for the Arab LG@@ BT@@ Q + community and believes that intoler@@ ance to homosexu@@ als is not contrary to Islam . &quot;
&quot; he men@@ tions Abu Nu@@ what , a poet of the eighth century , who has remained in memory even today thanks to his homo@@ erotic poems . &quot;
&quot; H@@ da@@ i@@ b asks himself : if Abu Nu@@ what , who was to work later on behalf of the cali@@ ph , could write openly about homosexu@@ ality in the eighth century , why can Jord@@ ani@@ ans not ? &quot;
&quot; the real problem , so H@@ da@@ i@@ b , has nothing to do with M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la or the fact that the concert was cancelled . &quot;
&quot; in the H@@ ash@@ em@@ ite Kingdom , it is nothing new that the government sanc@@ tioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; recently , in January 2017 , the Jord@@ anian news service established several former government officials and members of the teacher &apos;s association , stating that they have critically challenged comments in social media about the problems associated with the corruption deeply rooted in the country . &quot;
&quot; in view of this , H@@ da@@ i@@ bs &apos;s opinion is , according to this , only the tip of the ic@@ e@@ berg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jord@@ ani@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; for him , progress is a constant giving and taking . Jordan has now denied M@@ ash@@ ro@@ u &apos; Lei@@ la for the second time in a row , but the path of progress - so it looks H@@ da@@ i@@ b - consists of slow , thou@@ ghtful and internal changes . &quot;
&quot; ultimately H@@ da@@ i@@ b , like millions of other Arabs , dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad . &quot;
&quot; he does not only dream of bringing his work to Bag@@ h@@ dad , Jerusalem and Damascus , but also of experiencing &quot; it . &quot; &quot;
&quot; perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music , art and literature - and not by bombs , scattered uni@@ forms and arti@@ fici@@ ally induced demo@@ cra@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; until the time has come , H@@ da@@ i@@ b will continue to ra@@ p and therefore resist . &quot;
this report was made possible by the Pul@@ itzer Center on Crisis Reporting which was attended by A@@ man as student Fel@@ low .
Neb@@ uta in A@@ om@@ ori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan .
&quot; these big , extravag@@ ant warri@@ ors dolls are so fantastic ! ! ! &quot;
there are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Neb@@ uta festival .
&quot; it is believed that it is a variation of the Tan@@ ab@@ ata festival , which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of T@@ oh@@ ok@@ us . another theory states that the for@@ lor@@ ries , the drums and dancing have mar@@ ched over more than a thousand years , to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region , the Em@@ ishi , to their knees . &quot;
we are at the Neb@@ uta festival in A@@ om@@ ori .
&quot; we were able to grab some great seats , so we have a great view . &quot;
one can hardly imagine how large these parts are ...
&quot; a community centre in the capital , Meg@@ uro Ga@@ jo@@ en , organized a two @-@ month exhibition on W@@ a no Ak@@ ari ( literally ) . &quot;
I have been looking for the Meg@@ uro gau@@ jo@@ en for a long time : two for@@ ts are just to be seen .
&quot; nevertheless , for many people who take the journey to A@@ om@@ ori , the Neb@@ uta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer : &quot;
&quot; Y@@ att@@ em@@ are !
Y@@ att@@ em@@ are ! &quot; summer festival in the north of the country .
I was there and watched the # Neb@@ ut@@ a@@ Festival .
the sight of an 18 meter high car was incredible .
let us enjoy the rest of the summer !
young Peru@@ vi@@ ans exchange arms against sciss@@ ors and raz@@ ors

&quot; rarely , outer appearances and personal care were as important as in this story , because they help keep the Peru@@ vian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hair@@ dres@@ ser . &quot;
&quot; El Cal@@ la@@ o , Peru &apos;s most important port , is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean , close to the historic center of Lima , a region with a very high crime rate where street smoking and illegal drug trafficking are everyday . &quot;
a survey published in April 2017 showed that 5@@ 1.5 per cent of the population of this region will not feel safe .
&quot; at the same time , Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men . &quot;
&quot; the trend , appearance and thus also the unusual hair@@ styles of famous athletes such as Paolo Gu@@ err@@ ero ( Peru ) , Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( Peru ) , Pedro Gall@@ ese ( Peru ) , or N@@ ey@@ mar ( Brazil ) , has led to becoming more and more regular citizens in the hands of hair@@ dres@@ sers that can recre@@ ate these elaborate hair@@ styles . &quot;
&quot; the unprecedented demand for hair@@ styles , which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity , has even inspired an annual event , the competition of hair@@ dres@@ sers &quot; Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os , &quot; which has been taking place since 2014 . &quot;
experts compete against each other to show who can create the most ec@@ centric looks as you can see in the following video ( further videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Bat@@ alla de Bar@@ ber@@ os ) .
&quot; educational institutions such as the school of August@@ o Sal@@ azar Bon@@ dy , located in El Cal@@ la@@ o , found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hair@@ dressing tools and to receive training in hair@@ dres@@ sers in place of bad advice that allows them to find work . &quot;
&quot; motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered , dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion . &quot;
the school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes :
&quot; in 1995 , we were the only specialized school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud , because we have built this educational community out of love for the children . &quot;
Colombia : sec@@ uri@@ tis@@ ation letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters

&quot; the following article is the edited version of the &quot; declaration of love for guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , &quot; published by the international online magazine Tea After T@@ wel@@ ve . &quot;
the article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Vo@@ ices .
why do we only write love letters to people we know ?
&quot; is it not even more important , people who feel ex@@ tor@@ ted to meet affection ? &quot;
&quot; this was precisely the question of the young Colom@@ bian activ@@ ist Leonardo P@@ Ã¡r@@ ra@@ ga from the Bo@@ got@@ Art Foundation and Cr@@ istian Pal@@ aci@@ os from the Young Youth Foundation , inspired by the Young Youth Foundation , encouraging young people to write letters to guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters . &quot;
&quot; recently , their country was the setting of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their share to this : after years of negotiations , the Colom@@ bian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guer@@ ri@@ lla movement F@@ ARC ( German : revolutionary Ar@@ med Forces of Colombia ) , which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; internationally , the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colom@@ bian President JosÃ© Manuel San@@ tos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; before the Colom@@ bians , however , there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace . &quot;
&quot; guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , who have lived in illegal camps for many years , have been exposed to war rhet@@ oric and have carried their arms around the clock , must now re@@ integrate themselves into life as civilians . &quot;
&quot; in turn , Colom@@ bian society , which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters , has to take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life . &quot;
Leonardo and Cr@@ istian were convinced that the young Colom@@ bians would join together and help in the integration process .
&quot; and that &apos;s exactly what they did : so far , thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters in order to welcome them back in society . &quot;
the aim of the campaign is 6@@ 900 letters - one for every former guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter - which should then be handed over personally .
Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day as inspiration for the campaign
&quot; the idea for the Let@@ ters to Recon@@ ci@@ liation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Lau@@ re@@ ates , which took place in Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ in February 2017 . Leonardo and Cr@@ istian had the opportunity to talk briefly with K@@ ail@@ ash Sat@@ yar@@ thi , who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; this stated that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love , but forget those who need it much more . &quot;
&quot; he plans , he told us to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year . &quot;
&quot; the letters will show that Colom@@ bian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace , &quot; they say . &quot;
&quot; until now , more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign . &quot;
&quot; the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia , such as Cal@@ i , Man@@ iz@@ ales , Med@@ ell@@ Ã­n , Bar@@ ran@@ qu@@ illa and Bo@@ got@@ Ã¡ . &quot;
I would never have thought someone would forgive me
the first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Cal@@ don@@ o Cau@@ ca region on 19 March .
&quot; a group of 40 students from the University of Ja@@ veri@@ ana in Cal@@ i , two members of the municipal administration of Cal@@ i and Leonardo from the Bo@@ got@@ Art foundation , travelled to the camp to hand over the letters personally . &quot;
&quot; the members of the F@@ ARC were in the same way as they had done before , in order to accept the orders of their leaders . &quot;
&quot; but this time they did not receive orders , but letters full of support from people from all over the country . &quot;
&quot; it was a very moving moment for everyone involved . &quot; it &apos;s incredible how many different feelings can be tra@@ vers@@ ed in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between , &quot; explained the political science student Manu@@ ela Jim@@ Ã©@@ ne@@ z A@@ vil@@ a later . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Par@@ ra , an employee of the Gover@@ nor of the province of Valle del Cau@@ ca described this unforgettable experience so : &quot;
&quot; after passing the letters , a former fighter took me through the camp of the guer@@ illa fighters . &quot;
&quot; when I entered one of the &quot; &quot; Cam@@ illo &quot; &quot; ( a kind of cottage where the guer@@ ri@@ lla fighters are living ) I saw a guer@@ ri@@ lla fighter who wrote something . &quot;
&quot; I was afraid to go down , because beside him on the bed was a M@@ GL @-@ Pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ate , a deadly weapon in the Sle@@ eping Beauty . &quot;
&quot; and I said to him , &quot; &quot; Hello , what are you doing ? &quot; &quot; he answered , &quot; &quot; I answer a letter that someone wrote to me . &quot;
it is a very beautiful and hop@@ eful letter .
&quot; never before in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful , so I answer . &quot;
I hu@@ gged him quite firmly and sat down beside the pom@@ eg@@ ran@@ ates .
&quot; perhaps he too was tired of the war , tired of being all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter , and wanted to help him write this letter . &quot;
the man told me more about his life . he never had any other life expected as a war . join the F@@ ARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before star@@ vation . &quot; I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes .
but now I know there is a society outside that wa@@ its for us with open arms .
&quot; until now , I have learned only how to deal with weapons . &quot;
&quot; but now where peace reign@@ s , I can learn many things and work in dignity . &quot;
new voices and voices
&quot; at the start , students and some leaders of the F@@ ARC were invited to a discussion board . &quot;
the students were all grown up as already a war and the F@@ ARC already acted in secret .
&quot; this is why the leaders of the F@@ ARC have declared the history of the organization , their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process : &quot; for many years , we have seen how social injustice is working on the whole Colom@@ bian people . &quot;
&quot; the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles , &quot; one of them said . &quot;
Manu@@ ela was impressed :
&quot; hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote , and realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings turned around by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me . &quot;
&quot; the reality in which the country lives , hur@@ ts me . &quot;
&quot; but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage , can teach us something and give a smile and a hu@@ g . &quot;
many former fighters have responded to the letters .
&quot; Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , the command@@ ant of the camp in Cal@@ don@@ o @-@ Cau@@ ca , wrote for example Dar@@ Ã­@@ o de Jes@@ Ãº@@ s Mon@@ sal@@ ve , Archbishop of the town of Cal@@ i , following letter : &quot;
the Colom@@ bians were prophes@@ ied that after the dis@@ armament peace would rule .
but this is not the case .
&quot; as long as there is inequality , hunger and lack of education , health care and employment opportunities , there will always be people ready to resort to arms , lift up and protest for their rights . and this is also totally justified ( ... ) . &quot;
&quot; we of the F@@ ARC now rely on peace , on a policy without weapons . &quot;
&quot; that is why we call all def@@ enders of peace - no matter what race , religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war . &quot;
&quot; we give you our word , make our contribution and bring sacrifices , because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy . those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties ahead . &quot;
&quot; on our way there will be many obstacles , but together we will overcome them . &quot;

&quot; hom@@ osexual and que@@ er people living in the Cau@@ cas@@ us region are exposed to a wide range of dangers - including discrimination , physical and sexual violence and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; with terror , activists have witnessed the reports of recent months about the persecution of gay men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
but the threat that hangs over the LG@@ BT@@ Q community there is not just over night .
&quot; OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a trans@@ sexual woman from Gros@@ ny , who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what happened in the republic . &quot;
&quot; the LG@@ BT@@ Q legal situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya won the international head@@ lines several months ago , after reports have been published that address the kidn@@ apping , torture and killing of que@@ er men in the republic . &quot;
the first report was published by journalist Elena Mil@@ asch@@ ina in Now@@ aya Gaz@@ eta ; she put a light on the methods of Che@@ chen authorities who took suspi@@ cious que@@ er men and put them in secret pris@@ ons in ar@@ gun .
&quot; you brought a monster to the world &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina , a trans@@ gender woman , was born in Gros@@ ny and grew up there . &quot;
&quot; since childhood , she felt that she was actually a woman . &quot;
&quot; when she was grown up , she became aware that Ch@@ echn@@ ya was not a safe place for her , so she moved to Moscow . &quot;
&quot; after a group of Ch@@ ech@@ ens had experienced the gender equality of their land@@ lady , the hunt for Sab@@ rina was opened . &quot;
&quot; from fear of her life , she moved to the USA in the last analysis . &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I was a volunteer in a human rights organisation .
one day I was told that someone needed my help .
&quot; it was a friend from Da@@ gest@@ an , a woman who was in trouble . &quot;
&quot; she had no money , so I took her without hes@@ itation . &quot;
&quot; while I tried to help her , someone from whom I thought he would be a friend , a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet , with my phone number and a picture of me . he sent her to his Che@@ chen friends , with the following message : &quot; &quot; then there are no men in Ch@@ echn@@ ya that can eliminate this shame ? &quot;
after that the photos of my documents through W@@ hat@@ s@@ App made the round .
on 10 October 2015 I was attacked .
&quot; when I was just about getting a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car , I heard a male voice saying , &quot; &quot; Here is a gift for you from your un@@ cle . &quot;
&quot; when I turned around , I felt something in my body , but I did nothing . &quot;
&quot; then I heard another sentence , but this time in Ch@@ echn@@ ya : &quot; &quot; how long do you want to ad@@ ore the family , you sn@@ are ? &quot;
I didn &apos;t know the person .
&quot; I only know that it was a young man , not 30 years old . &quot;
then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital .
apparently some women had all got along and started scre@@ aming .
the man had fled .
the women had called an ambul@@ ance .
&quot; in the hospital , I learned that I had two bite wounds in my right lung . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : in which wings were you laid , in which men or women ? &quot;
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my documents are outdated , there is still my male name on it , but the doctor understood and put me to the women . &quot;
I am very thank@@ ful for that .
&quot; when I first read his name at his office door , I was afraid to do it ; it was a Muslim , a Cau@@ ca@@ sian name . &quot;
but he turned out to be a good person .
I am grateful to him for being respect@@ ful with me .
I spent more than a month in the hospital .
last February I received threats .
&quot; they called me , wrote me - relatives , strangers , some completely unknown . &quot;
that was the beginning of a night@@ mare .
my family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives .
&quot; they asked me to send me back to Ch@@ echn@@ ya , to prove that it was all a lie . &quot;
&quot; they presented absurd demands : some said to me , I must prove it by walking up without through the streets ; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Gros@@ ny and say that I had not changed my sex , that all was just bad speech , and Photos@@ hop . &quot;
I have grain size C - what should I say on TV ?
OC Media : how did your family try to deal with this pressure ?
Sab@@ rina : it &apos;s still hard for them .
some elderly people once said my mother on the street .
&quot; they said to her , &quot; &quot; You brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family , but the entire republic . &quot;
&quot; we cannot touch you because you are a pi@@ ous woman , but you must disappear from here . &quot;
in my mother it became too much and she lay down a rope around her neck .
&quot; thank@@ fully , the neighbors came and saved them . &quot;
at that time I had to change the apartment several times a day .
&quot; I moved to an apartment and a few hours later , under the window stood a car with dark@@ ened window pan@@ es and a number plate with a 95 on it . &quot;
&quot; after it happened for the third time , it became clear to me that there was something rotten . &quot;
my human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted .
OC Media : how did you flee ?
Sab@@ rina : with the help of activists .
&quot; for security reasons I don &apos;t want to give up their names , but I want to say that I remember them all ; they really helped me . &quot;
&quot; with her help , I left the country , but then something incredible happened . &quot;
I can still not understand how it could be .
shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived .
&quot; I bought them without registering , without notice , without notice . &quot;
I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the tr@@ ash .
arrived and checked into the hotel .
the number had been registered to a stranger .
I put the SIM card into my mobile phone .
&quot; at the moment I wanted to call my mother via W@@ hat@@ s@@ App , I got a message : &quot; &quot; you don &apos;t believe you &apos;re in security , just because you have left the country ? &quot;
our people already know which hotel you are hiding in . you even know your room number .
only to prove it to you : it is number 115 .
can you imagine that ? !
that was actually my room number .
OC Media : are you still in contact with your family ?
Sab@@ rina : only with my mother and my sisters .
&quot; however , we don &apos;t talk about gender equality , this is a t@@ abo@@ o topic . &quot;
I still carry some traditional Cau@@ ca@@ sian elements in me .
&quot; as much as I wish , I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier . &quot;
&quot; I always say that as long as my mother is alive , I will do my best to not hurt her . &quot;
&quot; when we chat with camera , I actually try to look at how the person looks at which they remember from their past - so to my male form . &quot;
but that is very difficult .
OC Media : do you know something about the current situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya ?
&quot; what do your friends , those who have stayed there ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I submitted a report in Washington last week .
&quot; for him , I needed up @-@ to @-@ date information on the situation in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
I talked to someone who had lunch for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
&quot; he said that during Ram@@ adan , no people were arrested and tortured , but also that all the end of Ram@@ adan could hardly wait and he did not lock a new wave . &quot;
most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives .
&quot; with this I mean , they probably charge the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand proof that the so @-@ called &quot; honor &quot; has experienced through blood satisfaction . &quot;
OC Media : are you still wearing gay men in these secret pris@@ ons ?
Sab@@ rina : a friend of mine says there aren &apos;t very many .
&quot; if , then , especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to surrender to Kad@@ y@@ rows . &quot;
&quot; as far as I know , they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later . &quot;
&quot; say , &quot; &quot; If they are killed , they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base . &quot;
do you understand ?
&quot; as if these people were not simply gone , they were specifically sub@@ merged in order to radic@@ alise . &quot;
&quot; OC Media : is that just a guess , or do you have a source for this information ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in ar@@ gun .
he says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown .
there has been nothing new ever since .
they just took them along .
&quot; and this so @-@ called Lord , this person was there when these people were taken . &quot;
&quot; until now , however , they were not presented as ban@@ dits , but there have been no reports about it yet . however , we suspect that such actions are possible . &quot;
why would you not have allowed these people to shave ?
do you know if these persec@@ utions and kidn@@ app@@ ings of people who belong to so @-@ called &quot; non @-@ traditional &quot; orientation have already occurred in the past ?
Sab@@ rina : I &apos;ve always wore my hair long .
in Ch@@ echn@@ ya I had a Bob .
&quot; I think , already before 2003 , I was already known all over Gros@@ ny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems . &quot;
in Ernst !
&quot; even from 1998 to 1999 , when Sh@@ aria was considered , I never had any problems . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was much safer than now . &quot;
&quot; Russia originally intended to lead us to &quot; civil@@ isation , &quot; but ultimately thrown us back into the Stone Age . &quot;
OC Media : how is this possible under the Sh@@ aria law ?
&quot; Sab@@ rina : my ey@@ eb@@ rows were plu@@ cked ; I had colored eyel@@ ashes , wore tubes jeans and short tops . &quot;
the Ministry of Safety of Sh@@ aria has never bent me on a hair .
&quot; in front of the Russian theatre in Gros@@ ny there was a place where every evening , especially on weekends , a whole group of people met me . &quot;
&quot; it was a small place where several banks stood , and the whole city knew about it ; they knew why men , young people met there . &quot;
we have never been offen@@ ded .
&quot; in the Che@@ chen language there is a saying : &quot; &quot; K@@ har@@ da ma K@@ har@@ da . that is , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t think about the mis@@ fortune of another . &quot; &quot; &quot;
they often say to children when they make fun of the sick .
&quot; OC Media : so they just closed their eyes to you , because they believed you were ill ? &quot;
Sab@@ rina : yes .
&quot; they never insul@@ ted me , never hun@@ ted and never beaten . &quot;
OC Media : how long did this time of grace pause ?
Sab@@ rina : so long until Kad@@ y@@ rov stepped on the plan .
&quot; when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005 , he began talking about morality on television . &quot;
&quot; he spoke not about us per se , but above all about the behaviour of women . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , you could feel how people started to change in the city . &quot;
&quot; those who had laugh@@ ed and laugh@@ ed before , looked at you at once with suspicion . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , I left Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; but every time I came back home , I could feel how the situation in the republic grew steadily . &quot;
OC Media : what activity do you follow now ?
Sab@@ rina : I work as a wa@@ it@@ ress .
I don &apos;t earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US .
&quot; apart from that , I am still active as an activ@@ ist . &quot;
currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women .
I communicate with them as a kind of psych@@ ologist .
&quot; we organize teas , gather@@ ings , I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get meal tickets . &quot;
I don &apos;t have a cent for it .
I have discovered these people themselves when I kl@@ ap@@ per@@ te influ@@ x .
I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help .
OC Media : do you wear a Hid@@ sch@@ ab ?
Sab@@ rina : that is sil@@ ly .
&quot; so nature is , it has nothing to do with religion . &quot;
&quot; this is exactly the same as ech@@ oes who want to make you white with foam before the mouth , that there are no bo@@ bb@@ ins with them . &quot;
&quot; the Da@@ gest@@ an ones have what the cab@@ ard@@ ines have , the Russians also have which ; on the whole planet they exist - but &quot; not in Ch@@ echn@@ ya . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I come from there , so it makes me uncomfortable to hear something like that . &quot;
I meet so many men from the Cau@@ cas@@ us here .
many of them - practicing Muslims who walk in the mosque and fasting during Ram@@ adan - live together with men .
&quot; you know , many think about the identity of men who love men , and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences . but this is a fall@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling , to be exact , different life attitudes . &quot;
for me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not feel ashamed of my body .
not whether I have a partner or not .
sorry I &apos;m going to be so personal here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago .
and I am not sad at all . I just know that I am now myself .
local groups warn of an increase in suicide in the im@@ pover@@ ished Arab An@@ a@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran
the Iranian territory suffers from an un@@ usually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population .
&quot; since the last few months , there has been a strong increase in suicide . &quot;
the photograph of the Arab workers in Iran was provided by the Patri@@ otic Arab Democratic Movement in Ah@@ wa@@ z .
photo : use with permission .
&quot; the self @-@ combustion of a man named J@@ assi@@ m Mor@@ amaz@@ i on August 27 brought the desperate situation of the Arab An@@ a@@ wa@@ zi community in Iran , characterized by poverty and unemployment , into the spotlight . &quot;
Mor@@ amaz@@ i was married and had a child ; he lived in Al @-@ Tha@@ w@@ ra in the region of Ah@@ wa@@ z in the south @-@ west of Iran .
&quot; he suffered under anxiety , depression , and he was ashamed of his own hel@@ pl@@ essness , the inability for his family to be able to work in Ah@@ wa@@ z , who would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
a video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he lit up himself .
&quot; some people quickly managed to extingu@@ ish the flames , and Mor@@ amaz@@ i was taken to Tal@@ e@@ gh@@ ani hospital in the city of Ah@@ wa@@ z . &quot;
&quot; according to local sources , the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore . &quot;
he died a short time later .
&quot; it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arabic Ah@@ wa@@ zi minority , and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives . &quot;
&quot; the Ah@@ wa@@ zi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Ham@@ id Mani@@ at , Ali Haz@@ ba@@ wi , Sa@@ yed Fal@@ ah M@@ ous@@ sa@@ wi and Sha@@ hab Ban@@ i Tam@@ im . &quot;
&quot; their stories have one thing in common : they were all family fathers , who felt hel@@ pless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government . &quot;
&quot; Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi suffer from poverty , unemployment and discrimination &quot;
&quot; the region , where much of the Arab population living in Iran is based , has been sha@@ ken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living . &quot;
&quot; a century ago , the Arab An@@ a@@ wa@@ z was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the P@@ ah@@ lav@@ i monarchy assumed power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran . &quot;
&quot; in the Ah@@ wa@@ z region , there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran , as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable uses for Iranian agriculture . &quot;
&quot; despite these valuable resources , the regional economy continues to develop slowly , and the local population only gets little of this wealth . &quot;
&quot; it is often a victim of untreated disease , famine and de@@ priv@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Iranian regime systematically den@@ ies the Ah@@ wa@@ zi @-@ Arabs in the local oil , gas and petro@@ chemical industries . &quot;
&quot; the government has also built a large number of dam@@ s , the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian countryside , where the provinces of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Y@@ az@@ d , Ker@@ man and G@@ ho@@ m lie . &quot;
&quot; these dam@@ s have only led to ag@@ grav@@ ate the devast@@ ation caused in the region by dr@@ y@@ ness , and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry . &quot;
the unemployment rate among the Arab a@@ haw@@ zi @-@ adolescents now increased to 81 % .
&quot; N@@ our Mohammed P@@ ur , the Iranian general director for co@@ operatives , work and social welfare , reported that 5 % of the Ah@@ wa@@ z@@ is who are looking for a job completed primary school , 55 % have finished secondary school and 45 % have a university degree . &quot;
a &quot; systematic strategy ... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance
&quot; Kar@@ im Do@@ him@@ i , a Iranian human rights activ@@ ist with a resident in London , said Global Vo@@ ices that the current situation , a mixture of &quot; poverty , unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination , &quot; leads to a &quot; high rise &quot; of the number of suicide among young Ah@@ wa@@ zi men . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is a combination of a high number of ethnic Per@@ si@@ ans and an anti @-@ Arab discrimination . &quot;
&quot; since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers , the local Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors . &quot;
&quot; this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime , aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside of their homeland . &quot;
&quot; there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ah@@ wa@@ zi and to be hired as even Arabic names at the workplace are not tolerated , let alone speak of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing . &quot;
&quot; given the circumstances that the Arab Ah@@ wa@@ zi has to endure , human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive . &quot;
it remains to be seen whether the world is w@@ aking up and taking note of it .
the main reason for suicide is untreated depression .
depression is treat@@ able and suicide is avoid@@ able .

&quot; why I don &apos;t identify with femin@@ ism , nor with inter@@ sec@@ tional &quot;
detail of a photo . taken by : Pix@@ ab@@ ay . released under the CC@@ 0 Creative Com@@ mons License .
the following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ay@@ om@@ ide Zur@@ i and was originally published on the Af@@ ro@@ f@@ Ã©@@ min@@ as website .
you can read in the comments below the original text .
&quot; when I say that I am not a feminist , many women - especially white women , who call themselves as inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists , react with fru@@ stration . &quot;
they wonder why I am not part of the movement .
they even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all fem@@ inists * within .
&quot; for example , women today still earn less money than men today despite equal education . &quot;
that women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they can do with their body .
that violence against women is a global epide@@ mic .
&quot; or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women face a glass ceiling earlier or later in various areas of life , and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and denom@@ inations . &quot;
all this is aware and well @-@ known to me .
&quot; I am convinced , and I suffer double and triple . &quot;
I am a black woman .
&quot; and yet , when I come to speak on skin colour , on racism , on black women &apos;s women , black women in the LG@@ B@@ TI@@ Q community or on black women from the Dias@@ por@@ a ; if I mention how we have always been ab@@ used in racial separation and discrimination , both in and outside the feminist movement , many white fem@@ inists decide to remain silent . &quot;
&quot; but all agree that women - all women - should come together to &quot; &quot; lift up their voices &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Kum@@ ba@@ ya , my Lord , &quot; &quot; to achieve equal rights ( some ) of women . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t want to talk about that , in addition to sexu@@ alised violence , there is an institution@@ alised form of racial @-@ motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways . &quot;
or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women .
&quot; that black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls , due to obvious integration problems . &quot;
or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women .
&quot; on the one hand , I want all women , all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights ; on the other hand , as a black woman , I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands , who refuses to take into account injusti@@ ces in her thinking , which relate to both the sex and the skin color of a person . &quot;
&quot; I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white @-@ feminist sphere , which has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 51 , So@@ jour@@ ner compla@@ ined in her speech : &quot; am I not a woman ? &quot; and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a de@@ human@@ ised and margin@@ alized being . &quot;
&quot; I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropri@@ ation , in order to expe@@ dite their ego@@ centric programme . &quot;
&quot; I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overl@@ apping skin colour and gender , because some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement , no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better . &quot;
&quot; although inter@@ sec@@ tional femin@@ ism was founded to give women different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white femin@@ ism , still the word &quot; femin@@ ism &quot; is still in its name . &quot;
&quot; I prefer to release myself completely from femin@@ ism and join the movement of wom@@ an@@ ism , which has been created for my dark skin and status as a woman , rather than engaging me for a white @-@ feminist paradigm that is so persistent that inter@@ sec@@ tion@@ ality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon . &quot;
now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres that are created by us .
&quot; Cl@@ enor@@ a Hudson @-@ We@@ ems , the author of the book Afri@@ cana wom@@ anism : how we can defend ourselves ) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way . and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be totally safe and in which the cultural , spiritual , emotional , physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman . &quot;
&quot; although some white and inter@@ sec@@ tional fem@@ inists immediately call separ@@ atism and exclusion after reading these lines , I ask you to inform yourself of the hypo@@ cris@@ y and the contradictions of feminist movement , of which the black woman is affected . &quot;
&quot; in a wom@@ an@@ istic environment , I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist . &quot;
I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman .
&quot; I , a black woman , can flour@@ ish in an environment where my life has neither passed over nor ignored , nor rejected . &quot;
p@@ add@@ ling against pollution : a man &apos;s mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations
&quot; this post by To@@ dd Reu@@ bold was originally published on En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine that has recently reported on international efforts to solve environmental problems . &quot;
&quot; as part of a content sharing agreement , this article will be published again . &quot;
&quot; again and again , Nab@@ il Mus@@ a travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with sur@@ f@@ board or can@@ oe - with a special concern for the Kurdist@@ an Region in Iraq . his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations . &quot;
in this documentation of E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey we follow Mus@@ a explaining his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his community .
&quot; I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child , &quot; &quot; explains Mus@@ a . &quot;
&quot; scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war , the construction of dam@@ s , pollution and un@@ controlled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ a is a member of the non @-@ governmental organization Wat@@ erk@@ ee@@ pers Iraq - a subsidiary of Wat@@ erk@@ e@@ eper Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers , streams and water@@ ways in Iraq , as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the video , Mus@@ a sums up the ur@@ gency and importance of his work in a matter : &quot; if we had no water , how would we survive ? &quot;
&quot; this video was produced , filmed and published for En@@ sia by E@@ mil@@ y Kin@@ sk@@ ey , one in Er@@ bil , Iraq @-@ based documentary film@@ maker and multimedia journalist . &quot;
&quot; the main focus of her work lies on persecuted , poorly observed sub@@ cultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative vide@@ ography and new multimedia techniques , whose help supp@@ ressed communities can tell their stories in their own way . &quot;

the following article is the shortened and edited version of the article &quot; The Wave of Viol@@ ence against Women in Paraguay &quot; by cur@@ es . the article belongs to the series # Por@@ ser@@ Mu@@ j@@ er ( # nun @-@ ef@@ actors ) reported on the violence wave over women in Paraguay .
most names have been changed to protect the affected persons .
&quot; a police commission@@ er told A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez that she could do nothing against Luis Bal@@ bu@@ ena , her ex @-@ partner , who had become violent against her . &quot;
&quot; since the end of her relationship a little time has gone and the police said that her statement would be placed on the acts , but more could not be done . &quot;
&quot; when another woman showed Bal@@ bu@@ ena about abuse , the apparent ad of A@@ da B@@ Ã¡@@ ez also used nothing . &quot;
&quot; a few days later , the second woman with@@ drew her advertisement . &quot;
breaking the vi@@ cious circle of violence against women is difficult .
&quot; if women ever report an ad at all , they generally do not receive support from the State . &quot;
&quot; in many cases , women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse . this also explains why only 20 % of all women who admit to be victims of violence are at all reporting to the law enforcement authorities . &quot;
&quot; contents 1 Beat and Statisti@@ cal 2 In@@ visible abuse and a judicial system , which is nothing sub@@ divided of Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , poor implementation of pun@@ ches and statistics &quot;
&quot; it is hard to determine how many women are really mi@@ stre@@ ated , says My@@ rian Gon@@ z@@ Ã¡@@ lez , researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Docum@@ ent@@ aciÃ³n y E@@ studios , a social scientific research institution in Paraguay . &quot;
&quot; however , the available figures are alar@@ ming . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the District At@@ tor@@ ney General opened 9@@ 600 advertisements for domestic violence . at 70 % of it was violence against women . &quot;
86 % of the ads at the police came from women .
there were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the courts of peace . 86 % of women &apos;s ads came here as well .
&quot; in the advertisements , 40 % of women said they were physically ab@@ used , 55 % of women spoke of mental abuse . &quot;
but these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay .
&quot; according to the Paragu@@ ay@@ an women &apos;s minister Ana Bai@@ ar@@ di , only a few of these crimes are actually shown . &quot; &quot; to every woman in Paraguay for psychological abuse notification , 9 women who do not do so . &quot;
&quot; on every woman who is ref@@ unded because of physical abuse , two women who do not do this , &quot; &quot; she stated at the end of 2014 . &quot;
&quot; since the murder of women in Paraguay is not an individual criminal record , the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners . &quot;
&quot; by August 2016 alone , journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women &apos;s murder in the country . &quot;
the coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners .
&quot; according to their estimates , in Paraguay , every ten days a woman dies because of violence through men . &quot;

&quot; invisible mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment and a judicial system , which does not under@@ mine &quot;
&quot; before Mari@@ ana Br@@ Ã­@@ te@@ z became the firm friend of Carlos Vera , he insi@@ sted that she named him the names of all her former friends . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , she didn &apos;t want to do that , but after that she was supposed to regret it . &quot;
&quot; today Mari@@ ana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos , but for two years she endu@@ red psych@@ ic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise : &quot;
I never thought I would become a victim of abuse .
&quot; when I read about it earlier , I always thought that it just happened to women who are too sub@@ mis@@ sive because they are deceived by violent men . &quot;
I was convinced that this would never happen to me .
Mari@@ ana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera .
&quot; without nam@@ ing names , she wrote articles on Facebook , describing his insul@@ ts and various attacks during her two @-@ year relationship and told how he had isolated her . &quot;
&quot; many people responded to their posts , including Carlos himself . he asked rhet@@ or@@ ical whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse . &quot;
&quot; other Facebook users asked Mari@@ ana , why she had liked the so long of Carlos and did not leave it earlier . &quot;
it seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complic@@ ity in it .
&quot; Victoria San@@ tos , which is not from Paraguay , fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mi@@ stre@@ ated . &quot;
Victoria is a member of the network Y@@ o te Cre@@ o ( &quot; I believe you &quot; ) consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in any way .
&quot; in the group , they can talk to others about their experiences , listen to each other and support each other . &quot;
they do what many others do not do : they take the statements of women seriously .
in Victoria &apos;s case everything started with psych@@ ic abuse .
her aff@@ lu@@ ent partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worth@@ less .
then he began beating them .
&quot; Victoria &apos;s advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives , they did not receive any support . &quot;
&quot; she led a process against her former partner , who developed into an imper@@ me@@ able legal battle between Paraguay and her home country , in which it was mainly about money , power and the influence of her former partner . &quot;
&quot; Paraguay &apos;s laws : good approach , poor implementation &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good , but not applied . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the announcement of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judi@@ ci@@ ary , &quot; &quot; says Victoria San@@ tos . &quot;
&quot; Carmen Ech@@ au@@ ri , a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay , also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country . &quot;
&quot; on 10 August 2016 , a bill was discussed in the Paragu@@ ay@@ an Parliament , known under the h@@ ash@@ tag # Por@@ Ell@@ as ( # for Her ) . &quot;
this h@@ ash@@ tag and the Movement # Ni@@ Un@@ a@@ Men@@ os ( # Non@@ on@@ ess ) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Am@@ nesty International .
the original draft of the law fores@@ ees fem@@ ici@@ des to declare and punish fem@@ ici@@ des as it is already the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia .
&quot; thus , the wording of the law was altered in some respects , in order to also gain the de@@ pu@@ ties of the law that feared that the way for de@@ crimin@@ alisation of abor@@ tions was denied , which are generally forbidden in Paraguay and to be punished with up to five years in prison . &quot;
&quot; the original bill envis@@ aged the majority of the ( bureaucratic and economic ) proced@@ ural costs that the victims of violence currently have to bear , if they just re@@ pay and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state . &quot;
&quot; Ech@@ au@@ ri ar@@ gues that the law is not effective , if the legislature does not provide sufficient funds for it : &quot;
&quot; in Paraguay , abuse is seen as part of inter@@ personal relationships . &quot;
&quot; here , a re@@ thinking must take place so that violence is no longer seen as something normal . &quot;
&quot; who is silent in the face of these facts , makes himself guilty and helps to get away from the offen@@ ders . &quot;
we have to refund until mi@@ stre@@ at@@ ment is no longer considered normal .
&quot; on 10 November 2016 , the Law of the Par@@ agu@@ ay@@ an Senate was passed . however , parts of the law had been amended . &quot;
the opinions about the changes go apart .
the section on reconciliation was seen as an opportunity for the aggres@@ sor to attack his victim again .
&quot; the cancellation of the words &quot; gender , &quot; &quot; political force &quot; and &quot; sexual har@@ ass@@ ment &quot; of parts of the law , however , is considered to be a great set@@ back . &quot;

independent media continues to face attacks in Oman a year after a newspaper ban
&quot; &quot; &quot; this website was closed due to a resolution of the Minister of Information &quot; &quot; is to be read on the homepage of the banned newspaper Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; more than a year ago , the om@@ anic authorities have closed the independent Arab @-@ language newspaper Az@@ am@@ n because of their reporting on corruption in the sul@@ t@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , one of the editors of the newspaper , is still in prison , where he served as a prison sentence . &quot;
&quot; two other editors of Az@@ am@@ n , I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i were also arrested and brought to court , but later released again . &quot;
&quot; Oman has been ruled by Sultan Q@@ ab@@ us i@@ bn S@@ aid since 1970 , who came to power following his father , S@@ aid i@@ bn Ta@@ im@@ ur , by a coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at . &quot;
&quot; in addition to his role as the only sul@@ tan , he has held the most important positions in the country : Prime Minister , Minister of Defence , supreme commander of the Ar@@ med Forces , Minister of Finance , Foreign Minister , President of the Supreme Council for Planning and President of the Central Bank . &quot;
&quot; the Sultan &apos;s rule is marked by the persistent efforts of the security forces , in particular the secret services of domestic civil liber@@ ties , including press freedom , and to torture and in@@ timi@@ date independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers and other activists . &quot;
&quot; the authorities systematically restrict peaceful and legitimate activities in the field of human rights and prevent citizens , including activists , to freely express their views on the country &apos;s public affairs , such as corruption in authorities and institutions both online and offline . &quot;
&quot; the attack on Az@@ am@@ n &apos;s newspaper , its closure and detention of three of its editors last year is a hard blow to press freedom in the country . &quot;
Az@@ am@@ n is an independent newspaper that has been reported since its foundation in 2007 about corruption in Oman ( an absolute monarchy ) until it was banned by the authorities in August 2016 .
&quot; on 28 July 2016 , security forces I@@ bra@@ him Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Chief Editor of Az@@ am@@ n , arrested an article published in the newspaper on July 26 , 2016 with the title &quot; High @-@ ranking parties bind the hands of the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the report , government officials were accused of having put judges of the Supreme Court in Oman to susp@@ end a ruling in an inheritance dispute . &quot;

&quot; on 3 August 2016 , Zah@@ er Al @-@ Abr@@ i , member of the Editorial Board , was invited from the ISS to the special department and arrested by the security forces on his arrival . &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2016 , the ISS captured deputy editor @-@ in @-@ chief You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j , who acted as chief editor after Al @-@ Ma@@ amar@@ i &apos;s arrest . &quot;
&quot; the newspaper was closed in@@ definitely after the Minister of Information had given the statement that &quot; the publication and distribution of the newspaper in any way , including online , will be banned from 9 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; on 26 September 2016 , the Trial Chamber held the first trial in the trial against Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari , Al @-@ Ha@@ j and Al @-@ Abr@@ i . &quot;
the court sentenced the three journalists to prison terms and ordered the final closure of the newspaper .
&quot; al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were both convic@@ ted of &quot; &quot; public order &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; mis@@ use of the Internet &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; under@@ mining the State of the State &quot; . &quot; &quot;
al @-@ Ha@@ j was found guilty of the violation of a ban on the publication and the slan@@ der .
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari and Al @-@ Ha@@ j were sentenced to three years imprisonment and fin@@ es of 3,000 om@@ ani@@ ans each ( 7@@ 800 US dollars ) . in addition a one @-@ year ban imposed by the two journalists was imposed .
al @-@ Abr@@ i was sentenced to a year in prison and a fine of 1000 ri@@ al ( 26@@ 00 US dollars ) after he was found guilty of using &quot; an information network for the dis@@ semination of material that could pose a threat to public order . &quot;
&quot; for Al @-@ Abr@@ i , a deposit of 5000 om@@ ani@@ ans was fixed ( 13@@ ,000 US dollars ) and he was released from prison on 22 August 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the Appe@@ als Court acqu@@ itted Al @-@ Ha@@ j in a hearing on 26 December 2016 , but sentenced Al @-@ Ha@@ j to six months in prison for one year and Al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari . &quot;
al @-@ Ma@@ am@@ ari was released on 10 April 2017 after his six months prison sentence from the central prison in Mas@@ kat . al @-@ Ha@@ j is still in prison where he served his annual prison sentence .
the Appe@@ als Court also suspended the decision of the Ministry of Information to close the newspaper &quot; Az@@ am@@ n . &quot;
&quot; in spite of the decision of the Court to allow Az@@ am@@ n to resume , the newspaper continues to face attacks from the Korean government . &quot;
&quot; on 8 January , the Minister of Information issued an order with which the closure of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three months . &quot;
&quot; on 8 May 2017 , the Minister of Information personally signed another order in which the closing of &quot; Az@@ am@@ n &quot; was extended by three additional months and with which the minister once again opposed the decision of the Court of Appe@@ al to re@@ equip the publication of the newspaper . &quot;
the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the attacks on journalists of the newspaper are not the only cases in which the press freedom has been viol@@ ated in Oman recently .
&quot; other injuries include the closure of the website of the independent magazine M@@ ow@@ s@@ atin and the exercise of pressure on Al@@ bal@@ ad , the first independent online newspaper of the country to cease its operation . &quot;
&quot; due to the ongoing closure of Az@@ am@@ n and the detention of the journalist Al @-@ Ha@@ j , the impression that the om@@ anic authorities are still not ready to put an end to the extensive infringement of freedom of the press . &quot;
the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( G@@ CH@@ R ) ur@@ ges the Korean authorities to :
1 . release You@@ se@@ f Al @-@ Ha@@ j immediately and un@@ condition@@ ally ;
&quot; 2. to create a safe environment for the newspaper Az@@ am@@ n , so that their journalists can pursue their work ; &quot;
3 . to protect the freedom of the press in the country and
&quot; 4 . in all circumstances , to ensure that human rights def@@ enders and journalists can exercise their right human rights work un@@ imp@@ eded and without fear of ret@@ ali@@ ation , including judicial sp@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; the Gulf Centre for Human Rights ( Gulf Center for Human Rights , G@@ CH@@ R ) is an independent , non @-@ profit and non @-@ governmental organization that supports human rights def@@ enders ( also independent journalists , blo@@ g@@ gers , lawyers , etc . ) in the Gulf region and in neighbouring states through the promotion of freedom of expression and freedom of association and the right to peac@@ efully gather , support and provide protection . &quot;

medical research in Africa : opportunities and mis@@ understand@@ ings
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier 2016 in Zambia , illustration is made with his consent &quot;
&quot; medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media , but it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent . &quot;
&quot; there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site : on the one hand , there are many medicines and vacc@@ ines that cover the special medical need on the African continent . &quot;
&quot; diseases such as AIDS , tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis and mal@@ aria have a far more serious impact in the poor@@ est countries of Africa than elsewhere , and lack of investment for resear@@ ching these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a big problem . &quot;
&quot; second , research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up own research capacities in Africa . a greater role in science and technology can only be condu@@ ci@@ ve to the economic growth of the continent . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier is Director of Central Laboratory at the Center for Research on Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia ( Centre for Inf@@ ectious Disease Research in Zambia , C@@ ID@@ R@@ Z ) . &quot;
&quot; in the 1990s , he grew up in Lus@@ aka , Zambia , where the AIDS epide@@ mic first had serious effects on national health . &quot;
&quot; he left Zambia for a study in the United States , first in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , later in Indi@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; as a post doc at the University of Pennsylvania , he himself investigated the HIV virus before he decided to go back home to support the Serbian health system . &quot;
&quot; with Global Vo@@ ices , Dr. War@@ rier discussed the future of medical research in Zambia and about mis@@ understand@@ ings of the media about this research . &quot;
( discla@@ imer : Dr. War@@ rier speaks as a private person ) .
global Vo@@ ices ( GM ) : what is your research topic ?
&quot; Ran@@ j@@ it War@@ rier RW : at the moment , the focus of my work is on the application of research results . I support the sam@@ ba national program for anti@@ retro@@ viral therapy ( ART ) with laboratory tests . &quot;
&quot; in addition , I am currently studying a research program for the development of molecular diagnostic tests for HIV , TB and other relevant patho@@ gens . &quot;
GM : what are the key current scientific topics in your country and in Africa in your opinion ?
how do they differ from those in Western countries ?
RW : there is no basic research here . we only use solutions that have been developed elsewhere .
&quot; this must change , otherwise we will always remain recipients instead of being a maker . &quot;
&quot; the solutions we get are often not suitable in our environment , and sometimes it is even impossible to use them here . &quot;
GM : where does the funding and support come from ?
is it sufficient ?
how easy or difficult is it to find suitable scientists for the projects ?
RW : from the USA and Europe .
the projects are supported in different ways .
&quot; it is difficult to find people who want to come back or go here , because financing and development chances are better in other countries . &quot;
GM : how is the research infrastructure ?
what obstacles are there in your routine research work you did not have before ?
&quot; RW : the basic infrastructure does not meet the standards in developed countries . it costs a lot of money to have a continuous supply of electricity , water and internet . &quot;
&quot; laboratory equipment is expensive , and it takes months to import it from other countries . &quot;
GM : what is the opinion of the public about science and scientists in Africa ?
&quot; RW : there is interest , but only a very limited understanding of scientific methods . &quot;
I would suggest that critical thinking and scientific methods should be taught in schools to improve the situation .
&quot; GM : how big is your opinion about the potential of scientific research in Africa , what should it concentrate on and how can we support development ? &quot;
RW : the potential is amazing .
I have seen great students of all ages .
&quot; there is need for special academic education , starting at any age . &quot;
&quot; social sciences , computer science , big data , study of space , healthcare ( non @-@ communic@@ able and communic@@ able diseases ) and the efficiency of traditional medicine will benefit greatly from this . &quot;
&quot; GM : can you describe the advantages and disadvantages of life as a scientist in Africa against Western countries , based on your experience ? &quot;
&quot; RW : it is often the limited speed to do things , and the difficult access to scientific expertise that presents challenges here . &quot;
&quot; the system that magazines can only make articles available against payment ( the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; pay@@ wall &quot; &quot; ) , also limits the amount of available information and the speed of research . &quot;
from the USA to India : how &quot; open source &quot; seed producers change global food production
&quot; Rachel C@@ ern@@ an@@ sky &apos;s contribution was originally published on the website En@@ si@@ a.com , a magazine reported on solutions for environmental issues around the world . &quot;
Frank Mort@@ on has been breeding salads in the USA since the 1980s .
&quot; its company offers 114 varieties , such as Out@@ red@@ ressing , the first plant grown and consumed by NASA a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts in space . &quot;
&quot; for almost 20 years , Mort@@ on &apos;s work was limited only by its own in@@ genu@@ ity and the question of how many salads he can get . &quot;
but at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding .
&quot; the patents are not only for individual varieties , but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases , a special red or green tone or cri@@ mp@@ ed leaves . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cer@@ eal or car@@ rot varieties . due to this trend , plant breeders , environ@@ ment@@ alists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production . &quot;
&quot; as a passionate representative of a mill@@ en@@ nia @-@ old tradition , Mort@@ on still breeds let@@ tu@@ ce , but now it needs longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions . &quot;
it is as if in a river a b@@ oul@@ der is lying around which I have to yo@@ del .
&quot; so we have to do it now , but it &apos;s a break with the breeding tradition , &quot; he says . &quot; I think these patents go far too far on salads . &quot;
&quot; and if they stand before judgment , no one can breed a new salad type because all features have already been patented . &quot;
&quot; however , it is very cau@@ tious and endeav@@ ours to not use material that is protected as intellectual property . &quot;
he also joined a movement that is growing ever greater in the USA and everywhere in the world : open Source Bre@@ eding ( &quot; Open Source &quot; breeding ) .
&quot; a@@ stron@@ au@@ ts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman let@@ tu@@ ce of the variety &quot; &quot; greenhouse &quot; &quot; of the station . there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space . &quot;

it is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding .
&quot; the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative ( initiative for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed ) is inspired by the movement for free &quot; open source &quot; software , which provides alternatives to copy@@ righ@@ ted software . &quot;
it has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders .
&quot; as part of the initiative , known as Os@@ si , US breeders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds bred by them . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that they will not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it . &quot; open Source &quot; breeders are merely allowing others who buy seeds to breed their own varieties , and not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents . &quot;
dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014 .
glo@@ omy outlook
&quot; for the professor at the University of Wis@@ con@@ sin @-@ Ma@@ dison and Os@@ si Board member Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg , control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection . &quot;
&quot; therefore seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity , farmers &apos; rights , control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture . independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance . &quot;
Klo@@ pp@@ enburg stresses that the &quot; open source &quot; movement does not concern genetically modified plants .
&quot; all types of plants could be patented , whether vegetables , grain , genetically modified or not , from ecological agriculture or not . &quot; to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability , we need control over the seed , &quot; he says , and takes on the increasingly common mer@@ gers in the global agricultural industry , as is the case for example in farmers markets , should also know that the way this vegetables are bred is threatened . &quot;
food sovereignty without sovereignty is not possible . &quot;
&quot; the members of the Open Source Se@@ ed Initiative are committed to remaining freely available to others , in contrast to seed and plant characteristics . &quot;
photo by Jack Klo@@ pp@@ enburg .
&quot; Os@@ si supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk , as the available gene pool is constantly shr@@ inking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material that is therefore always restricted . &quot;
&quot; Cla@@ ire Lu@@ by , executive director of Os@@ si , has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in car@@ rots and their availability . she found out that around a third of all car@@ rot characteristics are protected as intellectual property , making it difficult for plant breeders to use either at all . &quot;
&quot; there are still no such estimates for other plants yet , but experts such as Lu@@ by assume that mass cultivated plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than let@@ tu@@ ce or car@@ rots . &quot;
a question of view
&quot; plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from such , through which their taste or colour is improved to such , because of which they thri@@ ve in certain environments and withstand threats such as p@@ ests or diseases . &quot;
&quot; opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents . at present , genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions by climate change are far less predictable . &quot;
&quot; in an e @-@ mail , Mon@@ san@@ to @-@ Spe@@ aker C@@ arly Sc@@ ad@@ u@@ to acknow@@ le@@ dges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Mon@@ san@@ to &apos;s activities . with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States , the company is committed to the conservation of genetic diversity . &quot;
&quot; however , it contradic@@ ts the view that intellectual property is owned by other breeders , as patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation . &quot; &quot; a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expi@@ red . &quot;
often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method .
&quot; such protection does not inhi@@ bit innovation , but encourages them by providing the public with more material and know @-@ how . &quot;
&quot; Mort@@ on sees this differently : 20 years of waiting until a patent exp@@ ires , certainly not promoting innovations . &quot;
&quot; and if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changing environmental conditions , you should have lost the fight . &quot;
&quot; however , the main argument for Mort@@ on is that genetic resources have always been common good and should continue to remain : &quot; independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such form@@ alities , and monetary incentives are not attractive to us . &quot;
we want farmers to make their work easier .
&quot; this is what drives us , and it becomes impossible for us to continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources . &quot;
&quot; overall , Mort@@ on is interfer@@ ing with the concept of pat@@ enting plant @-@ characteristics : &quot; we do not really create the characteristics themselves . &quot;
the plants themselves form them and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that .
a secret of nature . &quot;
&quot; for C@@ aro@@ l Dep@@ pe , plant bree@@ der in Oreg@@ on and Os@@ si board member , there is another important aspect of plant breeding : &quot; those who breed a variety also breed their own values into it . &quot;
&quot; those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and mono@@ cultures , for their cultivation , are required to produce a mass of her@@ bi@@ cides , which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture . &quot;
my concept is exactly opposite . &quot;
&quot; while some medium @-@ sized enterprises ( such that move on international markets , but smaller than Mon@@ san@@ to ) possess patents , they manage most of the smaller seed companies , even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not re@@ warding or both is the case . &quot;
the independent plant bree@@ der Frank Mort@@ on looks for Sal@@ ate in his breeding garden .

&quot; in addition , Mort@@ on believes that through avoiding plant patents , breeders would be more innovative : &quot; it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new , stronger than companies that patent . &quot;
&quot; I constantly need new material for my catalogue , as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years , &quot; he says . &quot; with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competition , with which I think it is quite easy . &quot; worldwide resonance &quot;
&quot; although the US seems to be leading in the open source breeding , the concept is now spreading rapidly all over the world . &quot;
&quot; in India , the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture introduces itself as a professional organization in the field of resources , an &quot; open source &quot; seed programme . for the preservation of the seeds of traditional crops , the centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements . &quot;
it also supports them to come to &quot; Open Source &quot; seeds and sell their own .
&quot; the German Organisation Agre@@ col works on an &quot; open @-@ source &quot; licence , which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Os@@ si commitment to breeders in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; ( provisions for breeding differ from country to country , so the Os@@ si obligation cannot simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world . ) &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of November 2016 , the executive of the European Union , the European Commission , declared that conven@@ tionally bred plants should not be pat@@ ent@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , an explanation is not a law ; now it is up to the member states &apos; governments to apply the Patent Office to implement this new line . &quot;
&quot; in October 2016 , the Dutch organization Hi@@ v@@ os organized a conference on &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers , operators of seed banks and representatives of governments , NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa gathered to learn about the &quot; open source &quot; seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the pat@@ enting of seeds . &quot;
&quot; Willy Dou@@ ma , responsible for Hi@@ v@@ os &apos; programme for &quot; Open Source &quot; seed systems , explains that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for &quot; open source &quot; seed systems , which will be the official start of the official launch next year . &quot;
&quot; an association consisting of environmental and development aid groups ( including Hi@@ v@@ os , the international non @-@ profit @-@ development organisation US@@ C Canada and the action group on erosion , technology and concentration ) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Se@@ ed Map Project , a seed map . &quot;
&quot; in September , the Global Alliance for the Future of Food , the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report from relief organisations such as the W@@ K Kel@@ log@@ g Foundation , the Mc@@ Knight Foundation and others . &quot;
&quot; the report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context , from the Lu@@ by of Os@@ si hopes that more people will soon recognize it . &quot;
&quot; the movement for regional and ecological food has , above all , taken care of where and how something is cultivated , and seed systems have hardly played a role here , &quot; said Lu@@ by . &quot; we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their food . &quot;

human Rights Organisation and Blog are the latest targets of cens@@ orship in Egypt
the Egyptian authorities still block content on the Internet .
this time it was the website of a human rights organisation and blog of a colum@@ n@@ ist .
&quot; on the weekend of 05.@@ August , the Egyptian government blocked the website of the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information ( AN@@ H@@ RI ) , which documents human rights violations in Egypt and the Arab world and reported above . &quot;
&quot; in August , the Network posted an opinion on Facebook in which the Egyptian authorities critic@@ ised this step and promised to continue the work and efforts for human rights in the region . &quot;
&quot; the Arabic Network for Human Rights Information remains committed to defending the freedom of expression and human rights in the Arab world , despite this attack and the cul@@ pr@@ its of Egyptian law and the constitution , so it has never been as important as it is now . AN@@ H@@ RI affir@@ ms that all technical possibilities are exhausted in order to overcome the block@@ ade and not to give up . we insist on fulfilling our task . &quot;
&quot; AN@@ H@@ RI is considered to be the first cens@@ ored website of a human rights organisation in Egypt , after the authorities blocked 21 websites more than two months ago , such as the independent news page M@@ ada Mas@@ r , Arabic @-@ speaking edition of the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post and Qatar @-@ based Al Jaz@@ e@@ era network . &quot;
# Egypt : 1 . human rights organisation of the wave of site closures to victims . @ an@@ hr@@ i one of the main sources of human rights in Arabic language ht@@ t@@ ps : / / t.@@ co / NI@@ Z@@ m@@ op@@ DS@@ 5@@ K
&quot; besides AN@@ H@@ RI , there is no access to Egypt on the blog of the colum@@ n@@ ist and human rights researcher Ahmed Gam@@ al Zi@@ ada . &quot;
Zi@@ ada took advantage of his blog for the dis@@ semination of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media .
&quot; now the blog that he set up to circum@@ vent the cens@@ orship of the Egyptian government , even the aim of an attack . &quot;
&quot; blo@@ gger , the provider of which also Zi@@ adas blog is given a home , on the other hand , is further accessible . &quot;
&quot; Zi@@ ada , a former photo@@ journalist , spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013 , while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police performed physical violence against two students . &quot;
his articles revol@@ ve primarily around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt .
&quot; in a Facebook comment , Zi@@ ada commented on the government and reflected what it means to him : &quot;
&quot; blocking blogs is very old , but has priority in the era of Ab@@ del@@ fat@@ tah al @-@ S@@ isi ; and even if the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world , it is for me for two reasons : &quot;
&quot; I have managed to convey a state of siege to me ; arrest , attempted murder , sum@@ mons from the National Security Council , blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked . &quot;
&quot; 2 ) You have proved that I did not write in vain . in other words , my words have influence , even though only a small audience . &quot;
I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me .
&quot; first , I used it to post articles to circum@@ vent cens@@ orship . &quot;
&quot; but now , after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words , I can still change the link or create a second blog . &quot;
the brave people go the way to the end .
&quot; according to the Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( af@@ te ) Association for Freedom of Th@@ ought and Ex@@ pression ( af@@ te ) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August . this gave technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Provi@@ ders ( ISP ) , among others Orange , Vo@@ da@@ f@@ one and E@@ ti@@ sal@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there was also documented the blocking of providers , possible through the circum@@ vention of Internet cens@@ orship and private surfing , so @-@ called Virtual Private Networks ( V@@ P@@ N@@ s ) &quot;
she reported in her research :
&quot; on Monday , June 12 , we noticed how the blocking of websites offering V@@ P@@ N@@ s began . &quot;
this kind of practice points to the government &apos;s intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users might have access .
&quot; the situation is additionally exac@@ erb@@ ated by the fact that the cens@@ orship decisions are made behind closed doors , whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed against these actions . &quot;
now the question arises : how far is the Egyptian government willing to go with cens@@ orship and who will attack them next ?
is Rio de Janeiro in war ?
the inhabitants argue .
&quot; the Brazilian army is in use in the F@@ av@@ el@@ as in Nit@@ er@@ Ã³@@ i , a city in Rio de Janeiro , during the governmental crisis . &quot;

&quot; day by day newspapers report in Brazil with more dark head@@ lines from Rio de Janeiro , the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs . &quot;
some of these head@@ lines are as follows :
&quot; 14 @-@ year @-@ old shot at school , &quot; &quot; Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered , &quot; &quot; Di@@ ebe smo@@ kes dispens@@ ary with military weapons , &quot; &quot; President Tem@@ er sends 8@@ 500 soldiers of the army , nav@@ y and air@@ waves to Rio . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the economic crisis and in a ten@@ se financial situation , the wave of violence in Rio in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years . &quot;
the Brazilian non @-@ governmental organisation Global Justice called even the United Nations to intervene .
reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable and # 8@@ 2@@ 12 ; at least find the managers of a local newspaper .
&quot; in this way , the newspaper &quot; Extra &quot; published in Rio for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio published the editorial &quot; This is not normal &quot; in which it announced a new category called &quot; War in Rio . &quot; &quot;
all reports on violence in the city are now published there .
the newspaper explained the motives for their decision :
&quot; it will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder , rob@@ ber@@ y , sex crime etc . everything , however , differs from the civili@@ zed standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the category &quot; War in Rio . &quot; ( ... ) This is our way of calling : this is not normal ! &quot;
this is the only alternative so that we as journalists don &apos;t close our eyes to cru@@ el@@ ty .
&quot; in a four minute video shared on Facebook , Oc@@ t@@ Ã¡@@ vio Gu@@ e@@ des , editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the newspaper , said that this decision was not a cause for pride , but rather a sign of failure : &quot;
it is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war ru@@ bri@@ k in a country that does not recognize the war .
&quot; the same video explains a journalist from the newspaper that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro , there are 8@@ 43 areas controlled by criminal organisations . &quot;
&quot; in the editorial , the newspaper continues to write : &quot;
&quot; we are aware that a war discourse , when it is distorted , can also be used to disgu@@ ise the atro@@ cities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions . &quot;
&quot; but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police , whose aim is not the civilian population , but the economic power of the Ma@@ fia and its partners . &quot;
does the term &quot; war &quot; harm more than it benefits ?
&quot; in an article on the news portal The Inter@@ c@@ ept Bra@@ sil , journalist Cec@@ Ã­@@ lia Oli@@ v@@ eira ar@@ gues that violence as a &quot; war &quot; is argu@@ ing . &quot;
this is not a war .
&quot; this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel , education and a historical and compl@@ ac@@ ent neglect of the public sector . &quot;
&quot; as a reminder , the state of Rio de Janeiro is greater than its capital . &quot;

&quot; according to the statistics of 2015 , Rio de Janeiro declared &quot; the most violent place in Brazil , &quot; according to statistics from 2015 in the north and northeast of the country . these are the most up @-@ to @-@ date available data . &quot;
none of these cities are located in Rio de Janeiro .

&quot; the founding of the U@@ PP ( Uni@@ da@@ de de Pol@@ Ã­@@ cia P@@ aci@@ fic@@ ad@@ ora ) , a police unit set up by the state of Rio in 2003 , was to capture a fav@@ ela by deplo@@ ying a massive police operation and permanently station@@ ing a unit there . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning , this actually led to a decrease of forci@@ ble deaths . however , after several years , the U@@ PP was increasingly under bombar@@ d@@ ment after several reports of ch@@ ic@@ ans and repres@@ sions against the poor communities , which should actually protect the newly created police unit . &quot;
&quot; on his Facebook page , the journalist Jo@@ Ã£o Paulo Char@@ le@@ aux quoted from one of his articles in 2010 , explaining why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria for the term &quot; civil war &quot; by the Geneva Convention . &quot;
he writes :
&quot; in addition to legal issues , the classification of the situation in Rio as war also involves serious consequences for the people . &quot;
&quot; this requires the state to use means and methods that are typical of a war . this includes penetration into the territory of a &quot; enemy , &quot; in which civil society is an un@@ sharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of &quot; col@@ lateral damage &quot; and &quot; lost bul@@ lets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; war back or forth , the fact is that the inhabitants of F@@ av@@ el@@ as continue to suffer in Rio . &quot;
one week it is now that the police cleared the mountain with the F@@ av@@ ela Jac@@ are@@ zin@@ ho to av@@ enge the death of a polic@@ eman .
&quot; in the midst of all this violence , this incident too made head@@ lines : a fruit vendor died as a result of gun@@ shots fired by the police from a helicopter . &quot;

source : Can@@ Do@@ action
&quot; since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war , many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and block@@ ades , mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops . &quot;
&quot; according to victories Watch , a joint initiative of the peace organization PA@@ X and the research institute The Syria Institute , there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding land , H@@ oms , Dei@@ r E@@ zz@@ or and I@@ d@@ li@@ b . &quot;
&quot; the region of East Gh@@ out@@ a is particularly heavily affected , where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians . &quot;
&quot; many governments , international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed . &quot;
&quot; since 2013 , these rebels controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege , leading to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally produced or smu@@ g@@ gled food through tunnels and control points . &quot;
&quot; due to the years of block@@ ade , traditional foods such as meat have become un@@ at@@ tain@@ able for large parts of the population . &quot;
&quot; as a counter @-@ measure , a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academ@@ ics will teach the inhabitants of East Gh@@ out@@ as , how they can plant their own mushrooms as a &quot; life @-@ saving food source . &quot; &quot;
they call themselves G@@ hi@@ ra Al@@ nah@@ da and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Ad@@ ala .
mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods cultivated in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian kitchen . however their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieg@@ ed East Gh@@ out@@ a .
&quot; the project , Ab@@ o Nab@@ il , said to the French news agency AF@@ P : &quot;
&quot; we decided to cultivate mushrooms , because they have a high nutritional value , similar to meat , and because they can plant them in houses and cellars . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Ahmed Lei@@ la , one of the organizers , reports Global Vo@@ ices that for three years it has been fighting to announce this project and expressed his relief that it now wins more and more . &quot;
&quot; to raise money for the initiative , in consultation with the NGO G@@ hi@@ ras Al@@ nah@@ da , the humanitarian crow@@ d@@ funding platform Can@@ Do can be used . &quot;
&quot; it is planned to convey 125 families of knowledge about planting mushrooms , so Dr. Lei@@ la becomes Global Vo@@ ices . &quot;
&quot; at the time of the constitution of this article , they have reached over 100 % of their expected target of around 12,@@ 700 â¬ , but will continue to collect donations to Can@@ Do until Monday , 4 September 2017 . &quot;
the initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 Â° C and humidity at 80 % .
&quot; because of the fuel shortage , locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy . &quot;
&quot; Dr. Lei@@ la said to Global Vo@@ ices that they began with the &quot; &quot; production of mushrooms from regions &quot; &quot; before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption . &quot;
&quot; then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub . when this succeeded , they used a larger tub . and so on . &quot;
now they have created a &quot; educational farm for the region . &quot;
since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Gh@@ out@@ a free of charge .
Dr. Lei@@ la explained that it is part of a larger movement .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to teach the people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons &quot; &quot; : breach of the siege . &quot;
providing a new food source on the market .
&quot; spread a culture of self @-@ suffici@@ ency , by using food residue ( such as paper , tea , coffee , cardboard , etc ) for the extraction of new foods . &quot;
&quot; creation of new jobs , especially for women working at home . &quot;
creating new jobs for people with disabilities who are tied to their home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; We hope to spread this idea all over the world so that our success as well as our fight against hunger and the siege will become visible . &quot;
we want our experiences to inspire people in crisis areas and we can help humanity .

Portuguese demand justice for the victims of 2017 &quot; fires
&quot; on 21 October , several hundred people prot@@ ested in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were ramp@@ ant in the north of Portugal . &quot;
forty @-@ two persons died and some 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October . this led to the government last week calling for solidarity with the victims for 3 days .
&quot; fires have also been registered in the Gali@@ cia region , where there were 4 dead . &quot;
&quot; it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire out@@ breaks , spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages . &quot;
&quot; in June , a similar tragedy happened in Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o Grande , where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured . &quot;
&quot; according to the European forest monitoring system , which monitors the forest areas by satellite ima@@ gery , around 500,000 acres of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district . &quot;
so that you can make a better picture of the seri@@ ousness of the situation : there is no fire in 4 districts .
&quot; all of Portugal burns in the tru@@ est sense of the word # Pra@@ y@@ For@@ Portugal - nat@@ a &quot; ( @ a _ at@@ aner ) October 15 , 2017 &quot;

numerous videos spread on the web and show images that allow better insights into what is happening :
the fores@@ eeable tragedy
the objective of the protests of Saturday was the demand for better prevention and fire fighting measures by the state .
people wondered why civil protection was unable to cur@@ b the scale of tragedy as far as possible
Jo@@ Ã£o Sover@@ al of the Bund der Far@@ mers of Portugal declared the paper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o :
&quot; after Ped@@ r@@ Ã³@@ g@@ Ã£o , roads and villages were evacu@@ ated for everything and nothing . &quot;
this Sunday they did not do this anywhere : there are dozens of reports of open roads surrounded by fire .
&quot; a similar tragedy might have happened in the forest of Lei@@ ria , as in June , as the streets were closed very late . &quot;
&quot; in addition , building permits in locations with high fire risk are questioned . &quot;
&quot; a far @-@ reaching proposal on the reform of the forest , which the government had brought in after serious fires in 2003 and 2005 , was obj@@ ected by the local authorities , who saw the new rules as an obstacle to investments . &quot;
&quot; the government introduced a loos@@ ening of the law , which allowed the construction activity case if the applicant had funds for self @-@ defence - that was an open backdoor so that everything could be built , &quot; adds Jo@@ Ã£o Sor@@ val in the same article of the newspaper P@@ Ãº@@ b@@ lic@@ o . &quot;
&quot; the environmental organization Qu@@ erc@@ us pointed out that large areas with eu@@ calyp@@ tus , trees made of easily combus@@ tible wood , spread like in a vi@@ cious circle , after fires of this kind . &quot;
&quot; to these problems , the website of the Civil Defence of Portugal on October 15 and 16 , when people sought information or tried to contact relatives , offline . &quot;
&quot; it was a private initiative that provided information to the population , using the application fo@@ gos@@ .@@ pt and informed the population in real time about the location and spread of fires . &quot;
&quot; the project was launched in 2015 by the developer Jo@@ Ã£o P@@ ina in order to simplify the work of the fire bri@@ g@@ ade and , on this fat@@ eful weekend in October , was so crucial that the servers did not withstand the ons@@ lau@@ ght of the 400@@ ,000 users who followed the fires : the website counted over half a million hits . &quot;
even the founder asked for help :

the path from the refugee from Afghanistan to a successful entrepreneur

&quot; during one night in autumn 1994 , the conquest of Afghanistan began by the Taliban . &quot;
&quot; two years earlier , a terrible civil war broke out between the various Mu@@ j@@ ah@@ edi@@ n groups who had defeated the short @-@ lived pro @-@ Soviet government . thus Afghanistan became a country of terror and despair . &quot;
&quot; at that time , A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ ati , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who belonged to the ethnic group of Haz@@ ara , was in the province of G@@ haz@@ ni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together . &quot;
&quot; even if his mother didn &apos;t say it at that time , she knew that she would not see her son much longer - maybe even more . &quot;
&quot; in the morning , the boy was supposed to break up . &quot;
his un@@ cle would pick him up and bring him to the hau@@ lers .

&quot; Ab@@ dul Ali Maz@@ ari , leader of the He@@ z@@ b @-@ e @-@ Wah@@ dat party dominated by Haz@@ ara , had just been murdered by the Taliban and many Haz@@ ara felt un@@ protected . &quot;
&quot; the Taliban , known for their hatred for Haz@@ ara , came closer and closer . &quot;
many Haz@@ ara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran .
&quot; a few days after his escape , A@@ shar@@ af found himself in Pakistan again . &quot;
&quot; for a couple of years , he worked in a co@@ h@@ ort . the work was heavy and made him ill . &quot;
&quot; once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dra@@ gged bags with mortar , which were heavier than he himself , in order to earn his living . &quot;
&quot; back then , as today , the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by poverty and exploitation . &quot;
&quot; it was really hard , &quot; &quot; remembered A@@ shar@@ af in an interview with Global Vo@@ ices . &quot; &quot; we ( Afghan refugees ) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked . &quot;
there was no service and no heating . we hung n@@ ylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night .
&quot; after four years , A@@ shar@@ af left his life without papers in Iran and was ready to travel to Europe . &quot;
&quot; during the dangerous crossing on the sea , he suffered ship@@ w@@ reck and str@@ anded on a small , un@@ inhabited Greek island . &quot;
&quot; after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application , A@@ shar@@ af came to Italy in 2002 . &quot;
&quot; some time ago A@@ shar@@ af was homeless , running alone through the streets of Rome , slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day . &quot;
&quot; true , Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high quot@@ as . it is true , however , that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are cat@@ astrop@@ hic . &quot;
the human rights organisation Civil Liber@@ ties Union for Europe writes that the system &quot; suffers from a general lack of transparency .
&quot; the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000 &quot; &quot; special recording centres &quot; . &quot; these are impro@@ vised facilities in the hands of un@@ qualified and un@@ trained personnel . &quot;
&quot; according to the Italian law , asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can take months after the registration of the asylum application . &quot;
&quot; until then , people who do not have money for accommodation have either reli@@ ed on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street . &quot;
so there was also A@@ shar@@ af .
&quot; but his un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive life @-@ wil@@ le helped A@@ shar@@ af to liber@@ ate himself from these conditions , soon . &quot;
&quot; after several years of work in the construction industry , A@@ shar@@ af was hiding all his savings in the creation of a host@@ els in Venice . &quot;
this went so well that after a while he opened a second hostel and a fast snack .
A@@ shar@@ af Bar@@ atis Succ@@ ess Story is now subject to the documentary &quot; Beh@@ ind Venice Luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ( German : &quot; behind Venetian luxury - a Haz@@ ara in Italy &quot; ) of the director Am@@ in Wa@@ hi@@ di .
&quot; the film won the Venice City Award , which was awarded for the 24th time in 2017 . &quot;

the conditions for entrepreneurs in Italy - especially for non @-@ Itali@@ ans - are very difficult .
&quot; much bureaucracy , high taxes and conditions for loans are just a few of the obstacles . &quot;
&quot; according to un@@ official estimates , about 20,000 Afgh@@ ans live in Italy . &quot;
&quot; for many of them , the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , some of the Afgh@@ ans operated , including tailor shops , travel agencies , hotels and restaurants . &quot;
some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine .
&quot; in Venice Ham@@ ed Ah@@ ma@@ di had the idea of his Restaurant Orient Experience , where the wa@@ iters and kitchen staff were mostly refugees from different parts of the world . &quot;
&quot; the menu of the restaurant tells the story of their trip to Italy through the various Afghan , Iraqi , Turkish and Greek dishes . &quot;
the Afghan entrepreneur Ali Khan Q@@ al@@ and@@ ari opened the Peace &amp; amp ; Sp@@ ice restaurant in Pad@@ ua and also behind the pizz@@ eria Kab@@ u@@ lo@@ gn@@ a in Bologna and a sus@@ hi restaurant in Rome also have Afgh@@ ans .
&quot; however , A@@ shar@@ af@@ s aims far beyond the Italian hospitality industry and retailers and aim back to the country which he forced to leave as a teen@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; where there is a risk , there are also opportunities , &quot; says A@@ shar@@ af with a smile . &quot; I want to invest in Afghanistan . &quot;
I have never forgotten my country and I cannot live happily if I know that my people are suffering .
&quot; I plan a project for farmers from the poor@@ est provinces of the country , especially for women . &quot;
they represent half of society and have to get the same opportunities as everyone else . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af also has plans for the opening of a factory in Kab@@ ul , where people can learn packaging and preservation techniques . &quot; this is how they can sell their crop sur@@ pl@@ uses in the market and improve their financial situation , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; the development of the successful entrepreneur was a journey through uncertainty and doubt , but at the end there are stability and prosperity . &quot;
&quot; A@@ shar@@ af has made this journey himself , and now he wants to help other Afgh@@ ans on this journey . &quot;
&quot; citizen report : Egypt &apos;s draft bills enable shut@@ down of social networks Mah@@ m@@ oud Abu Z@@ aid , aka Sha@@ w@@ kan , in detention for more than 900 days . &quot;
&quot; he reported on the evacu@@ ation of the Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a el A@@ da@@ we@@ ya camp in Cairo , which prot@@ ested against the dem@@ ise of President Mohamed Mor@@ si . &quot;

the Egyptian parliament reviews a bill that fores@@ ees that users can use social media such as Twitter or Facebook only after registering with a government authority .
&quot; users would have to register to use the social networks within six months of the submission of the bill to the authority , stating their full name as well as their ID number . &quot;
those who neglect this step could be sentenced to up to six months of imprisonment or a re@@ payment of a penalty .
&quot; the law , which was applied by sixty members of Parliament , is currently facing the legislative and constitutional committee of the Parliament and shall be deb@@ ated there . &quot;
&quot; in May , another Member of Parliament filed a legislative proposal to introduce harder pun@@ ishments for the insul@@ t of the president or a high ranking officer . &quot;
&quot; under Egyptian law , the insul@@ t of the President and state institutions is already pun@@ ishable . under the legislative proposal such a deed would be punished with prison and fin@@ es , so legal experts of the Tah@@ ri@@ r Institute for Middle East Policy . &quot;
&quot; if the law is passed , this can mean up to three years in prison for the condemned . &quot;
&quot; in addition , this would under@@ line a political climate in which the right to freedom of expression and freedom of assembly has already been in danger for many years . &quot;
&quot; a striking example is the case of the Egyptian photographer Mah@@ m@@ oud Ab@@ o Z@@ ID ( known as Sha@@ w@@ kan ) who captured Egyptian polic@@ emen while demonstrating violence against demonstr@@ ators who demonstrated against the military coup , leading to the up@@ lift of the elected President Mohammed Mor@@ si . &quot;
&quot; just like more than 700 protest participants who had been arrested at the same incident , Sha@@ w@@ kan had four years in jail for a trial date . &quot;
&quot; recently , his trial was postpon@@ ed until May 20 , because the prison leadership failed to put the accused from prison to the cour@@ tro@@ om . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ w@@ kan threat@@ ens the death penalty due to one , so many human rights groups agree , fake loading of e.g. weapons possession , illegal assembly , murder and attempted murder . &quot;
&quot; in another case , a criminal court in G@@ iza released two journalists H@@ any Sal@@ ah @-@ el @-@ De@@ en and Mos@@ a@@ ad Al @-@ Bar@@ b@@ ary . they were indic@@ ted for their coverage of the pro @-@ Mor@@ si block@@ ade on Rab@@ a &apos;@@ a Al @-@ A@@ da@@ wi@@ ya Square in Cairo . &quot;
&quot; the court also reduced the pen@@ alties of the journalist Abdul@@ lah al @-@ fak@@ har@@ any , Sam@@ hi Mu@@ staf@@ a and Mohamed al @-@ Ad@@ ly , who were also arrested in the aforementioned incident , from 25 years to 5 years . &quot;
hear Tunisi@@ an activists listen to scann@@ ed documents
&quot; in May Tunisi@@ an authorities spent six hours with the interro@@ gation of Sam@@ i Ben G@@ har@@ bia , which is co @-@ founder of the independent media platform Na@@ wa@@ at and the Global Vo@@ ices Ad@@ voc@@ acy Project . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia has mainly been interro@@ gated as a boo@@ sted plan of action . according to the plan , the President of the Republic , who according to the plan explicitly supports a controversial bill , ass@@ uring business people and during the former regime by dict@@ ator Z@@ ine el @-@ Abi@@ dine Ben Ali of corruption accused of corruption . &quot;
&quot; the document published on April 21 on the website of Na@@ wa@@ at , sheds light on how the presidential plans to support the legislation look like . &quot;
&quot; Ben G@@ har@@ bia le@@ aned the nam@@ ing of its sources , stating Article 11 of the Tunisi@@ an Press Code , which re@@ ass@@ ures journalists the right to protect their sources . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , he appeared in the District Court in Tunis on May 09 as a witness in the case . &quot;
does China want to force the users of social media to present their identification ?
&quot; according to new regulations of the Information Office of the People &apos;s Republic of China , the users of social media in China need permission before they write or share news in social media . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is stated in the rules that the registration with the full real name will be required . &quot;
analysts assume that this will allow the elimination of anonymous comments to be achieved within social networks . it is still unclear how the authorities will apply these rules .
&quot; Chinese citizens have proposed in social media to enforce these regulations only sel@@ ectively , in order to protect citizen journ@@ alism and independence . &quot;
do we see ourselves in &quot; We@@ Chat &quot; ?
not in Russia !
&quot; in May , the state cens@@ orship of Russia closed the access to the latest Chinese mess@@ aging app . &quot;
&quot; according to Ros@@ kom@@ n@@ ad@@ z@@ or , We@@ Chat failed to register with the Land government as the &quot; Organis@@ er of the Information Council . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this term is part of a 2014 law , thanks to which the Russian government is carrying out a list of online services that will organize the &quot; publication of the information . &quot; the law also allows the government to take responsibility for the removal of content and to force it upon request for the suspension of user data . &quot;
&quot; these websites currently include web sites such as V@@ kontak@@ te and Od@@ no@@ clas@@ ni@@ ki ( Russia &apos;s two most popular social networks ) , the Image Board 2.@@ ch@@ .@@ h@@ k , the e @-@ mail service Mail@@ .@@ ru and dozens of other services . &quot;
Turkish court features Wiki@@ pedi@@ as
&quot; a Turkish court ordered the Wiki@@ pedi@@ as in Turkey , after Wikipedia administrators refused to delete two English @-@ speaking articles , the data that Turkey supports the jihadi@@ sts in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the Turkish Ministry of Transport , maritime affairs and communication provided that the site was blocked because it became &quot; a source of information that collabor@@ ates with groups to insti@@ gate a political de@@ fam@@ ation campaign against Turkey . &quot;
&quot; it is the first time Turkey has completely blocked the website . it is , besides , among other things , China , one of the few countries in the world where access to Wikipedia is not possible . &quot;
Britain can &apos;t stop sni@@ ff@@ ling
&quot; after this week , the UK government is in the midst of a targeted consultation with regard to increased surveillance powers that would force internet service providers to monitor communications in real time and install Backdoor programs that de@@ cryp@@ t data encryption . &quot;
&quot; the government has consul@@ ted telecommunications companies and secret services regarding the proposal , but has left other technology companies and the civilian population outside . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the consultation is still ongoing until May 19 . reactions and suggestions from members of the public can be forwarded to the Interior Ministry . &quot;
