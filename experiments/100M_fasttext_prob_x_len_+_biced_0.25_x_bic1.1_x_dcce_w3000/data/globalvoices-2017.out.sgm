<seg id="1">"although I had visited the US at least once a year since 2012, I would live there for the first time now."</seg>
<seg id="2">And that was very exciting for me.</seg>
<seg id="3">My love for America is extraordinarily great.</seg>
<seg id="4">"like many of my generation I grew up with American movies, danced to American music, read American authors and run his sport."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in fact, this country had such a profound effect on me that I was mainly a journalist because of an American film."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as a 14-year-old I saw the great Denzel Washington, as he played Gray Grantham in The Pelican Letter, a fearless reporter who, with the help of Julia Roberts, covered the murderous plot of an oil magnate who wanted to occupy the supreme federal court with judges who were interested in his interest."</seg>
<seg id="7">I was caught.</seg>
<seg id="8">"free to Method Man," I was it, as if this is the absolute truth, forget everything else, that's what I want to do with my life. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and the year I was living in Arizona, my admiration for the USA only intensified."</seg>
<seg id="10">"I always said:" America is the only country in which I have ever lived, whose diversity is so inviting that you can always be the one you are and it is easy to find acceptance in a community of like-minded people. "</seg>
<seg id="11">I even had written a very fanatical love letter about his size.</seg>
<seg id="12">Then Donald Trump came.</seg>
<seg id="13">Much has been written about the xenophobia and racism of this man.</seg>
<seg id="14">The most extraordinary aspect of his ascension is for me how to deal with his narrow-mindedness.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in his opinion, he never stops behind the mountain as it is said so nicely."</seg>
<seg id="16">"he says exactly what he thinks like a former colleague puts it, and openly declares his contempt for Muslims, Latinos, African Americans and women."</seg>
<seg id="17">"nevertheless, people responded to his statements and voted in multitudes for him."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the 13 million votes he won in the Republican elections, was the highest number ever reached by a candidate nominated by the party."</seg>
<seg id="19">I was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="20">"who are the Americans who support this bigotry person, I asked myself?"</seg>
<seg id="21">I couldn't reconcile Trump and his voters with the people I met in Phoenix during my time.</seg>
<seg id="22">"like my professor, Dr. Bill Silcock, Director of the Journalism Program, which receives people from all over the world, a deep believing person with whom I could talk about Islam and his past."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Trumps's view of the world did not agree with that of Peter Bhatia, the current editor of the Cincinnati Inquirer."</seg>
<seg id="24">Bhatia and I met with our common love for basketball and we spent many hours watching the "Phoenix Suns."</seg>
<seg id="25">"trump intolerance is also in contrast to the generosity I experienced at Sandy Bahr, who fought the environment for her life and her husband Dave, my host family, who treated me like her son."</seg>
<seg id="26">She still goes to the engagement of Kristi Kappes who always helped me with much patience and grace and my colleagues to get used to the complexities of American life.</seg>
<seg id="27">"then there were Andrew gooey, Kathryn McManus and Retha Hill, my mentors, whose wise counsel helped me much with my career."</seg>
<seg id="28">These people and the values embodied by them deepened my love for America.</seg>
<seg id="29">"while Trump warned his way to the nominated republican presidential candidate, they offered me a stop and the counterpart to his limited vision of America."</seg>
<seg id="30">But it turned out that they were the exception of the rule.</seg>
<seg id="31">"on 8 November 2016 more than 50 million Americans, mostly White, gave the presidency to a man, despite - or perhaps just because of his contempt against non-white people."</seg>
<seg id="32">"the confrontation with the idea that people voted for Trump because they either shared his racism and fanaticism, or because they were willing to overlook these things, almost broke my heart."</seg>
<seg id="33">Perhaps it is unfair to designate the Trump voters as racists.</seg>
<seg id="34">"to categorize people, said one of my friends, is exactly what led us to this situation."</seg>
<seg id="35">This is superficial and disrespectful and indicates an inability to understand those who act and think in another way.</seg>
<seg id="36">It shows people that their concerns and fears about the hectic changes in their communities are not taken into account.</seg>
<seg id="37">"could it be that these voters, most of whom know, voted for Trump because they want to regain control of a country that has disappointed them?"</seg>
<seg id="38">"in other words, they might say they are still important in this America?"</seg>
<seg id="39">Perhaps.</seg>
<seg id="40">"however, one can hardly forget the words of David Remnick, who commented on the cruel decision to lift up a man who looks down with contempt for those who look different from him."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this" Whitelash "(OB): as much as" "rebellion of the whites against all other ethnicities" "; word play from white in reference to the whites and whiplash, as the great Van Jones mentioned, has exactly killed what America has done so magnificently."</seg>
<seg id="42">"millions of people around the world appreciate the American ideal - no matter whether myth or reality, it is still a powerful idea - whatever belief or background one likes, America welcomes everyone."</seg>
<seg id="43">"for this country chose as its president, twice the son of a Kenyani, whose history, as he himself says, would not be possible anywhere else in the world."</seg>
<seg id="44">"with the election of Donald Trump, however, there is a huge part of the White America's promise of this promise and says: to hell with diversity, freedom of religion and the whole concept of pluralism."</seg>
<seg id="45">"in America after 9 / 11 the white man is again at the helm, they say."</seg>
<seg id="46">"with all this I have to think of Khizr Khan, the father of a soldier who fell in Iraq, and what he said on the eve of the election."</seg>
<seg id="47">"on a rally for Hillary Clinton, Mr. Khan had a change of words with the crowd."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Donald Trump, my son, captain Humayun Kahn, would have a place in your America?" "asked Mr. Khan."</seg>
<seg id="49">The crowd responded with a loud "No!"</seg>
<seg id="50">"would Muslims have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="51">"" "no!" "the crowd roared."</seg>
<seg id="52">"have Latinos a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="53">"no!" they answered.</seg>
<seg id="54">Have Afro-Americans have a place in your America? "</seg>
<seg id="55">"no!" they cried, and their voices cried louder. "</seg>
<seg id="56">"if someone, who is not like you, would have a place in your America?"</seg>
<seg id="57">He received a unanimous and loud "NO"!</seg>
<seg id="58">"Mr. Khan concluded with the words:" thank God, Mr. Trump, is this not your America. "36 hours later he was corrected."</seg>
<seg id="59">"the land for which his son had fallen, sent him a message."</seg>
<seg id="60">"this is Trump Land now, said the message."</seg>
<seg id="61">"and all the people who look like Mr. Khan, could not find a place in this new America."</seg>

<seg id="69">What has the Mexican music school of the Vicente Guerrero Community in the province of Oaxaca with the children of the Paraguayan city of Cateura together?</seg>
<seg id="70">"the music played in both places not only changed the lives of children, but also a very close connection with..."</seg>
<seg id="71">Music that lives with the waste</seg>
<seg id="72">"Vicente Guerrero is located on the edge of a large landfill, only 16 Kilometers south of Oaxaca & # 8212; an old colonial city that is very popular among tourists -but worlds apart from the nearby pre-Columbian ruins and its world-famous cuisine."</seg>
<seg id="73">"for some years now, La banda de Música (Musikbande) has been playing in the community: a symphony orchestra consisting of children and adults, which with their musical instruments has found a way to overcome the surrounding poverty."</seg>
<seg id="74">A music school with 100 students has become a central interest for the community of Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca.</seg>
<seg id="75">The Guardian wrote about this project:</seg>
<seg id="76">"the community, located in one of the poorest provinces of Mexico, is known for its drug abuse and gangs violence."</seg>
<seg id="77">But this changed after a coincidental encounter with a French pilot who started a musical project and offered the youth a rare hope.</seg>
<seg id="78">"the young band members take their commitments to the music group very seriously, writes the local press Noticias Oaxaca NVI:"</seg>
<seg id="79">"as soon as they come from school, they run back home and immediately after lunch they run through the dusty streets to pursue their great passion."</seg>
<seg id="80">"you always come laughing and with shiny eyes and play in the bustle you learn day for day trumpet, trombone, Piccolo, clarinet, oboe, flute, Waldhorn, Pauke, Bongos and the Conga to play."</seg>
<seg id="81">Music from Garbage</seg>
<seg id="82">"more than 7,000 kilometres south of Vicente Guerrero play the children of Cateura - a village that is practically located at the top of the largest garbage dump of Asunción in Paraguay's capital - on instruments made of recycled waste material:"</seg>
<seg id="83">"music with remanufactured instruments made of local solid waste materials, made in a workshop for musical instruments in Cateura, where the recyclers under the direction of Favio Chávez have begun to transform parts of the waste into instruments."</seg>
<seg id="84">"the instruments imitate violins, violas, cellos, double bass, guitars, flutes, saxophones, trumpets, trombones and drums, all of which were made out of trash."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the repertoire includes classical music, folk music, Paraguayan and Latin American music, as well as music of the Beatles, by Frank Sinatra etc."</seg>
<seg id="86">"in an article from the Los Angeles Times, Favio Chávez, a local ecologist and music teacher of the children of Cateura, recalls the early days:"</seg>
<seg id="87">"first it was very difficult, because we had no room for rehearsals and we had to teach at the same place where the parents worked in rubbish. children didn't know music and it was very difficult to contact the parents because many of them did not live together with their children."</seg>
<seg id="88">This changed as Favio something he had never seen before: a violin produced from waste.</seg>
<seg id="89">"today, there is an entire orchestra, which plays on instruments of reprocessed material and is called The Recycled Orchestra."</seg>
<seg id="90">A documentation called "Landfill Harmonic" (Harmonic garbage dump) records the musical performance:</seg>
<seg id="91">The world generates about one billion tons of rubbish each year.</seg>
<seg id="92">"those who live with him and from him are the poorest, like the people in Cateura, Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="93">And here they turn him into something beautiful.</seg>
<seg id="94">Landfill Harmonic follows the orchestra with its inspiring spectacle of trash-to-music around the world.</seg>

<seg id="96">These East African countries show how technology and teamwork can successfully combat illegal fishing</seg>
<seg id="97">Photo © FISH-i Africa - a project that fights wild illegal fishing.</seg>
<seg id="98">"this post, written by Emma Bryce, was originally published at Ensia.com, a magazine specifically about international, practical solutions for environmental issues."</seg>
<seg id="99">The re-release occurs as part of an agreement with Global Voices for the common use of content.</seg>
<seg id="100">"in West Africa, it was known at that time that this ship had already operated illegal fishing in Liberia waters before it visited the other coast of Africa."</seg>
<seg id="101">The East African countries were accordingly upset and not willing to welcome a criminal of this kind on their coasts.</seg>
<seg id="102">"Kenya, Tanzania, Mauritius, the comors, Mozambique and the Seychelles were rapidly mobilizing against the ship. they refused to punish one of their ports and refused to give him a fishing permit."</seg>
<seg id="103">"" "suddenly, the prime minister surrounded by countries that simply refused everything," "recalls Benedict Kiilu, a senior representative of the Kenyan fishing authority. he is part of a team that discovered and persecuted the ship at his time."</seg>
<seg id="104">In 2013 the ship was then driven out of the waters of the region: it was not able to catch fish there.</seg>
<seg id="105">"finally, it was also forced to pay 2 million US dollars to Liberia for pillage of the fish stocks of the country."</seg>
<seg id="106">"the core of this initiative, which investigates criminal practices and protects resources, was FISH-i Africa: a network of countries, 2012 by the NGO Stop Illegal Fishing (halt Illegal Fishing)."</seg>
<seg id="107">"in addition to Somalia and Madagascar, the members of this network were the six countries, who then expelled the prime minister from their waters."</seg>
<seg id="108">"" with this, we have eight countries that are like-minded people and work together. they exchange information and stand at each other where it comes to illegal fishing, "says Tony Long, head of the Pew Charitable trusts project Ending Illegal Fishing. this project offers FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="109">"illegal fishing is regulated by definition: what is caught is hidden, so it is extremely difficult to detect. thus, illegal fishing is a major cause of overfishing of regions."</seg>
<seg id="110">"due to the deliberate disregard of existing laws, by which certain habitats and types are to be protected, illegal fishing can damage ecosystems that have a delicate balance."</seg>
<seg id="111">"while actions against illegal fishing had once been hampered by bureaucratic hurdles and circulated through the snail speed, with the information between individual countries, actions today happen in real time, traceable to FISH-i's digital communications platform."</seg>
<seg id="112">"for example, the individual countries can share lists of existing licenses, news on suspicious activities or details that you have noticed or experienced during a port inspection."</seg>
<seg id="113">Fish-i also draws attention to the activities of ships when they move around the open sea via satellite data.</seg>
<seg id="114">"this makes it possible for the authorities to identify ships that fish in prohibited areas. also, suspicious lanes can be discovered - such as those that indicate that a ship loads its caught fish on the way to other ships."</seg>
<seg id="115">"ideally, such investigations show whether the participating ships have a catch-licence, where they were on the move and possibly whether they have a criminal offense."</seg>
<seg id="116">"countries that are against illegal fishing can, on the basis of this information, refuse to accept such ships in their ports. what means that the ships cannot sell their cargo, and that they can even be forced to pay penalties, as in the case of the prime minister."</seg>
<seg id="117">"" "it's about considerable financial losses for the owner, which means that illegal fishing is no longer worth it."</seg>
<seg id="118">"this is what we want to achieve," "says Per Erik Bergh, Managing Director of NFDS Africa. the latter is a consulting firm dedicated to the fight against illegal fishing in Africa and also supports FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="119">A closed front</seg>
<seg id="120">"the platform already mentioned was created to recover estimated 20 million USD in lost revenue, losing the eight members of the HISH-i network each year due to illegal fishermen entering East African waters."</seg>
<seg id="121">"East Africa has one of the most productive tuna fisheries, which is why the region is attracting commercial fishing from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="122">"such practices include actions such as sailing under false flag, fake license papers, specifying fantasies, fishing of protected species and fishing in nature reserves."</seg>
<seg id="123">"" "they deliberately use the lack of international cooperation and take advantage of the weaknesses of an unbroken organized control system," "says Long." "in the past, a ship was able to fish illegally and a country could then say 'You may not run my port." ""</seg>
<seg id="124">"yet another country could say 'Come to me'." "and this legal loophole tries to close FISH-i."</seg>
<seg id="125">The closed front has so far been working.</seg>
<seg id="126">"since its inception, FISH-i has been involved in more than 30 studies of suspicious vessels."</seg>
<seg id="127">"it has revealed criminal networks that had distributed fake licenses in Tanzania. it discovered ships that used several fraudulent identities, and it has persecuted and found escaping ships."</seg>
<seg id="128">"due to its cooperation with INTERPOL, the international authority to fight crime, FISH-i can share and maintain information about illegal fishing across large distances."</seg>
<seg id="129">"" "some of our investigations lead us quite far into the networks of organised crime," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="130">"he builds a system that will help FISH-i to locate suspicious vessels, more precisely."</seg>
<seg id="131">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="132">"fish-i's satellite system, which is constantly being developed, helps to track down the illegal vessels that love to hide."</seg>
<seg id="133">"" illegal fishermen use very sophisticated techniques to hide their activities and position, "says Duncan Copeland, Chief Analyst at Trygg Mat Tracking, an NGO specializing in fisheries and FISH-i technical support."</seg>
<seg id="134">"some of the ships, for example, turn off their automatic identification systems, with which they can no longer be located by satellites."</seg>
<seg id="135">Copeland is therefore helping to build a system that connects different levels of information. it aims to help FISH-i to find criminal ships with greater precision.</seg>
<seg id="136">One model program</seg>
<seg id="137">But can FISH-i's team of African nations actually influence the unquestionable global problem of illegal fishing?</seg>
<seg id="138">"John Amos, President of the NGO SkyTruth, believes that."</seg>
<seg id="139">"recently, SkyTruth has opened the Global Fishing Watch platform together with Google and the Oceana Marine Protector: a platform that offers satellite data and can be displayed anywhere in the world through the position of every single traceable vessel."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" together with the neighbours to get a better picture of who is doing what they do, it simply makes sense, "he says." here is a chance for countries to unite and to combine their resources for investigation. "</seg>
<seg id="141">"we should do this on a global scale." "Pew Charitable trusts has a similar project where a global system allows prosecution of ships."</seg>
<seg id="142">"there are signs that FISH-i's activities not only detect crimes, but also deter them."</seg>
<seg id="143">Ships which used to fished without a license and had hardly expected any consequences now know they are being watched.</seg>
<seg id="144">"according to Kiilu, some of the countries participating at FISH-i have now a 33% increase in fishing turnover, since fishing boats buy more licenses."</seg>
<seg id="145">"after FISH-i Somalia had helped to track Greko 1, the inspectors found there on board towing nets, whose use is prohibited."</seg>
<seg id="146">Photo courtesy of FISH-i Africa.</seg>
<seg id="147">"other countries also notice these successes." "the effect is so strong that we now also copy other countries," "says Kiilu." "we have become an object of study." "in West Africa every year several hundred million dollars disappear by illegal fishing."</seg>
<seg id="148">"there have joined together six countries in 2015, to the so-called West Africa Task Force. they are also fighting the illegal fishing industry according to the same model as FISH-i." "Safety is the goal of allowing even more such initiatives and structures to emerge in other regions too," "says Copeland."</seg>
<seg id="149">"recently, FISH-i's youngest member state Somalia was able to announce his first great triumph: in October, Greko 1, a ship that was on the road under false flag. and not only was the ship on the road without a license and were used by drag nets which are now banned."</seg>
<seg id="150">"the ship was also invaded in forbidden waters reserved for fishermen from Somalia." "by taking measures against Greko 1 they set a strong sign that they are going against illegal fishing," "says Bergh."</seg>
<seg id="151">"for FISH-i this is another success of many. and at the same time the proof that such a special, collaborative approach to protecting the oceans actually works across the entire world ocean. Emma Bryce is freelance journalist and lives in London. there she writes about the environment, technology and nutrition."</seg>

<seg id="153">The road movements in Venezuela seem to be just the beginning of a wave of violent demonstrations.</seg>
<seg id="154">They are considered a protest against the government's decision to stop the referendum on the administration of President Nicolás Maduro.</seg>

<seg id="158">"under the hashtag # LaTomaDeVenezuela (about the reversing of Venezuela), both these demonstrations and arguments for and against them can be found."</seg>
<seg id="159">"the debate is also carried out in other parts of the country - including the Barinas lowland area, in the Andean regions Mérida and Táchira, in the central North Bundeje Carabobo and on Isla Margarita in the state of Nueva Esparta."</seg>

<seg id="162">"Marianne Díaz, contributor to Global Voices in Venezuela, summarises in her latest article the context of the government decision as follows:"</seg>
<seg id="163">"as part of the social, political and economic crisis, the inflation and profit rate is one of the highest in the whole world (the inflation rate is estimated at 500% of the annual financial year) and in which a serious and widespread lack of food and medicine exists, the referendum on ministerial activity was the only way to give the country the chance to regain its institutional structures and to close a new government alliance."</seg>
<seg id="164">"the electoral alliance Mesa de la Unidad Democrática or shortly MUD (for example: round table of the Democratic Union), in which the opposition parties and political groups joined together, called for a mass rally to support the National Assembly, which, after the elections of 2015, was scheduled to continue on 3 November."</seg>

<seg id="225">I was 15 years old and in the situation I thought that would be ok.</seg>
<seg id="226">"on the military base, I had to destroy papers which had heard the prisoners."</seg>

<seg id="229">"" "then the prisoners are tortured" ""</seg>
<seg id="230">My dad took me four times to La Perla - everything in 1976.</seg>
<seg id="231">At the first and last time he let me wait at the entrance in the car.</seg>
<seg id="232">"when he took me the second time, he ordered me to go out. he led me to a barracks where cars, furniture, TV, fridges - just everything possible - stood."</seg>
<seg id="233">Everything was stolen.</seg>
<seg id="234">"he gave me a small packet wrapped in a blanket and ordered me to carry it to the car. when I opened it, I saw that there was a big lumps of silver."</seg>
<seg id="235">This day I went to the other end of the barracks where the stolen items were put off and kept me with a guard post.</seg>
<seg id="236">Suddenly he pointed to an open space and said:</seg>
<seg id="237">Then the prisoners are tortured.</seg>
<seg id="238">"I saw it, and saw a couch where people were tortured."</seg>
<seg id="239">She looked like a field bed and metal feathers.</seg>
<seg id="240">Later I found out that she had attached to it one end of a cable. the other end was attached to the body of the person who was tied up there.</seg>
<seg id="241">"they rarely tied a man with handcuffs to the bed, poured it with water and chased him a charge of 220 volts into the genitals."</seg>
<seg id="242">Photo: Comisión Provincial de la Memoria</seg>
<seg id="243">The stench there was horrific... like a dirty winder.</seg>
<seg id="244">"years later, when my father was under house arrest, the same smell came out of his room."</seg>
<seg id="245">I immediately realized the smell once more and it became clear to me that this is the smell of a body in need.</seg>
<seg id="246">I never forgot this smell.</seg>
<seg id="247">And I asked myself: how is it possible that one person can do so much suffering to another person?</seg>
<seg id="248">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="249">"when my father took me to work for the third time, he led me to the entrance of La Cuadra - the area where the prisoners were bound with handcuffs and wore eyebrows."</seg>
<seg id="250">"he spoke to" Chubi "Lopez (Jose López, a civilian who was also accused of trial) and I took the opportunity to take a look at La Cuadra."</seg>
<seg id="251">In the background I saw a number of mattresses on which naked people lay with their face down - all were tied at their hands and feet.</seg>
<seg id="252">"near the entrance, people crouched on the mattresses."</seg>
<seg id="253">"when my father noticed that I saw the prisoners, he said," "What do you see, asshole?" ""</seg>
<seg id="254">"I replied," "Why did you bring me down?" ""</seg>
<seg id="255">I knew these people were killed.</seg>
<seg id="256">They were thrown into a pit and killed and buried by soldiers.</seg>
<seg id="257">I know this because my father told about it at home.</seg>
<seg id="258">"in addition to La Cuadra, several rooms were designated as offices."</seg>
<seg id="259">I know that "Palito" Romero crashed and killed a man there.</seg>
<seg id="260">"according to reports of survivors, the civil service Jorge Romero, who was also accused of the La Perla-Ribera trial, died to the students Raúl Mateo Molina."</seg>
<seg id="261">"in the following video, Emilio Fessia, the director of the La Perla Memorial, passes through the former torture chambers."</seg>
<seg id="262">The way you came in here is also the way on which the kidnapped came here.</seg>
<seg id="263">"when you look at the map, you see that they took about this road and then were tortured for the first time."</seg>
<seg id="264">"here, their names were changed and they were assigned a number as part of the process of dehumanization."</seg>
<seg id="265">"when they survived the torture, the prisoners were thrown into the cuadra, until the order from above came that they should be moved."</seg>
<seg id="266">This was the lie - the euphemism - for the shooting of men and the disappearance of their corpses in most cases.</seg>
<seg id="267">The 'war yield'</seg>
<seg id="268">My father brought all sorts of stolen things home.</seg>
<seg id="269">"at that time, I had no idea what the" "war yield" "- as they called it - was."</seg>
<seg id="270">"but when I was in the army later, I was in the gendarmerie - it became clear to me that war spoils are a bayonet, or perhaps military badges that one takes away from an enemy you fought."</seg>
<seg id="271">Luis Alberto Quijano with his son.</seg>
<seg id="272">Archival recording</seg>
<seg id="273">"but when you go into a house and the fridge, the turntable, clothes, paintings, money... steals, then this is not war yield but vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="274">This is stealing.</seg>
<seg id="275">"I have always wondered how my father, the leader of the security forces, could join this vandalism."</seg>
<seg id="276">I simply don't understand.</seg>
<seg id="277">I was also an officer at the gendarmerie and I would never like to enter a house and steal everything in it.</seg>
<seg id="278">I don't understand how my dad could do that.</seg>
<seg id="279">"once he called me a criminal, and I answered," "You who steal the cars on the road?" ""</seg>
<seg id="280">You are not a criminal?</seg>
<seg id="281">"he exploded against anger, struck me and cried,"</seg>
<seg id="282">"if you go so far, I will find you and kill you."</seg>
<seg id="283">We don't need anybody else!</seg>
<seg id="284">So was my father.</seg>
<seg id="285">I have no one good memory of him.</seg>
<seg id="286">"when I went out in the process, I showed a photo of back then, on which I wore a jacket and a jumper pullover made of wool. both had my dad from La Perla."</seg>
<seg id="287">"we were not poor, but he still brought clothes home."</seg>
<seg id="288">"at that time the defense accused me of being a conspirator in this crime. I replied, no problem, they can burden me what they wanted."</seg>
<seg id="289">Anyway I was there to testify.</seg>
<seg id="290">'the disappearance of corpses is the last vile act '</seg>
<seg id="291">"now, where I am older, I feel remorse."</seg>
<seg id="292">"I have children. once you have children, you can see the value of a life."</seg>
<seg id="293">One develops further and realises that it is wrong to kill.</seg>
<seg id="294">I even went so far to say:</seg>
<seg id="295">"well, you have executed people during the dictatorship, but why did the corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="296">Why children kidnap?</seg>
<seg id="297">"one day, my father brought a girl with home, whose mother had been killed."</seg>
<seg id="298">"she was like our pet, almost like a dog - just that this was a little girl."</seg>
<seg id="299">"I always asked myself the question: they were tortured, but why were they killed?"</seg>
<seg id="300">They could have put them in jail.</seg>
<seg id="301">"I guess it has simply been decided to kill these people, but why their corpses disappear?"</seg>
<seg id="302">Did these people not also have families to whom they could hand over their mortal remains?</seg>
<seg id="303">The disappearance of corpses is the last elusive act that one can do to a man.</seg>
<seg id="304">"my father told me when democracy was reintroduced, they took machines to eliminate the mortal remains of the prisoners."</seg>
<seg id="305">"they were crushed and disposed of somewhere - no idea where." you'll never find anything, "my father said."</seg>
<seg id="306">But something remains of course always.</seg>
<seg id="307">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="308">Just to make it clear: I have nothing against the military.</seg>
<seg id="309">I was even at the gendarmerie.</seg>
<seg id="310">I just said the truth about 20 criminals - including my father.</seg>
<seg id="311">The idea of showing my father arose during a conversation when he was under house arrest.</seg>
<seg id="312">I reproached him for all the cruelties that I had to witness because of him.</seg>
<seg id="313">"then he suddenly said," "I don't know. I didn't kill anybody."</seg>
<seg id="314">"I felt inwardly rejected and asked me what all the exaggerated patriotism and the" "Western and Christian feelings" "which they supposedly defended were actually good."</seg>
<seg id="315">Then I cried out:</seg>
<seg id="316">How can you tell me?</seg>
<seg id="317">I have seen how you killed people!</seg>
<seg id="318">You committed terrible crimes and you were forced to join me as a child.</seg>
<seg id="319">"he replied only," "Please forgive me." ""</seg>
<seg id="320">This is exactly what I did.</seg>
<seg id="321">In 2010 I replaced the first ad.</seg>
<seg id="322">I finally realized that he was a criminal.</seg>
<seg id="323">No one can reproach me that I am preoccupied. I have finally cancelled my own father.</seg>
<seg id="324">Luis Alberto Quijano died under house arrest in May 2015 before the end of the trial.</seg>
<seg id="325">"he was charged with 416 offences: including severe, unlawful deprivation of liberty in 158 cases, torture in 154 cases, murder in 98 particularly severe cases, torture followed by death sequence in five cases and a case of kidnapping of one under 10-year-old child."</seg>

<seg id="330">"after four years in which more than 581 witnesses were heard, the historic La Perla-Ribera trial ended because of the crimes committed between March 1975 and December 1978 against 716 victims finally in August."</seg>

<seg id="347">"in the Japanese city of Kyoto, customers of a newly opened centre in which one can prolong his driving licence, in the last month witnesses of a particularly misused translation."</seg>
<seg id="348">"on a sign, the Japanese word was put into the" "older motorists", "the" older motorists, "falsely - but perhaps also with evil rear-thought & # 8212; as" "dreadful motorists". ""</seg>

<seg id="350">"editing of the original screenshot by Joshua Levine, often shared in the social media."</seg>
<seg id="351">"the error was noticed by the translator Julian Holmes, a resident of Kyotos. he was also the one who made aware of the local papers."</seg>
<seg id="352">The Kyoto-published daily Kyoto Shimbun wrote:</seg>
<seg id="353">"" "how could it come to such an English translation?"</seg>
<seg id="354">This proves that no one has read the translation correction.</seg>
<seg id="355">"this is an insult to older people and in an international city like Kyoto simply unacceptable," "said Holmes."</seg>
<seg id="356">"the erroneous English translation was removed initially. the term" "terrible drivers" "was later replaced by the appropriate, though grammatically not quite correct term" "elder drivers" "(German:" older drivers ")."</seg>
<seg id="357">"the police of the Kyoto prefecture have apologized for the translation error. furthermore, she explained that the error was already contained in the text they received from the translator and that the translation was not checked for its accuracy before it was published."</seg>
<seg id="358">A blogger reported as follows about the apology:</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are sincerely sorry that elderly people felt offended by the inadequate correction (translation)," the police said. "</seg>
<seg id="360">The Japanese online intelligence service J-Cast News deals with the phenomenon of the "awful" older motorists in Japan and wrote:</seg>
<seg id="361">"the word" "awful" "was denounced as an inappropriate description of older motorists. according to the police, the proportion of older motorists, who are involved in accidents throughout the country, is a reason for concern."</seg>
<seg id="362">"in the Kyoto prefecture, for example, 1,941 of a total of 19,460 accidents were caused by seniors in 2005. this corresponds to a proportion of 10%."</seg>

<seg id="364">This increased its share to 17.7%.</seg>
<seg id="365">"while the number of accidents has decreased overall, the proportion of incidents caused by seniors has increased in the same period."</seg>
<seg id="366">"the reporter, named not named, brought comments to the light in the version of the article published on Yahoo, which show what prejudices some Japanese apparently heeded against older motorists:"</seg>

<seg id="376">The reasons for the wide distribution of translation errors are manifold.</seg>
<seg id="377">"for translating, you need two important skills: passive language skills in order to understand the source text and take active language skills to translate it into the target language."</seg>
<seg id="378">"the latter requires the active domination of the target language - something that is the case with native speakers. in general, the conviction that translators in the target language should not be native speakers."</seg>
<seg id="379">"for example, a French native speaker should translate from English into French - not from French to English."</seg>
<seg id="380">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="381">"many Japanese companies do not employ English as their native language, which could produce translations into English. this may be due to a lack of understanding for translating, cost reasons or the relatively low number of English native speakers who learn Japanese."</seg>
<seg id="382">"some companies, who do not have a foreign employee themselves, nevertheless make translations available internally. then, the Japanese employee, whose English skills are considered the best, are made to the translator - no matter how good or bad his language skills really are."</seg>
<seg id="383">Photo by Flickr user Karl Baron.</seg>
<seg id="384">Mechanical translations are also widely used - often with funny results.</seg>
<seg id="385">"the confused and enigmatic sentences, created by machine translations, show that this technique can't replace a human translator for a long time. this is especially true for some languages."</seg>
<seg id="386">"some of the strangest English formulations in Japan, including the enigmatic imprints, which often decorate shirts or bags, are only used for stylistic reasons - not to be read or understood."</seg>
<seg id="387">Photo by Flickr user Joseph Brent.</seg>
<seg id="388">"translation errors may be acceptable or at least harmless as jewellery. however, by large companies or by the government who have the means to ensure higher standards, we can expect more careful translations."</seg>
<seg id="389">"in the future, the city of Kyoto will hopefully make use of a more serious source for its translations."</seg>

<seg id="391">"main page of the portal" Navegar con Libertad "(Free surfing) of the IPYS (Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, Institute for Press and Society)."</seg>
<seg id="392">"on Friday morning, 7 April, Venezuelan Internet users reported that they had no access to the Vivoplay online channel."</seg>

<seg id="394">"other online transmitters carried out recordings of the protests in Caracas, organised by opposition groups, who oppose the government of Nicolás Maduros."</seg>
<seg id="395">"the protests began at the beginning of April, after the Supreme Court dissolved the Parliament and had transferred the Parliament's tasks to the executive and the Supreme Court itself."</seg>
<seg id="396">"Luis Carlos Díaz, journalist and author at Global Voices, published the results of a traceroutes. he pointed out that the connection was chapped, and advised the users to use VPN (virtual private networks) to access the Internet."</seg>

<seg id="412">"in Paraguay, many girls become slaves to obtain an education"</seg>
<seg id="413">Tina Alvarenga was a Criadita as a child. now she visits the house where she worked for years.</seg>
<seg id="414">"today, Tina is fighting for the rights of children and collecting testimonies from other Criaditas, who were just as victims of abuse and discrimination."</seg>

<seg id="416">The following article is the shortened version of a cursed report published by Global Voices with the kind permission of the authors.</seg>
<seg id="417">"the article is part of a series entitled" Vacas que vuelan, Escuelas que Caen, "which is edited and re-published by Global Voices Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="418">Tina Alvarenga lived for eight years in a household where she was not allowed to eat together with the family who lived there.</seg>
<seg id="419">Shortly before her graduation at the university she returned to the house and heard how the owner of the house was full of pride about her. "she is like a daughter for us.</seg>
<seg id="420">"she, who has become something," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="421">But Tina Alvarenga was never treated like a daughter in this house.</seg>
<seg id="422">"when she was ten years old, she began to work as Criadita for the family. as Criaditas, in Paraguay the more than 46.000 cubs and girls were forced to work to go to school."</seg>
<seg id="423">"the business is quite simple: a big family with little money transfers their underage son or her minor daughter to another, more rich family. in exchange, the child receives food, training and a roof above the head."</seg>
<seg id="424">"what is not mentioned, however, is that the children have to do housework innumerable days that can never be paid and victims of abuse and abuse - and all this within the framework of a contract that cannot be abolished."</seg>
<seg id="425">"this practice, described as Criadazgo, is widespread in Paraguay due to the participation and acceptance by large parts of society and despite numerous complaints by human rights organisations."</seg>
<seg id="426">"after graduating, Alvarenga worked for a few years for an organization that fights for the rights of boys and girls."</seg>
<seg id="427">"she talked to Criadia - especially young girls affected by the practice of Criadazgo - collected testimonies, researching and denouncing."</seg>
<seg id="428">"she tried to call things by name, because the feeling of gratitude which is inoculated to Crimean tas warrants silence in general."</seg>
<seg id="429">"the Criadazgo is based on double deception," explains Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="430">"on the one hand, the family who has their daughter in believing that they complete their education, improve their position in society and" "make something out" "can be handed over to another family."</seg>
<seg id="431">"on the other hand, the family that assimilates the girl with herself and justifies her exploitation by believing that she would give someone a chance that would otherwise have no training and perhaps even starved."</seg>
<seg id="432">The victims of Criminazgo</seg>
<seg id="433">"when the girl is mistreated, his family will learn about it for many years."</seg>
<seg id="434">Sometimes they never experience it.</seg>
<seg id="435">"in January 2016, the hitherto relatively unknown phenomenon, which takes place in the secret of Paraguayan households, got a face."</seg>
<seg id="436">"when Carolina Marín came to the hospital in Caaguazú, her body showed traces of violent blows. shortly thereafter she died."</seg>
<seg id="437">She was 14 years old.</seg>
<seg id="438">"she was Criparta in the household of the former military man Tomás Ferreira and his wife Ramona Melgarejo, who works as a civil servant at the Einwohnermeldeamt."</seg>
<seg id="439">"Marín lived with them in their house in Vaquería, a small town with just 3,000 inhabitants 250 kilometers east of the capital Asunción."</seg>
<seg id="440">"at the end of January 2016, Ferreira entered Marín as long as she suffered lethal injury."</seg>
<seg id="441">This should be the last punishment in the life of the young girl.</seg>
<seg id="442">"a few days later, the media reported the incident."</seg>
<seg id="443">They stressed that the murdered child was a Criadita.</seg>
<seg id="444">Organizations such as UNICEF or Callescuela made the deeply rooted practice of Criadazgo responsible for the death of the girl in the Paraguayan society.</seg>
<seg id="445">They called the Critiazgo as "a modern form of slavery."</seg>
<seg id="446">Several dozen people came together to protest demonstrations and demanded that there could be "no further Carolina" in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="447">The girl's name and photos were widely used in social media.</seg>
<seg id="448">"in Paraguay, more cows are registered as children," says Tina Alvarenga. "</seg>
<seg id="449">Without papers it is much easier to injure the rights of children.</seg>
<seg id="450">Without official documents it is very difficult to control under which conditions boys and girls live.</seg>
<seg id="451">The neighbours of the couple and nearly 60 civil society organisations called for swift investigation of the case.</seg>
<seg id="452">"they want Tomás Ferreira and Ramona Melgarejo for the murder of the girl who was their Criparta, sentenced to 30 years in prison."</seg>
<seg id="453">"if the case occurs in court, the case of Carolina Marín might be trend-setting - if for the first time in the history of Paraguay a case of Criadazgo comes to court."</seg>
<seg id="454">The everyday life of a Criadita</seg>
<seg id="455">"the Criaditas are not only exploited as workers, they also live isolated from other girls at their age."</seg>
<seg id="456">"Tina Alvarenga was ten years old when the Farbik, in which her father worked, had to sign up bankruptcy and her father lost his job."</seg>
<seg id="457">"their brothers now had to work all the way and began selling sweets on the street, or on the market, to earn money."</seg>
<seg id="458">But they all went on to school.</seg>
<seg id="459">Only Tina was sent as Criadita to the capital Asunción.</seg>
<seg id="460">"in the house of their employers, Alvarenga worked between four and six hours each day."</seg>
<seg id="461">She had to divide the time in such a way that she still had time to learn.</seg>
<seg id="462">She rose every morning at five o'clock and prepared the breakfast for her employer.</seg>
<seg id="463">"for example, they cleaned the fridge, cleaned the living room, polished the furniture and disinfected the floor."</seg>
<seg id="464">"when the school was over, she went home again and had time to learn."</seg>
<seg id="465">"the more she was finished with learning, the more free time she had."</seg>
<seg id="466">But also this time was limited because they had to make dinner for their employers.</seg>
<seg id="467">"Alvarenga says she never had to starve, but didn't get unlimited food." I was allowed to pick more books from the master's library than eating out the fridge, "she recalls."</seg>

<seg id="500">"Pixabay image, changed by Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="501">Published under the Public Domain CC0.</seg>
<seg id="502">Sixty Egyptian MPs have recently voted on a bill to "regulate the use and use of social networks."</seg>
<seg id="503">"if adopted by the Parliament, users must register social media in Egypt at a government authority to use social media including Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="504">"" "on the basis of the law, a place would then be set up which is mandated to give citizens permission to grant social media."</seg>
<seg id="505">"within six months of accepting the Act, users would have to register on the site of the site with their correct names and identity cards in order to be able to use social networks."</seg>
<seg id="506">"if this fails to do so, this could bring a penalty of up to six months imprisonment or a fines."</seg>
<seg id="507">"the bill composed of six paragraphs and curtailed in local media including Youm7 and Egypt Independent, defines social media as" any application that runs through the Internet and is used to communicate with others by voice, videophone and text. "</seg>
<seg id="508">"it is unclear how the law is enforced when it is accepted, as the draft does not indicate how Egyptian authorities are supposed to impose the registration. it is unclear how they should make up those who do not register in the face of the fact that the Egyptian government is not currently able to ensure regulation at the level of social media companies."</seg>
<seg id="509">"Riyad Abdul Sattar, Parliamentary deputy and promoter of the bill, told the magazine Al-Monitor, registered users received a username and password from the ministry of telecommunications to get through the firewall that blocks Facebook."</seg>
<seg id="510">"this could mean that Egypt plans to build a firewall on a national level around Facebook. because of those, it would be necessary for Egyptians to submit information on their identity to access the network."</seg>
<seg id="511">But it is not known until now that such plans exist.</seg>
<seg id="512">Experts on site are sceptical about the technical feasibility of the proposal.</seg>
<seg id="513">"Ramy Raoof, Senior Research Technologist (in German" leading research scientist ") of the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR, in German" Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights "), said Global Voices:"</seg>
<seg id="514">I doubt the technical capacity and understanding of any authority in Egypt regarding things that have to do with technology.</seg>
<seg id="515">"in my opinion, they imagine that just as they violently control physical public and private spaces it could also be done online."</seg>
<seg id="516">"if I take them seriously, that means they will set up a powerful surveillance system to filter citizens who request permission or not. and that means a mad system to monitor the activities of people and also to bring them to a court process."</seg>
<seg id="517">This is by no means realistic - but in Egypt all is possible.</seg>
<seg id="518">"in order to be adopted as a law, the draft must first be discussed in the Parliament's legislative and constitutional committees before it enters the plenary debate."</seg>
<seg id="519">"whether its adoption and enforcement will be successful or not, the draft" stands in line with a pro-military way of thinking in parliament, in which the control is maximized and safeguarded, "says Raoof."</seg>
<seg id="520">"last year, the parliamentary delegate Tamer El-Shahawy proposed a bill against cyber crime in which a life imprisonment sentence for those found guilty of threatening" "public order" "and" "to protest protests." ""</seg>

<seg id="525">"high up in the mountains of the Kurdistan Region in the north-east of Iraq, the animal protector Hana Ahmed Raza and her team of scientists from the NGO Nature Iraq are working to protect the ghost of the Persian leopard."</seg>
<seg id="526">"a subspecies of the larger family of leopards, which roams through Africa and Asia, belong to the Persian leopards (Panthera pardus saxicolor). altogether there are between 800 and 1,000 animals, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature. they are endangered due to Wilderei, the loss and fragmentation of their habitat and since they find less and less loot."</seg>
<seg id="527">Why is this particular kind of leopard so important?</seg>
<seg id="528">"as Raza shows in the video," "the Persian leopard is the only remaining predator in the Kurdish ecosystem" "and the health and prosperity of the ecosystem depends also on that a large predator is present."</seg>
<seg id="529">"the chance to see a Persian leopard actually in the wild is low and goes against zero. as the team in the video shows that they have a picture of a big cat in the camera, Raza breaks out in pure joy."</seg>

<seg id="544">"at the beginning of March 2017, the Kahoku Shimpo, the pro-northeastern Japan, has documented the progress that has been achieved over the past six years to reconstruct the lives of those affected by the" triple disaster "of March 2011. a huge earthquake, a tsunami and an atom earthquake in Fukushima had caused the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper has its headquarters in Sendai, which is located in Miyagi Prefecture. Miyagi prefecture was a few prefectures in Japan's northeast, which had to experience both the earthquake and the resulting tsunami."</seg>
<seg id="546">Hundreds of thousands of people from Miyagi and the neighbouring villages Fukushima and Iwate were forced to evacuate because the tsunami had removed entire coastal cities from the map.</seg>
<seg id="547">"in addition, Fukushima Prefecture has experienced a nuclear accident, even so alone 160 000 inhabitants had to leave their homes."</seg>
<seg id="548">"the special report of the Kahoku Shimpo shows, from the local perspective, what progress has been achieved six years later in order to rebuild the lives of local residents."</seg>
<seg id="549">The detailed report of the newspaper contains both statistics of the Japanese rebuilding authority and survey results of the affected persons themselves.</seg>
<seg id="550">"the apartment building in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate"</seg>
<seg id="551">"the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper reports that until December 2015, a total of 77 percent of the planned replacements (which were completed, were completed in Fukushima, Miyagi and Iwate prefectures)."</seg>
<seg id="552">"Miyagi was the biggest success among the three prefectures, 80 percent of the planned replacements were completed."</seg>
<seg id="553">"Iwate has completed 75 percent of such houses, whereas Fukushima accounts for 70 percent of the closing light."</seg>
<seg id="554">"however, six years after the catastrophe, it is still possible to relocate evacuated temporary shelters to final replacement houses six years after the catastrophe."</seg>
<seg id="555">"after the triple catastrophe, almost 80 000 people were forced to live in homes."</seg>
<seg id="556">"in December 2016, still 36 000 people from Miyagi, Fukushima and Iwate lived in such homes."</seg>
<seg id="557">"almost 40 percent of the evacuees from Fukushima in 2011 still live in emergency shelters, whereas Miyagi was more successful here. more than 75 percent of the evacuees, who built after the disaster in homes, were relocated to final homes."</seg>
<seg id="558">"for Iwate, the figure is 34 percent."</seg>
<seg id="559">The state of work and everyday life in the three prefectures affected</seg>
<seg id="560">"as the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper was able to establish, 1074 of 1100 schools, affected by misfortune, opened their doors until December 2016, which accounts for almost 98 percent of the schools of the three prefectures."</seg>
<seg id="561">Six years later it is clear that industrial reconstruction in the three prefectures is much more difficult.</seg>
<seg id="562">"while almost 100 per cent of the fishing harbours in Iwate and Miyagi are now in operation, only 30 per cent of the fishing harbours have resumed their operation in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="563">"the tsunami and the nuclear accident, in the three prefectures of the agrarian country, have largely affected agricultural land."</seg>
<seg id="564">"Miyagi was able to restore 93 percent of its agricultural areas, with only 66 percent of the farmland in Iwate and less than 50 per cent destroyed agricultural land in Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="565">"it is unlikely that this is just a consequence of the nuclear accident, because only 690 hectares of 5 400 hectares of land destroyed by Fukushima, are located in the" nuclear lock zone. ""</seg>
<seg id="566">"in two of the three prefectures, tourism has recovered largely, but Fukushima is also far removed."</seg>
<seg id="567">"the tourist figures in Miyagi and Iwate are again 90 percent at the same level, as before disaster. Fukushima, on the other hand, can only have 75 percent."</seg>
<seg id="568">"however, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper also reports that since the disaster nearly half of the coastal inhabitants, it seems to be more difficult to earn their living."</seg>
<seg id="569">Is the local population prepared for the next big earthquake?</seg>
<seg id="570">"in order to determine the overall picture, the paper conducted numerous surveys among the local population and among the evacuees. it questioned them about the state of reconstruction and also how their feeling changed vis-à-vis the tsunami risk."</seg>
<seg id="571">"in its introduction, the Kahoku Shimpo newspaper explains:"</seg>
<seg id="572">The Kahoku Shimpo conducted a survey to bring more about the tsunami awareness among the local population.</seg>
<seg id="573">The survey revealed that 83.1 percent of local residents have taken measures to prepare for future earthquakes and tsunamis.</seg>
<seg id="574">"however, 55.9 percent of respondents find that still not enough in terms of catastrophes prevention has been done."</seg>
<seg id="575">How it stands for those who had to be evacuated from Fukushima Prefecture</seg>
<seg id="576">"in her edition to commemorate the anniversary of the earthquake, the Kahoku Shimpo Newspaper emphasized her attention to the situation of the evacuees from Fukushima."</seg>
<seg id="577">"Fukushima had to witness not only the massive earthquake and devastating tsunami, no, Fukushima Prefecture was also a witness of the worst, disaster-caused, nuclear accident that Japan had ever witnessed."</seg>
<seg id="578">"of 160 000 evacuees from Fukushima, nearly 63 000 people were relocated to areas outside the prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="579">"at the beginning of 2016 there were a little more than 23,000 people, back to Fukushima, converted into permanent substitutes."</seg>
<seg id="580">"after the state of 2017, more and more 40,000 inhabitants of Fukushima resides outside their home prefecture."</seg>
<seg id="581">"in the disaster areas most of the evacuees are older than 50 years old. they are known to bring back their efforts to rebuild Miyagi, Iwate and Fukushima with massive construction projects. these are construction projects that are part of the Olympic Games that will take place in Tokyo by 2020."</seg>

<seg id="626">"with the introduction of the law of Álvaro Reynoso, almost hundreds of sugar cane factories throughout Cuba joined the doors (photo: Julio Batista)"</seg>
<seg id="627">"the folk community Gregorio Arleé Mañalich, located in the western Cuban province of Mayabeque, is commonly known as el Central - in Spanish sugar mill - no noteworthy sugar harvest on site."</seg>
<seg id="628">It is two years since the activities in the sugar cane factories were paralysed.</seg>
<seg id="629">"after the earthquake, the sugar cane industry stood still in the region, and the factory gradually lost its facilities until only the scaffolding of steel and concrete remained."</seg>
<seg id="630">About 272 workers had to reinvent themselves.</seg>
<seg id="631">Some changed the work.</seg>
<seg id="632">Others resign and commute daily to the factories that still grind.</seg>
<seg id="633">"Nene, a soldier veteran, who rises every day at 4: 00 in the morning, the crisis in the sugar cane industry does not deprive his sleep."</seg>
<seg id="634">"he heard that there are sugar cane factories in the east of the region, which are in operation again after a long inactive period because they were preserved."</seg>
<seg id="635">That was something he did not expect.</seg>
<seg id="636">"Nene remembers accurately to have heard that in Mañalich the sugar cane plant would be preserved, but the promise was not kept."</seg>
<seg id="637">"the sugar cane industry already resisted the plagues, the fall of socialism, low market prices, inefficiency, poor management decisions and climate change."</seg>
<seg id="638">"in 2016, production amounted to 1.6 million tonnes of sugar, less than the volume produced in 1910."</seg>
<seg id="639">"the news would have been a motive for concern for the country a few decades ago, but the bad harvests are no news."</seg>
<seg id="640">Why was the Cuban sugar cane industry switched off?</seg>
<seg id="641">The old platform of the church saw even better times.</seg>
<seg id="642">(photo: Julio Batista)</seg>
<seg id="643">The reduction of the sugar cane industry was an economic necessity: the 155 sugar cane factories were technically outdated and hardly competitive they became intolerable for the country.</seg>
<seg id="644">"the initial idea was to concentrate production on the most efficient factories, the annual production objective was 4 million tonnes."</seg>
<seg id="645">They left only the factories that could produce sugar for a maximum of 4 Centavos (0.03 euros).</seg>
<seg id="646">The solution for unemployment?</seg>
<seg id="647">The motives that led to such measures were the low productivity of sugar cane plantations and the sugar crisis on the world market.</seg>
<seg id="648">"however, the sugar price rose again about a decade ago."</seg>
<seg id="649">"the price of unrefined sugar between 15 and 16 Centavos per pound must remain between 2017 and 2025, according to the report published in 2016 by the OECD and the FAO, the Food and Nutrition Organisation of the United Nations."</seg>
<seg id="650">"if current production would reach the level of 2001 (3.6 million tonnes), raw sugar exports would generate about 85 million dollars for the country."</seg>

<seg id="662">"all were signed by Ulises Rosales del Toro, only the minister could approve every withdrawal."</seg>
<seg id="663">"from then on, the responsibility was handed over and the letters were getting more and more frequent."</seg>
<seg id="664">"for two years, Juan Carlos Rivero was responsible for the shut-down factory and he was one who received the letters." the country had no money for the sugar cane factories that were still in operation, "he assures."</seg>

<seg id="676">"without work in the region, and with advanced age, Nene and Eddy had to look for other factories."</seg>
<seg id="677">They were made to spare parts.</seg>
<seg id="678">"without prospects for the future, many young people left the region."</seg>
<seg id="679">"in the area there was created a food factory, whose production is not even for the care of the community."</seg>

<seg id="692">Young people of the First Nations communities in all of Canada deal with topics that are important to them. they do this by means of Hip-Hop thanks to a number of hiking workshops.</seg>
<seg id="693">"as part of the N'we Jinan-Tour since 2014, workshop leaders bring mobile recording studios directly to schools and youth centres to teach youth groups songwriting, recording, audio and video production and live performances."</seg>
<seg id="694">"the original workshops were led by pedagogue David Hodges, who lives in Montreal and worked in North-Quebec with ten Cree communities and then collaborated with the Cree Hip-Hop group The NorthStars."</seg>
<seg id="695">"the workshop begins with the fact that the young participants explore topics such as" cultural identity, language, engagement, love, self-acceptance "or whatever comes to them."</seg>
<seg id="696">These questions are inspiration for songs and videos in which the young people are the protagonists.</seg>
<seg id="697">"because the workshops were so popular, the team also worked with other First Nations communities in the Canadian province of British Columbia and was invited to organize similar workshops with the tribe of the Winnebago in Nebraska."</seg>
<seg id="698">"this video of the school 'Na Aksa Gyilak' Yoo in the area of the tribal school First Nation in British Columbia, for example, tells the story of Highway 16, also called" Highway of tears, "a section of road in West Africa where almost two dozen mostly indigenous young women disappeared or murdered."</seg>
<seg id="699">"for the most part, the cases were not elucidated."</seg>
<seg id="700">The next video of the Nemaska Cree First Nation uses the motif of a video game to convey how important the preservation of traditional customs and customs despite the influence of globalisation.</seg>
<seg id="701">"many of the songs appeared in indigenous languages, although the youths do not always dominate the languages of the First Nations."</seg>
<seg id="702">"in the following song, that the Whapmagoostui Cree First Nation has recorded, the refrain is sung on Cree."</seg>
<seg id="703">"the young people involved received some help from Gary Jolly from the Northstar Hip-Hop-Group, who gave them a strophe in the Eastern James Bay Cree dialect."</seg>
<seg id="704">"on the Facebook page of N'we Jinan, the verse is available in transcript as well as a translation into English, which is translated into German here:"</seg>
<seg id="705">Sometimes I feel like no one would ever be interested in me</seg>
<seg id="706">But I try to go on my days on Earth</seg>
<seg id="707">This is the day when you will embrace our cry</seg>
<seg id="708">Because we have lost our way in life as a youth</seg>
<seg id="709">But I believe that we will rise one day</seg>
<seg id="710">I don't want to see how they live a bad life</seg>
<seg id="711">"thus, they can grow and move forward with our youth as well."</seg>
<seg id="712">This is how they can do what they have ordained by the Creator.</seg>

<seg id="718">"in Japan, one can see some plastic dishes in front of almost every restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="719">"to show potential customers what is exactly on the menu, they are displayed near the entrance shokuhin sanpuru (" "plastic models of the dishes" ") of any food served in this restaurant."</seg>
<seg id="720">Customers can see these plastic dishes and decide whether they are entering or continuing the restaurant.</seg>
<seg id="721">There is a whole industry dedicated to the production of these plastic dishes.</seg>
<seg id="722">"in the Tokyo district of Kappabashi, there are a large number of these small businesses that precisely produce those plastic dishes that the German filmmaker Wim Wenders documented in his film Tokyo-Ga more than 20 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="723">"for most Japanese, these plastic dishes are so common that they do not even notice them. however, a new trend is now transforming them into showy mobile accessories and other gadgets."</seg>
<seg id="724">At Naver Matome the Blogger itinii published a number of social media links and photos that show this unusual twist with the shokuhin sanpuru.</seg>

<seg id="730">For this triangular bowl (lol) we found a good use as a mobile stand.</seg>

<seg id="735">"some mobile phone stand and mobile designer allow you to make your own work of art. in this case, ikura and laughswindy are used, a popular topping that is served with white rice."</seg>
<seg id="736">"on Twitter, some users had their doubts:"</seg>
<seg id="737">"is there somebody who would say" "wow, cool, now I can decorate my mobile with laughing cheers?" ""</seg>
<seg id="738">I think I'll be the only one.</seg>
<seg id="739">"this interest in plastic dishes can also take a less appetizing form, for example to surprise colleagues or family members uncomfortable."</seg>

<seg id="749">"in reports of domestic and foreign media about the notorious" "fight against drug trafficking" "in Mexico, the suspicions and the killed regularly appear only in statistics. however, they do not reflect the extent of the human tragedy that entails this struggle."</seg>
<seg id="750">"reporting on drugs bosses such as El Chapo Guzmán, the leader of the Sinaloa cartel, completely overthrew the stories of the victims of the conflict."</seg>
<seg id="751">"the day after a violent incident, hardly anybody looks at the bereaved or the churches that have learned to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="752">"behind each body, behind each bone find in the hundreds of secret graves, the stories of countless parents, sons and daughters, friends and partners whose wounds may never be healed."</seg>
<seg id="753">"this is why the Mexican news portal Animal Político launched the digital project" "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco" "(German:" "learning with Drug Trafficking" "), which tells the victims a voice and tells stories of people who were in the struggle between the law enforcement authorities and cartels."</seg>
<seg id="754">Animal Político describes the project like this:</seg>
<seg id="755">Organised crime does not only allow us to fear our lives.</seg>
<seg id="756">The effects are much more profound.</seg>
<seg id="757">"for example, when shops close because they are threatened by drug dealers and entire communities need to drive many kilometers to buy something as simple as milk."</seg>
<seg id="758">The pain of the victims</seg>
<seg id="759">A video entitled "Vidas que Cambian por el miedo" (German: "how fear life changes") tells exactly these stories.</seg>
<seg id="760">"a main character is Guadalupe, a father who searches secret tombs for his son every weekend."</seg>
<seg id="761">"Emma Veleta Rodríguez, who only one day lost her father, her four brothers, her husband and two of her nephews."</seg>
<seg id="762">"priest:" "like every Sunday, we are preparing ourselves again today for the task that we have set ourselves to go and search for tombs, according to the people we have loved."</seg>
<seg id="763">Guadalupe Contreras: "my son is Antonio Ivan Contreras Mata.</seg>
<seg id="764">He was 28 when he disappeared.</seg>
<seg id="765">He has three children.</seg>
<seg id="766">He worked in an electric shop in El Naranjo.</seg>
<seg id="767">On 13 October he left the house.</seg>
<seg id="768">"on October 15th, he should be back again, but he never came back." Emma Veleta: "it's very difficult for me because I am now alone with three children who need training."</seg>
<seg id="769">"there is also my mother, who is here with me too."</seg>
<seg id="770">At the moment she has no income.</seg>
<seg id="771">"you are the insurance of my father, but it won't pay you off because they require a death certificate."</seg>
<seg id="772">Where should we get that?</seg>
<seg id="773">The editors of "Aprender a vivir con el Narco" explain why the project is so important:</seg>
<seg id="774">"we must not only show the faces of those who are afraid. we must show the international community the conflicts, fragility and governance."</seg>
<seg id="775">The project is based on stories of readers and reports of journalists in high-risk areas.</seg>
<seg id="776">Here are some excerpts from the stories.</seg>
<seg id="777">"KYHB, a reader of Animal Político, wrote this post from Taxco, in the Federal State of Guerrero in central Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="778">"their contribution reminds us that violence should never be regarded as normal, no matter what form it occurs:"</seg>
<seg id="779">I have known disease and journalism for several years now.</seg>
<seg id="780">"I come to newspaper kiosks every day and see the front pages with pictures, which can only come from a textbook for criminology or from specialists from specialists."</seg>
<seg id="781">It brings me out of the frame.</seg>
<seg id="782">Sometimes I feel as if I am the only one that is disgusted or sad. it works like a lack of respect for the person who once belonged to this body.</seg>
<seg id="783">I can't be indifferent about it or consider this as normal.</seg>
<seg id="784">She writes on:</seg>
<seg id="785">"no, it's not normal that my 10-year-old cousin thinks that he wants to become Narco (German: drug dealers) when he is big. and it's also not normal that people hear songs about the" heroism "of the offenders when they go through the streets."</seg>
<seg id="786">"for me this is as if they ridiculed those who have lost someone, and those who are afraid that something happens to them."</seg>
<seg id="787">I see our weakness if stories become mere numbers in a statistic.</seg>
<seg id="788">"people's hopelessness is incredible for me when the death of six people and the disappearance of 43 students in a neighboring village should be justified, that they were" "soaked". ""</seg>
<seg id="789">"I think they try to convince themselves that they remain spared from such tragedies, if they do not stir and remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="790">"Maribel L. from Mexico City wrote the article" Four months blackmail in the main town district: how a family was sacked with threats. ""</seg>
<seg id="791">You think of everything you have lost and how some people can completely change your whole life in just a few days.</seg>
<seg id="792">"the pain of this never passes away, the trauma remains, the fear comes up again when you are alone."</seg>
<seg id="793">"habits have changed, phone numbers too."</seg>
<seg id="794">We only contact us if it is absolutely necessary.</seg>
<seg id="795">"the farther we are from each other, the better."</seg>
<seg id="796">She closed her report with the words:</seg>
<seg id="797">"we want others to be arrested, because you don't know when they will kidnap you or kill you."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I asked myself in these terrible days whether tears would dissolve my deep-rooted feelings, but the answer is no, because I forgot how to weep. I must learn to live with the pain."</seg>
<seg id="799">The journalist Mario Gutiérrez Vega has published the article "The forgotten children of Ciudad Juárez: a generation drawn by violence."</seg>
<seg id="800">In the introduction he raises questions like: who cares about the child of a missing wife and a man who was murdered by organised crime?</seg>
<seg id="801">How is it to grow in a settlement on the outskirts of the most dangerous city of Mexico?</seg>
<seg id="802">"he is not like other boys of his age, whose parents care about them."</seg>
<seg id="803">"Bryan is a orphan and he tells that he had to teach himself how to cook an egg, cook potatoes, make tortillas warm and" chichi "for the babies who live with it. this is his name for preparing the bottles with water, sugar and milk powder."</seg>
<seg id="804">He tells of the nine scars on his left leg - one for each year of life.</seg>
<seg id="805">But they are insignificant compared to the pain in his eyes - unspeakably for a boy for whom the whole life consists of violence and who had to learn to live with it.</seg>
<seg id="806">"when he was five years old, he told him that his mother had disappeared."</seg>
<seg id="807">But this was not the day when his childhood ended.</seg>
<seg id="808">"his childhood was past two years before, when he was just a few blocks from his home, who saw the bloody corpse of his father shot by armed men from a passing car."</seg>
<seg id="809">When Bryan was born the situation in Juárez looked like this:</seg>
<seg id="810">Bryan was born in 2006 when violence through organised crime and the struggle against the existing social problems in Juárez was missing.</seg>
<seg id="811">"in 2008, 2009 and 2010, Juárez was the most dangerous city in the world due to the number of murders according to the Public Security Council and the Government of the United States Government."</seg>
<seg id="812">"in 2010 alone, the Public Prosecutor's Office amounted to 3103 Morde. this corresponds to an average of 8.5 Mordes per day."</seg>
<seg id="813">These are just a few hundreds of thousands of stories that leave the organized crime in Mexico and enter into the soul of the country.</seg>
<seg id="814">Only a few stories live in the face of ever new headlines. but this project reminds us of those we are not allowed to forget.</seg>
<seg id="815">"in addition to the project" "Aprender a Vivir Con El Narco", "Animal Político launched the data journalism project Narcodata, whose goal is to illustrate the complex information behind the failed fight against drug trafficking, which has tortured the country in the last four decades."</seg>

<seg id="929">The photograph was used with regard to greater discussions about silence in connection with the assassination of Christians by Muslims or - for the defense of Muslims - the assassination of the Rohingyas by Buddhists.</seg>

<seg id="934">"suggests this sentiment of false and false information that actual atrocities are untrue and makes it the real horror of what has actually happened in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria and Myanmar?"</seg>
<seg id="935">The spread of violent images has already been extensively debated (for example).</seg>
<seg id="936">"one argument is that withholding images of a refusal is equivalent to recognizing the tragedy. sometimes, these images are even demanded by the victims themselves."</seg>
<seg id="937">"at the same time, the concern is that violent imagery will desensitize readers and viewers and take the ability to feel empathy (such as this study, which investigates how violent media work on helping others)."</seg>
<seg id="938">"while there is a lot to discuss about violent representations in the news media, the fact is that they are indispensable for today's news reporting."</seg>
<seg id="939">"technologists experiment with algorithms to support the fight against" "fake news". "they will have to think thoroughly about the situation in which a picture suggests something, but what actually can be used from context or completely abusive nature."</seg>

<seg id="1139">"here, however, the focus of TLS is not on the written, but on the spoken word. it is an attempt to preserve and honor the diversity of languages of large cities."</seg>
<seg id="1140">"in fact, in urban areas like Melbourne and Darwin in Australia or in Oakland in the United States, where TLS has held events since 2015, the risk that small and not quite so small languages are not passed on to the children born there."</seg>
<seg id="1141">For the makers of the project:</seg>
<seg id="1142">The mass extinction of the languages of the world can be avoided when we create cities that accept diversity - safe spaces where residents don't have to forget who they are to belong.</seg>
<seg id="1143">"while listening to it is often connected to" understanding "these events instead" listening, to appreciate, to feel. "</seg>
<seg id="1144">"in this format, history narrators first introduce and translate their story in their own language and then explain them in English."</seg>
<seg id="1145">"even if the participants are not professional storytellers, their devotion and representation will lead to the audience."</seg>
<seg id="1146">They evoke laughter and emotions as if the language is no longer a barrier.</seg>
<seg id="1147">"the following video shows, for example, a traditional story from Burkina Faso that is told in the language Dafing. during this round, the storyteller Rassidatou Konate also takes the opportunity to explain the typical customs of narrative art for her country."</seg>
<seg id="1148">"in another event, John Nyamusara tells the story of the hare and the baboon in the language Shona of Zimbabwe:"</seg>
<seg id="1149">"after explaining the meaning of his ability, John Nyamusara is asked:" how is this to speak to an audience that doesn't understand your language? "with a broad smile, he shares his sense of inclusiveness:"</seg>
<seg id="1150">You listened to it!</seg>
<seg id="1151">They were attentive...</seg>
<seg id="1152">They were with me!</seg>
<seg id="1153">"so far, the events of Treasure Language Storytelling have taken place in three cities, and the organisers hope to expand this. all who are inspired by the project can contact TLS to organize their own history stories."</seg>
<seg id="1154">Puerto Rico calls for the US re-tightening of sovereign debt</seg>
<seg id="1155">"with the aim of a re-examination of the public debt of Puerto Rico, which took place at 72 million US dollars, several religious and civil organisations took part in a mass demonstration on 3 April 2017; the march took place in the capitol of the capital, and went down to Plaza de Colón in the old town of San Juan."</seg>
<seg id="1156">It was proclaimed by the grouping "Frente Ciudadano por la Auditoría de la Deuda" (Citizens Front for the Neurorisation of Debt) and the ecumenical church meeting Puerto Ricos.</seg>
<seg id="1157">The advocates of the re-establishment of debts have also submitted a petition on the official homepage of the White House of the United States.</seg>
<seg id="1158">This is their demand:</seg>
<seg id="1159">"the people Puerto Ricos demand that politicians, bankers and government agencies responsible for the debts are responsible for their corruption."</seg>
<seg id="1160">"we call for a financial review and a Steering Committee without personal interest in public debts, with a fixed, our working conditions corresponding remuneration, which acts in favour of the economy."</seg>
<seg id="1161">We are pressed and oppressed.</seg>
<seg id="1162">The people Puerto Ricos refuses to pay a debt that is not theirs.</seg>
<seg id="1163">We will not choose between education and health.</seg>
<seg id="1164">Our retirees will not settle down with declining pension payments.</seg>
<seg id="1165">We demand immediate action.</seg>
<seg id="1166">"the island, not incorporated into the state alliance of the United States - suffers from a severe financial crisis."</seg>
<seg id="1167">"therefore, the so-called" Centre for New Economy, "a non-governmental non-profit organisation without a party affiliation with focus on socioeconomic development, proposes a law on state responsibility, as an alternative to the existing state supervision."</seg>
<seg id="1168">These are their reasons:</seg>
<seg id="1169">The economic and financial crisis of Puerto Ricos requires a large restructuring of the state infrastructure.</seg>
<seg id="1170">Measures imposed on the outside will be threatened without the participation and conviction of citizens to be rejected by the people.</seg>
<seg id="1171">The demonstration was called "Night Guard for Light and Truth."</seg>

<seg id="1187">"the book, which was published last year and is available royalty free, contains a number of articles dealing with free culture in the face of oppression."</seg>
<seg id="1188">It is a tribute to Bassel and his work.</seg>
<seg id="1189">In the introduction it is said:</seg>
<seg id="1190">"this book would like to discuss how movements for free knowledge are built, and what are the real costs associated with."</seg>
<seg id="1191">"activists, artists, designers, developers, researchers and authors, who are involved in the movement for free knowledge, have worked side by side to look beyond the fog that surrounds our newsfeeds and to create some sense of our various experiences."</seg>
<seg id="1192">"this book is an attempt to free Bassel Khartabil, the beloved and celebrated internet volunteer who has been imprisoned in Syria since March 15, 2012."</seg>
<seg id="1193">"his name was cancelled out of the directory of the Adra Prison in which he sat on October 3, 2015."</seg>
<seg id="1194">"since then, we have no information about his current state or whereabouts."</seg>
<seg id="1195">"the introductory part of his book entitled" "Collective Memory" "gives his friends and his family a voice that push for his release and who want to know him back in his normal life and freedom, instantly."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"seeing how Bassel pays a high price for his participation in a free culture has let many of us start thinking about their own destinies, actions and decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1197">Why are we here today?</seg>
<seg id="1198">What did we decide for?</seg>
<seg id="1199">What have we given up at times of extreme convictions in this process?</seg>
<seg id="1200">The web developer for open source and digital assets has been in detention for Syrian government agencies since March 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1201">"in October 2015, Bassel from the Adra prison, a non-military institution, was transferred to an unknown place."</seg>
<seg id="1202">"his wife, writer and lawyer Noura Ghazi, reported that the" military police Bassel had taken on the basis of a "strictly secret" command of the military tribunal from his cell in Adra. "</seg>
<seg id="1203">"Ghazi reported she had been contacted by people on 12 November 2015, who presented themselves as insiders of the Assad administration and informed them of an alleged death sentence against her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1204">"however, his place of residence and condition remains unknown."</seg>
<seg id="1205">"a pioneer of the Creative Commons in Syria and actively involved in projects such as Mozilla Firefox and Wikipedia, Bassel played a key role in expanding access to the Internet and knowledge for the general public in Syria."</seg>
<seg id="1206">"Barry Threw, a designer, technologist, and currently the director of New Palmyra, a project that founded Bassel, writes on pages 10 and 11 of the book:"</seg>
<seg id="1207">Perhaps none of Basque's cultural prototypes was more foresighted than the work he started with a group of archaeologists and 3D artists around 2005 to virtually reconstruct the ancient ruins of Palmyra.</seg>
<seg id="1208">"Palmyra, one of the most important archaeological sites in the world, was the crossroads of numerous civilizations. here, Greek-Roman architecture types merge with local traditions and Persian influences."</seg>
<seg id="1209">"at that time Bassel had not yet known that ten years after he began this work, the IS would make everything possible to wipe out this architecture, which embodies not only the cultural heritage of Sysriens but the world."</seg>
<seg id="1210">This move into digital archaeology and conservation has created a time capsule which will be invaluable to the public as well as for scientists and artists in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1211">"tragically, Bassel could not finish this project yet."</seg>
<seg id="1212">Noura Ghazi also contributed to the book and wrote about the passion of her husband to share his knowledge with others even during his time in prison:</seg>
<seg id="1213">"I spent my entire life to dream of freedom, and Bassel taught me to embrace her."</seg>
<seg id="1214">I am overwhelmed if I call his name.</seg>
<seg id="1215">"Bassel taught me English, even when he was already in jail."</seg>
<seg id="1216">"I learned to read, write and speak English well."</seg>
<seg id="1217">"he always shared his knowledge with everyone who asked. he taught other prisoners to read, write and speak English."</seg>
<seg id="1218">Bassel opened the door to the technology for me. he taught me to use both computers and smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="1219">He brought me the internet.</seg>
<seg id="1220">"he also taught other prisoners how they use computers, at least theoretically without actually holding them in their hands."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"Ghazi is also the author of Waiting (Waiting), a prosabbook that she wrote to her husband in 2012 until 2015 when he was in custody."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Bassel and Noura have worked together in the book for one year.</seg>
<seg id="1223">She smuggled the texts to him when she visited him and he translated them from Arabic into English.</seg>
<seg id="1224">The book is available royalty-free.</seg>
<seg id="1225">Book envelope by Youssef Abdalki.</seg>
<seg id="1226">The book is dedicated to the public domain.</seg>
<seg id="1227">Here is an excerpt from the book of Nora entitled "It is happening":</seg>
<seg id="1228">"it happens during each visit,"</seg>
<seg id="1229">"that I sink in the world of your enchanting eyes,"</seg>
<seg id="1230">"that I lose the contemplation in the moment we embrace,"</seg>
<seg id="1231">"that I don't care about any of the dangers,"</seg>
<seg id="1232">"each of the fences, shackles and guards"</seg>
<seg id="1233">I forget the throng of the prison</seg>
<seg id="1234">And I enter every detail of your voice and words</seg>
<seg id="1235">"when I am in love with me,"</seg>
<seg id="1236">When your eyes say goodbye</seg>
<seg id="1237">And I will leave another piece of my soul with you...</seg>
<seg id="1238">"I quickly return to my loneliness,"</seg>
<seg id="1239">"to get back all the moments,"</seg>
<seg id="1240">And to weep and smile about your absence.</seg>
<seg id="1241">I testify to myself that I will return soon...</seg>
<seg id="1242">"on the first anniversary of the incarceration of Bassel, Ghazi wrote:"</seg>
<seg id="1243">"one year passes, my soul"</seg>

<seg id="1248">"since the beginning of protests in 2011 against the Bashar al-Assad regime, more than 65,000 people have disappeared under the Syrian Network for Human Rights (Syrian Network for Human Rights)."</seg>
<seg id="1249">Those arrested or disappeared under force by the regime were tortured or even executed.</seg>
<seg id="1250">"until 2016, according to the international human rights organisation Amnesty International, at least 17.723 Syrians have died in detention."</seg>
<seg id="1251">The stories of many other people remain unknown.</seg>
<seg id="1252">The Global Voices Community has been calling for the release of Bassel since 2012.</seg>
<seg id="1253">We repeat our call today in the hope we have to do this for the last time.</seg>
<seg id="1254">"Mosambique: due to corruption, the director resigned after release on previous post."</seg>
<seg id="1255">"Mozambique reacted with anger to a corruption case in which a government member returned to work in the state machine after half of his sentence, in which corruption was committed."</seg>
<seg id="1256">"this is Diodino Cambaza, who was arrested in 2008 and sentenced to 22 years imprisonment in 2010, together with four other defendants."</seg>
<seg id="1257">"the money came from public funds of Mozambique airports, whose advice was Cambaza between 2005 and 2008."</seg>
<seg id="1258">"Cambaza was released in 2016 for good guidance and immediately called for his re-adjustment to the company, which took place on April 19."</seg>
<seg id="1259">"in accordance with a statement issued by the Attorney General of the Republic that rejected the request, there would be no obstacle to Cambaza to return to his old post, since the company did not undergo disciplinary proceedings following his detention."</seg>
<seg id="1260">"however, many inhabitants do not mean the action good."</seg>
<seg id="1261">"in an interview with the Deutsche Welle, the Centre for Public Integrity (Centro de Integridade Pública, short CIP), condemned the decision of the company to re-establish the director in an interview with the Deutsche Welle:"</seg>
<seg id="1262">"represents a setback in the fight against corruption and highlights the lack of transparency and is even a backward step towards the efforts of our legal system, such as the CIP."</seg>
<seg id="1263">What we are aware of is that the company should also have directed a disciplinary procedure against the contrary.</seg>
<seg id="1264">"however, the company apparently remained silent and did not make reasonable legal steps for the application of the corresponding functions."</seg>
<seg id="1265">"Egídio Vaz, a major voice in the Mozambican social media, also rejects this behaviour and considers the case as" "disproved" ":"</seg>
<seg id="1266">"if Cambaza would be a competent guy, he would be a consultant, after he was sentenced to a prison sentence and half of which had been cut off."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"he could give paid lectures and motivating speeches, he could advise and polish his image."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"but since he is incompetent, he agreed to be integrated into the company, which he helped to inflict harm."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"consequently, it is obvious that Cambaza is gladly paid for his silence."</seg>
<seg id="1270">Disgusting!</seg>
<seg id="1271">"bitone Viage, young Mosambican and student of political science in Brazil says, the director has no moral:"</seg>
<seg id="1272">"Cambaza is rewarded by the state because he insults him, I cannot believe that someone is rewarded in such a way that has already massively offended the state."</seg>
<seg id="1273">"Cambaza lacks morale and to serve the state, * he had already had a unique opportunity to serve the state, but instead served itself only in the state."</seg>
<seg id="1274">Cambaza used the state as though it was an inexhaustible source of money and the state itself became tired of this man who was summoned and finally sentenced to a long prison term.</seg>
<seg id="1275">"honestly, I don't know why this man was so rewarded."</seg>
<seg id="1276">"Francey Zeút prefers to remind the Prime Minister of Mozambique, Samora Machel, to remind that a thief is in prison:"</seg>
<seg id="1277">"thieves belong to the prison of Samora and will not only be remembered as the first independent president, but also as sharp, single-edged and - by the way - prophetic speaker."</seg>
<seg id="1278">"one of his most famous oral representations, when he vigorously confirmed that" an ambitious person was capable of everything, also fatherland for his ambitions, his own individual interest, to sell. "</seg>
<seg id="1279">"Samora also said," I don't know if an ambitious man changes, my experience shows that it's not that way. he changes the tactics, but he doesn't turn away from his ambitions. "</seg>
<seg id="1280">An ambitious person is at the same time criminal. "</seg>

<seg id="1286">Facebook blocks the racist word "Kalar" in Myanmar and censored many users</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Burmese word "Kalar pae" means chickpeas or sparse.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"photo by Sanjay Acharya, Wikipedia Commons, Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 Unported"</seg>
<seg id="1289">"according to Facebook users in Myanmar, the known social network took their posts from the network because they contained the word 'Kalar'."</seg>
<seg id="1290">"although the origin of the word is still discussed, it is usually used to refer to people of East Indian origin or generally used as an adjective" "Indian". ""</seg>
<seg id="1291">"Facebook censored the word" "Kalar" "or" "mirage" "(in Burmese script) as part of an initiative to address the widespread problem of hate speech in Burma in the social network."</seg>
<seg id="1292">"in recent years, the rise of radical nationalist movements has given the word an extremely derogatory connotation."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"in particular, it is a word that is mostly used by ultra-nationalists as hate speech against Muslims, representing a minority of the population in Myanmar."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"but in an effort to combat hate speech in Myanmar, the company has censored a lot of meaningful content on its platform."</seg>
<seg id="1295">"today, Kalar may normally be associated with racism, but the word in itself does not automatically call hate speech."</seg>
<seg id="1296">"the context is important & # 8212; many people have reported that even posts, in which they have discussed the use of the word, have been censored for their use."</seg>
<seg id="1297">"moreover, there are several Burmese words with basic meanings that have the same letter sequence as' Kalar '."</seg>
<seg id="1298">"for example, chair is written on Burmese also 'Kalar htaing', which contains the same letters as well as other words like 'Kalar pae', 'Kalar OAT' (camel) or 'kalarkaar' (curtain)."</seg>
<seg id="1299">The Faceboocrite Aung Kaung Myat explained the different meanings of words with the sound of 'Kalar' so:</seg>
<seg id="1300">A mail from one of my friends was deleted today because he contained the word Kalar.</seg>
<seg id="1301">"however, he had asked his friends in a witty way whether they knew how to alleviate his back pain by making a pun."</seg>
<seg id="1302">"the phrase ku la -" healing "(ku) + the questionword (la) in Burmese - resembles the racist expression, but the context is completely different."</seg>
<seg id="1303">There were different reactions to Facebook's initiative.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"Zin Win Htet is the opinion that it will lessen the hate speech of radical nationalists, but also stressed that Facebook must be analytical before all poisons that are suspected of spreading racism."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Facebook does not delete the word "Kalar" manually.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It filters the word automatically.</seg>
<seg id="1307">Automation will not understand what you are writing on faceook.</seg>
<seg id="1308">What it should do instead is to carefully analyze the post and check it by checking the adjacent words.</seg>
<seg id="1309">"for example," Kalar Htine "(chair) and" Kalar pae "(splitting)."</seg>
<seg id="1310">"the good thing is that these dirty nationalists, who spread hate speech, get a pretty good lesson."</seg>
<seg id="1311">Now it is time to circumcise their nationalism.</seg>
<seg id="1312">"while the action may send a strong signal to all that propagate hate speech, the efficiency of this strategy may not persist long."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"the experiences of social networks in China like Sina Weibo and WeChat have shown that the censorship of keywords often becomes a cat and mouse game, whereby the users of social networks simply begin to use a new word or alternative spelling of the censored word to express their views."</seg>
<seg id="1314">"the author Aung Kaung Myat described how Facebook started to delete his posts, when he only wanted to tell his friends that the word 'Kalar' was banished from the social network:"</seg>
<seg id="1315">"when I became aware of this new policy of Facebook, I made a post to tell my Facebook friends that the word is locked."</seg>
<seg id="1316">"ironically, my mail was removed from Facebook and I was prohibited from posting, posting and sharing content for 24 hours, because the mail" didn't meet the Facebook Community standards. ""</seg>
<seg id="1317">Facebook has removed a variety of posts from people who have no negative intentions or who simply try to show their opinions against the hate speech of radical nationalists.</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Patrick Murphy wrote that his post was removed, which has nothing to do with hate speech:"</seg>
<seg id="1319">Post without hate speech from Facebook.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"in the post, the author shared his opinion on why extreme nationalism and religious fundamentalism in the country are bad."</seg>
<seg id="1321">"Chan Myae Khine believes that Facebook should have done more before the start of the initiative, for example the Burmese Internet community asking for advice:"</seg>
<seg id="1322">"Facebook likes a benevolent intent to lessen racism in Burma through its platform, but it does not work."</seg>
<seg id="1323">Censoring such words will only bring more hatred within the different communities.</seg>
<seg id="1324">"in addition, it seems as if they have started this without a local context or technical support and have forbidden such words like" "chair" "or" "pea curry". ""</seg>
<seg id="1325">"even when they found out that they made mistakes, they did not try to correct the wrongly deleted posts."</seg>
<seg id="1326">"if they had only slightly more respect for the 15 million benefits, which would give them a large turnover, that would be great."</seg>
<seg id="1327">Facebook automatic censorship has caused a lot of ridicule among users.</seg>
<seg id="1328">"instead of taking it seriously, users now make fun of Facebook and consciously write the word 'Kalar' not in the context of hate speech to see if their posts are taken from the net."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"here you can see some screenshots of Facebook posts, which contained no hate speech but were still removed:"</seg>
<seg id="1330">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1331">The Burmese text reads: "I want to sit on a chair and eat peas curry and watch an Indian movie.</seg>
<seg id="1332">"just to try out if Facebook removes the mail, which contains the word Kalar."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1334">"the post says" "If you are a doctor, do you heal people?"</seg>
<seg id="1335">"screenshot, used with permission."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"in the last five years, extreme nationalist ideologies and religious fundamentalists who have used social networks to expand their voices and influence have increased."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"among other things, hate speech in social networks is meant to incite violence in the communities of Myanmar, especially in the area of Rakhine, where conflicts between Muslims and Buddhists have forced thousands to flee."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"Facebook was criticized for its failure to bring out the balancing hate speech on its Burmese sites, criticising it."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"but instead of censoring the word 'Kalar', it would have been better to look at the context rather than code-focused initiatives and learned from them."</seg>

<seg id="1345">"at that time, brother Harrypersad Maharaj, the leader of the Interreligious Organization (IRO), a group that representatives of the various religious groups of the country gathers that the state should not interfere, since that, age does not determine the maturity."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"despite the fact that Trinidad and Tobago is a contractual partner of the United Nations Children's Rights Convention, the minors are defined as" every person under the age of 18. ""</seg>
<seg id="1347">"the UN stats for the years 2002-2012 show that the share of children, which were married to 15, was 2.8 percent in Trinidad and Tobago, and at 18 it was 8.1 percent."</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in 2011, the country's statistical central office confirmed that more than 8400 girls and 1,300 boys were married under 19 in 1997-2007."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"online petitions and social media movements, which were striving to abolish laws for child marriage, followed at the foot and enjoyed great support."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"nevertheless, not everything went smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="1351">"a Hindu leader, for example, had no qualms about telling the critics of the children woe, they were supposed to take care of their own affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1352">"this kind of religious opposition caused tensions in this uncomplicated matter, and at some point, doubts arose whether the opposition would agree to the bill at all."</seg>
<seg id="1353">"but at the beginning of 2017, the bill was decided against the child before - despite 4 senators (including a woman) of the opposition and an independent who held it - so that he could be debated in the House of Representatives, where a simple majority would make him the law."</seg>
<seg id="1354">Now only the President of the country has to agree and declare the law.</seg>
<seg id="1355">One of the country's Senators announced on Facebook a status update which Leslie-Ann Boiselle posted on Instagram:</seg>
<seg id="1356">Mr. Senator Clarence Rambharat: the bill against child marriage was voted in the House of Representatives with 35 votes and no one decided against it.</seg>
<seg id="1357">"after it has previously been approved by the Senate, the draft can now become a law."</seg>
<seg id="1358">"the majority of social media users were thrilled, because the laws were finally changed for children."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"Facebook member Lovell Francis, who suffers from a ministerial ministry in the Ministry of Education, said:"</seg>

<seg id="1379">"dear Sat, if we, rather than discussing the debate so general, in a way that can only provoke panic and arrogance, we would simply say that the state, our daughters, protects them from being abused by large, hard-boiled men that are beneficial to them," would you then be ready to continue the discussion?

<seg id="1391">"the Wikipedia page was presented on January 18, 2012, contrary to the SOPA (Stop Online Privacy Act) and PIPA copyright legislation in the USA, internationally obscured."</seg>
<seg id="1392">Created by Wikipedia (CC BY-SA 3.0)</seg>
<seg id="1393">"for more than a month now, Turkey has been blocking the popular and crowdsourcing principle of encyclopedia Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1394">Day by day it becomes clear how important the platform for users is to find and share helpful and reliable information.</seg>
<seg id="1395">Both students and reporters and fans of TV series defend themselves against the blockade.</seg>
<seg id="1396">"although many tech-versed Internet users are used to use circumscribing tools for blocked websites (a recent article from the New York Times reports that Turkey has the third largest VPN prevalence), most ordinary Wikipedia users do not fall into this category."</seg>
<seg id="1397">"although Turkey has been blocking articles from Wikipedia since 2008, as described recently in a published report by Berkman Klein Center for Internet & amp; Society at Harvard University, regular blockages of the Internet have been held since 2007 after the Internet Act (No. 5651) was adopted."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"according to China, Turkey is the second most known country in the world when it comes to the massive censorship of Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"while the platform remains closed, there are now several folders (pages that mirror the contents of Wikipedia and are often updated)."</seg>
<seg id="1400">"a solution came from IPFS (the InterPlanetary File System), when the platform depended on all Turkish wikipedia sites on its decentralized Peer-to-Peer network, which is not based on the system of domain names and thus makes a complete censorship difficult."</seg>
<seg id="1401">"in spite of legal prohibition, the content is available."</seg>
<seg id="1402">"in a blog post, IPFS reports about his efforts:"</seg>
<seg id="1403">"after hearing the news (about the blocking of Wikipedia), we put it all in putting snapshots from Wikipedia to the IPFS platform. so there is the possibility to read the content in a decentralized and distributed manner."</seg>
<seg id="1404">"this can help users to view at least all Wikipedia content, even if they cannot reach the website www.wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1405">"IPFS also indicated that this step was done independently of the Wikimedia-Foundation, and it is just about screenshots and no live or dynamic versions of the website."</seg>
<seg id="1406">"however, Wikimedia was involved in other efforts to circumvent the lock."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Cristian Consonni from Wikimedia Italy has produced both tr.vikiansiklopedia..org, a Mirrorpage from Wikipedia, as well as WikiMirror, an open source project that everyone can use to host similar mirrors when locked in the respective country Wikipedia."</seg>
<seg id="1408">Consonni told Subhashish Panigrahi - Global Voices member and staff at Mozilla in the Panigrahi's Open Speaks podcast:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"it is not a complete copy of a proxy address, a mirror."</seg>
<seg id="1410">One attacks on another URL that is not the original. that which one sees then is from Wikipedia.</seg>
<seg id="1411">"essentially, the server redirects the request to the correct Wikipedia page, so it is possible to see the contents of Wikipedia itself if they are locked in Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="1412">This is done by a server not in Turkey.</seg>

<seg id="1414">"a suhlring Nashorn, Chitwan."</seg>
<seg id="1415">Photo by Sagar Giri.</seg>
<seg id="1416">With permission used.</seg>
<seg id="1417">Sagar Giri was never satisfied with the photos he saw around him. they were blurred with poorly positioned motives and balanced colours.</seg>
<seg id="1418">The motivated him to carry a camera and try to straighten the situation.</seg>
<seg id="1419">Back then he was still a child.</seg>
<seg id="1420">"today, at the age of 28, Sagar strives to bring Neptune to the international stage."</seg>
<seg id="1421">"and his hometown, next to the Chitwan National Park, offers him the perfect opportunity to shoot photos that draw attention to Neptune's wildlife."</seg>
<seg id="1422">He described on Facebook how he helps him in his work:</seg>
<seg id="1423">"I live at the edge of Chitwan National Park, a world natural heritage. what could be better for a passionate wildlife photographer!!"</seg>
<seg id="1424">I just rested at home when suddenly Navarre (the manager of Chitwan Gaida lodge) called me. he had received a call from my father that on the banks of the Rapti river a leopard would be.</seg>
<seg id="1425">The river dam is only a few minutes away from the tourist town of Sauraha.</seg>
<seg id="1426">Immediately I started with my camera and was there in a few minutes.</seg>
<seg id="1427">"my father observed it and showed me the place on the other side of the river, where the leopard was located and I immediately began to gnash pictures!!"</seg>
<seg id="1428">Sagar strives to cooperate with the authorities to gain worldwide recognition for Neptune's nature and would like to deepen the understanding that wild animals are not as frightening as they look.</seg>
<seg id="1429">"and he should know it, for he stood afar off to tigers:"</seg>
<seg id="1430">A tiger can not be disturbed by the opinion of the sheep during sleep!!</seg>
<seg id="1431">Late in the evening. the light is too weak.</seg>
<seg id="1432">Sleeping time for all animals and birds.</seg>
<seg id="1433">"also I was on the way home because of the darkness when suddenly the king of the sword appeared. he immediately sat down, we look at him and he stares me through the Sal-trees!!"</seg>
<seg id="1434">"to promote the protection of wild animals, Sagar places the logo" "I click for conservation" "(lit.: I click for environmental protection) on its photos."</seg>
<seg id="1435">But his passion for the promotion of Neptune's nature and wildlife is not always easy.</seg>
<seg id="1436">He waited 22 days long and usually lived in a tent to take photographs of Otters at the Bardia National Park. up to 12 days it took until he could photograph a tiger and six to seven days for the perfect photo of birds living near the tourist accommodations.</seg>

<seg id="1465">"years after the wedding, Indian women dared to pronounce the name of their husbands for the first time."</seg>

<seg id="1469">"this entry was written by Kayonaaz Kalyproseca and was originally published on video Volunteers, an award-winning international media organisation from India."</seg>
<seg id="1470">A revised version was published here as part of a content sharing agreement.</seg>
<seg id="1471">"in many parts of India, it is important to avoid women with the greatest care to pronounce the names of their husbands or even older men in the family."</seg>
<seg id="1472">"instead, they use a pronoun or say" "father of my child." ""</seg>
<seg id="1473">"from Chhattisgarh to Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, women admit that due to social pressure they respect the husband, as well as fear of consequences, they should disregard the norm, get this practice alive."</seg>
<seg id="1474">Last year Malati Mahatoto was convicted of the Indian state of Odisha and was expelled by her family and community after she had met a married relative with her name.</seg>
<seg id="1475">"the tradition of their wives also does not mention the name, is also common among men. however, they have far less rebukes to fear, if at all, they should not follow this practice."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"in the small village of Walhe in the Pune district, in Maharashtra, nine women, including health workers and housewives, entered a unique club and quickly became the main theme of the city."</seg>
<seg id="1477">It is a place only for them alone where they can discuss and discuss the intricacies of the patriarchy.</seg>
<seg id="1478">"as one of 56 clubs in 13 Indian states, it is part of the # KhelBadal campaign run by the community of video Volunteers and campaigning for the dismantling of the Patriarchate."</seg>
<seg id="1479">"Rohini Paine has been working for seven years with the help of her video camera to cover practices such as children's marriage to the exile of HIV- and AIDS-infected, and leads this club."</seg>
<seg id="1480">She reports how these clubs have created a safe place for these women and at the same time made them ambassadors of change.</seg>
<seg id="1481">The first video that Rohini showed in their discussion was women who did not call their husbands by name.</seg>
<seg id="1482">She chose this subject because she wanted to open the conversation about the Patriarchate with a problem with which the women could easily identify themselves.</seg>
<seg id="1483">"not to pronounce the name of their husbands out loud, is a custom which they all have to maintain and never questioned."</seg>
<seg id="1484">Rohini means:</seg>
<seg id="1485">This tradition testifies that a woman respects her husband and wishes him a long life.</seg>
<seg id="1486">A woman who does not consider this is considered deceitful as a woman without morality.</seg>
<seg id="1487">Tradition is so deeply rooted that we have never thought about it until this discussion.</seg>
<seg id="1488">"at the beginning, Rohini, who had never called her husband by name, wanted to try out at home, as it is going on."</seg>
<seg id="1489">She showed the video of the discussion on her husband and her mother-in-law.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1491">My mother-in-law and my husband remained silent for a long time after the video was over.</seg>
<seg id="1492">"practice, my husband, turned to me and said that I should call him by now on his name."</seg>
<seg id="1493">With this self-confidence in luggage Rohini launched its first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"many women had never heard the word" patriarchate "before. some believed that it was a good thing, because it meant that the younger members of a family, especially girls and women, would be protected."</seg>
<seg id="1495">"at the beginning of the round, Rohini showed a video about the problem in Uttar Pradesh."</seg>
<seg id="1496">"after the video projection, the women tried to start the discussion with an exercise."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"Rohini asked each participant to say the name of her husband with different feelings - happy, angry, sad, loving and so on."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"then she asked all," "If we cannot tell the name of our husbands, but they can call us how they want, does this mean that they do not respect us?"</seg>
<seg id="1499">Should it not be equivalent? "</seg>
<seg id="1500">"some of these women have been married for 30 years and this was the first day they gave the name of their husbands on their lips," says Rohini Paz of the village Walhe in Maharashtra about the breaking of a centuries-old tradition where married women never have the name of their husbands. "</seg>
<seg id="1501">Rohini recounts:</seg>
<seg id="1502">A woman was so shy that she was only giggling before her during the whole exercise; another decided to leave the entire frustration against him and his family by cursing him.</seg>
<seg id="1503">The expression on their faces was ecstatic.</seg>
<seg id="1504">I think I will never forget it again.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"still in the rush of adrenaline, having broken with an ancient custom, the women decided they would actually try to call their husbands by name."</seg>
<seg id="1506">And they kept their word.</seg>
<seg id="1507">"in the coming days, Rohini received a large number of reports."</seg>
<seg id="1508">The husband of a woman called Rohini and asked what ideas she put in her head: his wife couldn't stop saying his name.</seg>
<seg id="1509">Another club member decided to do it during dinner before the whole family.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"when her mother-in-law stared her, she was afraid and said that it was a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"another woman said," "Rohini thought I should do it."</seg>
<seg id="1512">A husband of a participant was less understanding and the situation arose in force.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"Rohini reports how women have tried to stop other practices, such as wearing the tine-red dot on the forehead, which indicates the marital status:"</seg>
<seg id="1514">Why do women only need to show that they are married?</seg>
<seg id="1515">"I said to my husband, that I would wear the petrol-red dot if he did it too."</seg>
<seg id="1516">He laughed only and I stopped wearing it.</seg>
<seg id="1517">"the other women have not completely stopped working, but think they are now in a better position to choose not to wear it on some days."</seg>
<seg id="1518">"for many women, the discussion club is a safe place where they can exchange their opinions and goals."</seg>
<seg id="1519">"" "we take a trip at each discus club."</seg>
<seg id="1520">Normally we pack lunch and water and go out to the field.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"I don't want women to take care of who could hear what they hear," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="1522">In the last months they celebrated their own birthdays with cakes for the first time in their life; they danced and sang and talked about things they had never thought before.</seg>
<seg id="1523">Rohini says:</seg>
<seg id="1524">"I have been working on these problems for so many years and yet I have never talked about some things, for example like our identities to our husbands."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"it feels great to be able to say certain things, no matter how small they occur."</seg>
<seg id="1526">"in a panel discussion, we talked about the concept of honour and how it is connected to clothes."</seg>
<seg id="1527">Some women in the group have only been wearing saris since their marriage.</seg>
<seg id="1528">"for most it's okay, but some wanted a sage buddy, wearing a wide shirt over a pair of pants, they didn't dare."</seg>
<seg id="1529">"after much controversy and discussion about the advantages of their own choice of clothes, morality combined with the Saris and much more, Rohini smuggled their own couple of Kurtas (upper shirts) into a discussion board so that the women could wear them."</seg>
<seg id="1530">"next, they decided to take a trip to Goa where they can wear jeans and Rohini is sure they will succeed."</seg>
<seg id="1531">Rohini confirms that things are slowly rolling in the five months since their first discussion club.</seg>
<seg id="1532">So far we have only done small steps.</seg>
<seg id="1533">"some women tried it a few times, but then stopped telling the name of her husband."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"some, including me, do it yet, but only if they are alone and no other family members are there."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Only one or two women continue to say the names of their husbands; only one or two women now wear Zinnoberrot on their forehead.</seg>
<seg id="1536">Women in the discussion club know that the changes they wish to achieve in their lives - like the haggling for more freedom of movement or the own coat of clothes - are at the end of a difficult to navigate river.</seg>
<seg id="1537">"by giving each other self-confidence, they are aware that they are sitting in the same boat."</seg>
<seg id="1538">How Rohini explains:</seg>
<seg id="1539">Each of us is a victim of the Patriarchate.</seg>
<seg id="1540">I am also.</seg>
<seg id="1541">But this club gives each one of us the confidence that something will change.</seg>
<seg id="1542">And I know that it is not limited to 30 families. there will be a chain reaction when every woman goes home in the club and tells other people about what we are talking about and what we are doing.</seg>
<seg id="1543">We are all in the same boat.</seg>
<seg id="1544">The correspondents of the Video Volunteers Community come from marginalized groups in India and make videos about stories that are not reported.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"these stories are" news of those who experience it, "and offer a hyperlocal context to report global human rights and development challenges."</seg>

<seg id="1585">"a new system of kidnapping of smuggled individuals for organ trafficking, probably for disbelieving purposes, worries the police of Zambézia, a province in Mozambique. the local government now called for a series of operations to stop the practice."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"at the beginning of the month, three men were killed in the district of Milange, a few kilometres from the border to Malawi."</seg>
<seg id="1587">One of the victims was beheaded and some of the organs were taken.</seg>
<seg id="1588">Two men were arrested and subsequently admitted that the organs of shamans in Tanzania and Malawi were used.</seg>
<seg id="1589">"there is the local superstition that the head of a bald man can reveal gold or bring wealth, the police spokesman of Zambézia of the BBC declared."</seg>
<seg id="1590">It is the first time that successive attacks on smuggled men were registered in Mozambique.</seg>
<seg id="1591">"another group, the goal of assassinations for obscure purposes, is people with albinism."</seg>
<seg id="1592">This led to the fact that the UN 2016 in the South African country conducted a mission to investigate this practice.</seg>
<seg id="1593">"persecution of people with albinism is common in other countries of southern Africa, especially in neighbouring Tanzania, where the government developed campaigns to combat this superstition and prejudice."</seg>

<seg id="1600">"the persecution and murder of smuggled individuals for the extraction and sale of their organs in the district of Morrumbala, Province of Zambézia, has given cultural motives and is commissioned by the traditional shamans (PRM), which also indicates that a belief existed, according to which the victims in the head had power, generating wealth."</seg>
<seg id="1601">"in recent days, three men with hair loss problems have been murdered in this part of the country."</seg>

<seg id="1628">The following version will be published as part of a partnership agreement via Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="1629">The case of the imprisoned Chinese dissidents Liu Xiaobo has attracted attention in the international community after his lawyer had announced at the end of June that he was hospitalized for liver cancer in the final stage.</seg>
<seg id="1630">"in 2009, Liu was sentenced to eleven years imprisonment for" Subversion "(State endangerment) after having participated in the draft Charter 08, a manifesto calling for democratic reforms in China."</seg>
<seg id="1631">He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his work in 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1632">The State Department in China referred to Lius as an "an internal affair" and told a spokesman that he considered it "not necessary to discuss this matter with any other country."</seg>
<seg id="1633">"nevertheless, China continues to receive calls from the international community, Nobel laureate and his wife, poet Liu Xia, or to allow him treatment abroad."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"while some countries have criticized the severe treatment of the couple in Beijing, others are completely wiped out on the subject."</seg>

<seg id="1637">"Zeid Ra-ad al-Hussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, met Chinese officials at the end of June to discuss the case of Liu."</seg>
<seg id="1638">"however, a spokesman refused to comment on whether the United Nations should exercise pressure to allow Liu abroad to be treated."</seg>
<seg id="1639">Norway and Norway</seg>
<seg id="1640">Norway's Prime Minister Erna Solberg and Foreign Minister Børge Brende refused to answer questions about Lius release.</seg>
<seg id="1641">"the relationship between China and Norway came to an end after the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to Liu in 2010, although the Norwegian government announced that this was ultimately nothing to do with the decision."</seg>
<seg id="1642">Diplomatic relations continued until December last year. only in June Norway signed an agreement to resume salmon exports to China because exports have been largely blocked since 2010.</seg>
<seg id="1643">"after the news spread that Liu was seriously ill, the Nobel Committee expressed his hope for unconditional release and invited Liu to pick up his prize in Oslo."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"due to his imprisonment, he was unable to accept his prize."</seg>

<seg id="1653">"a spokeswoman of the US embassy in China, Mary Beth Polley, announced that the message agency AFP announced on June 27 that the embassy asks the Chinese authorities not only to release Liu, but also to free his wife Liu Xia from house arrest."</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the request of the US embassy drew an angry response from China, with the statement by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs that" "no country has the right to interfere and to make irresponsible remarks on Chinese internal affairs."</seg>
<seg id="1655">Polley announced that China should offer the couple the following:</seg>

<seg id="1683">Is Singapore a city or country?</seg>
<seg id="1684">The question may seem stupid as Singapore is recognised as an independent state internationally.</seg>
<seg id="1685">"but according to the Minister of Justice K. Shanmugam, Singapore should be regarded as a city."</seg>
<seg id="1686">This remark triggered a debate in the blogosphere.</seg>
<seg id="1687">During the meeting on the occasion of a meeting of the international branch of the New York Bar Association the Minister noted that many people criticized the dominance of Singapore's only political party because they compared Singapore with other countries.</seg>
<seg id="1688">He supported Singapore to be regarded as a city.</seg>
<seg id="1689">... no one questioned whether New York is a democracy...</seg>
<seg id="1690">This is where most people commit a mistake.</seg>
<seg id="1691">I have tried to explain that we are different.</seg>
<seg id="1692">We are a city.</seg>
<seg id="1693">We are not a country.</seg>
<seg id="1694">"the blog Cavalierio accused the Minister of Justice to" "twist the logic" "to defend the existing authoritarian exercise of power in Singapore."</seg>
<seg id="1695">"and then, after all our efforts and sacrifices to create this precious land, one hears that we are ultimately not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1696">"it sounded so vulgar, it had the appearance of an escape from the responsibilities, a breach of duty."</seg>
<seg id="1697">"Singapore, if you are not my country, whose country is it then?"</seg>
<seg id="1698">"the reasons cited by Shanmugam were not very noble: he defended an idea, according to which one could not measure the political system of Singapore with other 'normal countries', in the face of that, he seemed invariably undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"on the other hand, he defended the idea that Singapore should be compared to cities such as Chicago, San Francisco or New York, equally cities which are permanently routed by a party."</seg>
<seg id="1700">These cities are democratic.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"once you reach the heart of the subject, the good old corpse appears again by the authoritarian rulers who pretend to be democrats, leaving the twisted logic because it fits better to their power."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"in the end, the last week of Shanmugam was given answers to his American guests regarding our press, our judiciary, our political system, really non-replies."</seg>
<seg id="1703">He asked questions in a rational way with non-answers.</seg>
<seg id="1704">"Rachel Zeng urges Shanmugam to clarify his opinion, because she did not understand this conclusion."</seg>
<seg id="1705">I personally find it a bit difficult to swallow.</seg>
<seg id="1706">"if Singapore is not a country, but a city, so to which country belongs our city..."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"in short, I don't understand anything."</seg>
<seg id="1708">I would be very grateful if our dear K Shanmugam would take the trouble to clarify this point as long as he was paid highly to be part of the government of the city of Singapore.</seg>
<seg id="1709">"by publishing his comment on the blog, he points to the critics that you should start reading the entire manuscript of the conference so that you can better understand the context of Shanmugam's statements, according to which Singapore is a city and not a country."</seg>
<seg id="1710">Read the transcript.</seg>
<seg id="1711">"when he said Singapore was rather a" city "than a country," he explained why the Singapore elections were so unequal, even if we enjoy free and just elections. "</seg>
<seg id="1712">He compared Singapore with cities in the USA (and how many of these cities saw a party for decades?).</seg>
<seg id="1713">"when he said that Singapore is not a country, he obviously did not mean it in this sense!"</seg>
<seg id="1714">"Clement Tan shows his disappointment about Shanmugam, who is a leader of a growing generation, making such a polemical statement."</seg>
<seg id="1715">"I am very embarrassed about what the Minister of Justice of Singapore said, very embarrassed..."</seg>
<seg id="1716">"at least I knew with Lee Kuan Yew and the members of the old guard, what I expected - whether I agree with them or not, but that's another thing."</seg>
<seg id="1717">"but with K. Shanmugam, a member of the new generation of the political leaders of Singapore, I have doubts and I am not even sure if he really believes it is right and aware of what he defends."</seg>
<seg id="1718">The TEMASEK review discovers the weaknesses of Shanmugams's arguments:</seg>
<seg id="1719">"did Mr. Shanmugam" "bad faith" "committed a mistake or was it a Freudian spokesman?"</seg>
<seg id="1720">"if Singapore is not a country, we are only considered as an independent and sovereign state?"</seg>
<seg id="1721">"if not, what country do the sovereign rights of Singapore go back?"</seg>
<seg id="1722">Singapore is unique; it is equally land and city.</seg>
<seg id="1723">"as he plays an important role within the government cabinet, the statements of Mr. Shanmugam are of serious significance."</seg>
<seg id="1724">"why do the people of Singapore do their military service, do they only defend their city but not their country?"</seg>
<seg id="1725">Who must pay back our Prime Minister Bill?</seg>
<seg id="1726">What is the value of our staff?</seg>
<seg id="1727">Are we the citizens of a country or the inhabitants of a city?</seg>
<seg id="1728">"through Journey of a Decade to Bejahung, Singapore, the magazine Journey of a Decade has always been a city:"</seg>
<seg id="1729">I did not say what I said...</seg>
<seg id="1730">This sentence seems to have annoyed many people of Singapore...</seg>
<seg id="1731">Nobody ever said Singapore is a country.</seg>
<seg id="1732">We were always a city.</seg>
<seg id="1733">We have always been a city / island state.</seg>
<seg id="1734">"I can understand that we often hear statements like" the defense of the country, especially "etc., but that is not quite right."</seg>

<seg id="1741">"the latest part of this series comes from Nevin Thompson, Editor for Global Voices, Japan, who lives in Canada and Japan."</seg>
<seg id="1742">The question I am most asked in Japan is: "are you Americans?"</seg>
<seg id="1743">"no, I'm sorry," I'll answer. "I'm from Canada." since 1994 I have lived there and again in Japan. "</seg>
<seg id="1744">"depending on the situation the conversation takes place, it is considered politely to show interest in his interlocutor by asking personal questions."</seg>
<seg id="1745">"my clarification then follows mostly the standard answer:" Oh, Rocky Mountains, Ice Hockey, Nature. "many Canadians cook perhaps inwardly in anger if they are held for Americans, but that doesn't bother me."</seg>
<seg id="1746">"for someone who doesn't know himself, there is little that distinguishes us Canadians from Americans."</seg>
<seg id="1747">This is one of the reasons why so many Canadians get a Canadian flag well visible in their backpack when they travel.</seg>
<seg id="1748">All love Canadians.</seg>
<seg id="1749">Americans on the other hand....</seg>
<seg id="1750">"so it was already when I began to travel through the world 20 years ago - before Donald Trump, before the invasion of Iraq and before September 11."</seg>

<seg id="1765">With Adam from San Francisco.</seg>
<seg id="1766">Or with Michael from Honolulu.</seg>
<seg id="1767">But there are also some problems with the stamp "nice."</seg>
<seg id="1768">"first, being called" nice, "is basically to be spiny - like the good-natured, gentle but tragically insignificant figure Ned Flanders from" The Simpsons "(who has its own Canadian Doppelgänger)."</seg>
<seg id="1769">"if Canada really is a nation full of people like Ned Flanders, this would indeed be a step forward. but the real problem is that" nice "has no personality."</seg>
<seg id="1770">"there are no corners and edges, nothing you can encounter."</seg>
<seg id="1771">Being harmless means to be unobtrusive and uninteresting and to earn no attention.</seg>
<seg id="1772">"this can be a good thing if you want to stay unnoticed in the background, away from the things that happen around you."</seg>
<seg id="1773">"even so far, I would say that the desire to be free and alone is a main property of the Canadian."</seg>
<seg id="1774">We tend to take care of our own affairs only.</seg>
<seg id="1775">What outsiders call "nice" is perhaps just cool courtesy.</seg>
<seg id="1776">Canadians do not often talk about the fence with their neighbours.</seg>
<seg id="1777">"we lack the warm, open friendliness that I now connect with my American friends."</seg>

<seg id="1895">"Concepción González Ramírez leads a small hotel in Tapachula, in the state of Chiapas, at the border of Mexico to Guatemala."</seg>

<seg id="1898">"on the way of migrants crossing Europe or Latin America, certain places are known for their hospitality."</seg>
<seg id="1899">"I have visited one of these places in the Mexican city of Tapachula, it is located on the border to Guatemala."</seg>
<seg id="1900">It is a very simple hotel close to the city centre.</seg>
<seg id="1901">"led by a 59-year-old Mexican woman, a small woman with a corals-pink brillenframe and gold-colored earrings in teddy bear form."</seg>
<seg id="1902">She is called Concepción González Ramírez and was born in Tapachula and grew up there. still they know many under the name Mama Africa.</seg>
<seg id="1903">This nickname is owed to the fact that the hotel (or rather it) has become a target for Africans and Haitians who are on transit.</seg>
<seg id="1904">The hotel does not have any charm.</seg>
<seg id="1905">"for about 2.50 dollars the night guests sleep in simple rooms, with bare, crumbling walls and beds made of metal."</seg>
<seg id="1906">In the anteroom there is a parrot in a cage.</seg>
<seg id="1907">There is no sign for the hotel - nevertheless hundreds of African and Haitian migrants arrive here.</seg>
<seg id="1908">"sometimes, Mrs. Ramírez, tells the people in full minibuses and from the upper part of the coast they start calling:" Mama Africa! "</seg>
<seg id="1909">Where are you from Mama Africa?.</seg>
<seg id="1910">"at the moment, it is rather quiet, but this year Ramírez has received 200 guests at the same time."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"there are only 24 rooms, some have also already slept on boxes outside."</seg>
<seg id="1912">She doesn't want to reject anyone.</seg>
<seg id="1913">"she also helps them and brings them to the hospital when they are ill, she buys them drugs that they cannot pay, she massaging them with a balm the feet drained from the long journey."</seg>
<seg id="1914">"Tychique Sebastiao, originally from Angola, has arrived recently."</seg>
<seg id="1915">I asked him if Mama Africa was an appropriate nickname for Mrs. Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1916">The family Sebastiao (with her daughter Merrui who has a yoghurtbart) posing with Concepción González Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1917">The family came from Angola to Brazil and hopes to go to Boston.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Photo: Amy Bracken.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"yes, yes," he answers with a smile. "I really feel it suits her because African women are very nice women."</seg>
<seg id="1920">Very loving.</seg>
<seg id="1921">She has the warmth of a mother...</seg>
<seg id="1922">We feel very comfortable here. "</seg>
<seg id="1923">Sebastiao travels with his sister who hopes to go to Boston to find her husband and the three children.</seg>
<seg id="1924">"they have lived in Brazil already, but it is for some Africans who are on their way to the United States to make a first stop in South America and then pull towards the north."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"the family had heard from other companions of Mama Africa." "Mama Africa is a well-known name on the track," "explains Felix Michelet, a guest from Haiti."</seg>
<seg id="1926">He says that the Haitians and the Africans often travel along the route and that Africans are already talking about Whatsapp by Ms Ramírez.</seg>
<seg id="1927">"like many of his companions, Michelet lived in Brazil before and worked as a construction worker on building sites for the Olympic Games and the World Cup."</seg>
<seg id="1928">"when the Brazilian economy was weaker, he began his journey to the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1929">He has been a guest at Mama Africa for months: he sells SIM cards to save the money needed to buy the bus ticket to Tijuana.</seg>
<seg id="1930">I ask him if he will have contact with Mrs. Ramírez in the future.</seg>
<seg id="1931">"Mama Africa is our mother and we never let her go again," he answers smiling. "we will always stay in touch."</seg>
<seg id="1932">Ms. Ramírez narrates that her guests send her often text messages when they have gone to greet her or to report her about the course of her journey.</seg>
<seg id="1933">She explains that her Christian faith is the propulsion of her work.</seg>
<seg id="1934">"she doesn't know much about Africa, but her guests have taught her to prepare chicken like Ghana."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"Mrs. Ramírez is perhaps very well known here, but she is not the only spark of hope for the migrants travelling through Tapachula."</seg>
<seg id="1936">At the other end of the city leads a dead end to Jesús Valenzuela.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"this winter, Valenzuela and his family have included migrants in their small house."</seg>
<seg id="1938">He is a policeman and has found that bus tickets to numerous African migrants are sold too expensive.</seg>
<seg id="1939">"he has begun to help them get a reasonable price, then he offered them his house for a dollar the night offered."</seg>
<seg id="1940">"at the moment there are 25 people, mainly Haitians."</seg>
<seg id="1941">"some sleep on blankets on the floor, but at least they have electricity, a washing machine and a cooking place outside."</seg>
<seg id="1942">Valenzuela explains that he knows what the guests are going through.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"I have lived in the United States," he says. "I have experienced what they are experiencing."</seg>
<seg id="1944">I crossed the border over the desert and we suffered.</seg>
<seg id="1945">There are places where people help and others do not help. that's why I give them my support.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"after having lived there for three years, he was expelled from the United States after a raid on his work place."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"the majority of migrants travelling through Tapachula comes from Central America, other inhabitants also open the doors of their homes for them."</seg>
<seg id="1948">José Antonio Cordova Meléndez tells me he fled to Honduras with his wife and three children who wanted to blackmail him without having a plan.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"in Tapachula he asked for accommodation and an unknown, a single parent, offered him her roof."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"a few months later, the family still lives there and she tries to decide where the next steps should go."</seg>
<seg id="1951">Back in the house of Mama Africa everything is again full of guests.</seg>
<seg id="1952">"in the corridors, travelers always consult their phones."</seg>
<seg id="1953">"a minibus arrived today and brought 20 new guests, a large part of Somalia."</seg>
<seg id="1954">"Mrs. Ramírez seems happy that her house is full, but she is also nostalgic, because of those who went away."</seg>
<seg id="1955">Like a proud grandmother she puffs in her album with numerous photos.</seg>
<seg id="1956">"there is one of her daughter with African hair spots she has made an Kunene, some photos of her grandchildren and many travellers more, boy and old."</seg>
<seg id="1957">She laughs sadly as she pretends to me.</seg>
<seg id="1958">"Ya se fueron," she repeats every time. "they have gone."</seg>
<seg id="1959">China: Xinjiang residents are forced to install a surveillance app on their mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="1960">"a check point for personal communication devices in Xinjiang by Twitter users, where it attracts"</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the inhabitants of Xinjiang, an ethnic minority region in western China, are forced to install a spyware on their mobile phones."</seg>
<seg id="1962">"on July 10, the mobile phone users in the Tianshan district of Urumqi received a mobile notification in which they instruct the district government to install a monitoring app called Jingwang (or" Web Clean ")."</seg>
<seg id="1963">"in the announcement, it is said that the app will prevent access to terrorist information."</seg>
<seg id="1964">"however, the authorities could also use the app for more than combating terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="1965">"according to an exclusive report from Radio Free Asia, 10 Kazakh women were arrested in the Autonomous Ili Kazakh Prefecture because they, shortly after they installed the app, exchanged messages with a private WeChat group."</seg>
<seg id="1966">"the police reported that the app would identify and prosecute the sources and the distribution channels of the terrorists, along with" illegal religious "activities and" harmful information, "including videos, pictures, eBooks and documents."</seg>
<seg id="1967">Jingwanese's website describes the app as follows:</seg>
<seg id="1968">"Jingwang is a protection service with system categories for children and adults, introduced by Jiangsu Telecom."</seg>
<seg id="1969">"the main feature is blocking pornographic web pages, online fraud, trojans and phishing pages to make users aware of how much time they spend online and remotely control their home network."</seg>
<seg id="1970">This app with the children's filters is designed to help children develop a healthy lifestyle.</seg>
<seg id="1971">An app with these functions can of course be used in many ways.</seg>
<seg id="1972">"for example, the" remote control "could enable state actors or even hackers to manipulate or steal a person's home network."</seg>
<seg id="1973">This introduction is in line with other measures to control digital activities in this region.</seg>
<seg id="1974">"while announcements about digital censorship in China tend to focus mostly on the experiences of users in the larger cities in the east and south, reality is very often darker for those who live in remote, crowded ethnic minority regions like Xinjiang and Tibet."</seg>
<seg id="1975">"in order to limit unrest and dissatisfaction in conflict areas, the authorities often arrange extreme measures and surveillance measures as well as routine Internet shutdowns."</seg>
<seg id="1976">"the Twitter-based media outlet," Images from mainland China, "published censored news in China, showed photos from a checkpoint where policemen checked the residents indiscriminately to see if they had installed the surveillance app."</seg>
<seg id="1977">The authorities in Xinjian make sure people use the official Jingwang app.</seg>
<seg id="1978">A mobile notification required people to install the app in 10 days.</seg>
<seg id="1979">"if you are detected at a checkpoint with a device without this software, they could be imprisoned for up to 10 days."</seg>
<seg id="1980">This is a setback for technological development.</seg>
<seg id="1981">They have forced people to use appliances intended for elderly people.</seg>
<seg id="1982">This is a form of imprisonment by the rest-growth technology.</seg>
<seg id="1983">We are back in Maos China.</seg>
<seg id="1984">"images from mainland China" (Red-Africans) also published a Jingwang product description, from which the software can raise the password request of a Windows operating system and thus unrestricted access to the computer's hard drive. "</seg>
<seg id="1985">After installing Jingwang computers and cell phones in Xinjiang become electronic handcuffs.</seg>
<seg id="1986">The rules in Jingwang may be a reaction to the orders of the City Council to minimise the dissemination of illegal content.</seg>
<seg id="1987">"all government branches, authorities and institutions associated with the party, including universities and research institutions, are obliged to follow the instructions of the Cybersecurity Office in the operation of their computers and communication devices."</seg>
<seg id="1988">"a recent Freedom House report, an American human rights organisation, also mentioned these new surveillance methods:"</seg>
<seg id="1989">"in Xinjiang, the authorities published a regulation on 27 June in a district of the regional capital of Urumqi, with the directive to register their" personal ID cards, mobile phones, external drives, portable hard drives, notebooks and media memory cards "at local police."</seg>
<seg id="1990">"the intention is obviously to identify and destroy any" terrorist videos, "however, this action violates the personality rights of Urumquis three million inhabitants and gives them penalties for a number of other possible offenses, including those relating to peaceful religious or political messages."</seg>

<seg id="2008">"I broke through the silence, screaming several times" "Allahu Akbar" "from my house roof."</seg>

<seg id="2015">He put on.</seg>
<seg id="2016">"then I learned the following: no matter how much honey you can swallow - nothing can give you back your voice, after you screamed it all the way up to the office of security service out of the body."</seg>
<seg id="2017">I arrived there.</seg>
<seg id="2018">The Colonel Ghassan was there with several of his men; my father was already there as I now.</seg>
<seg id="2019">"the Colonel Ghassan begins to speak:" "let me also hear how you write" "Allahu Akbar", "or you are only brave enough to scream if we are not close."</seg>
<seg id="2020">His hateful eyes turned to me.</seg>

<seg id="2022">What I did then has nothing to do with courage.</seg>
<seg id="2023">"I was 18 years old, it was the fourth time that I stood in front of this building."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"perhaps it was about my foolishness, vanity; perhaps in the revolution."</seg>
<seg id="2025">I was so sure of my thing when I replied: "I wouldn't have thought you've forgotten my voice since yesterday.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"and I think I never stopped looking at you, so why should I do it now?"</seg>
<seg id="2027">"it was the shortest entertainment that could have such fatal consequences for me, and yet I don't regret a word of what I said."</seg>

<seg id="2036">"other than usual, they have probably assigned to me a bigger cell this time."</seg>
<seg id="2037">"I have to share it with only one more prisoner, and I am allowed to sit immediately without waiting for their permission."</seg>
<seg id="2038">"after a few minutes that felt like a whole life, the official left the cell, and I went back to an old proven method of communication: to fight against the wall with the fist."</seg>
<seg id="2039">"I learned that my cell-mate was a" "first-keeper". ""</seg>
<seg id="2040">After a long hesitation he finally answered me.</seg>

<seg id="2042">"in perfect darkness, no striking facial features can be seen in me, and doctors don't exist here; we are all just numbers."</seg>
<seg id="2043">Maybe someone whose voice sounds like mine?</seg>
<seg id="2044">All the answers deny his existence.</seg>
<seg id="2045">Perhaps he was moved to one of the big cells.</seg>

<seg id="2054">They are here to be interrogated.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"thus the secret was lifted: to protect the state security from us and prevent us from releasing the traitor and the terrorists in us, they speak in the Alawittic dialect - so they played out their confessional extortion card and revealed the narrow view of their world view."</seg>

<seg id="2058">"he starts a" pleasant "conversation, in spite of the facial expressions that slip on him:" my boy, you are still young, you can start so much more important with your life than join this diary and protest against demonstrations that will soon come to an end. "</seg>
<seg id="2059">I didn't answer.</seg>
<seg id="2060">I have used it to not answer.</seg>
<seg id="2061">I can no longer say exactly when insults and punches have become an ordinary communication tool for me after a friendly conversation.</seg>
<seg id="2062">When and how it happened was unimportant.</seg>
<seg id="2063">"some voice in me said that I had to get used to being punished, though I had nothing to earn this punishment."</seg>

<seg id="2065">His command is to tear me as much flesh as possible from the body.</seg>
<seg id="2066">He calls the affectionate "confession."</seg>
<seg id="2067">It starts with a plastic tube which probably comes from the cloaks.</seg>
<seg id="2068">Your executioner rejoices in your cry.</seg>
<seg id="2069">"give him the pleasure, you cannot measure yourself with him, and you cannot hold back your cries."</seg>
<seg id="2070">"my cries were not enough for him, why they exchanged the pipe through a cable."</seg>
<seg id="2071">"during my first arrest, I wondered if the investigator had previously worked as a garbage collector, or whether it belonged to the normal work equipment."</seg>
<seg id="2072">They had intertwined four cables to show us the great invention of a giant cable from their point of view.</seg>
<seg id="2073">Within a single hour three of them changed while I was still in the row.</seg>
<seg id="2074">"I had lost every feeling in my body - and also my voice, which is why I listened to scream."</seg>
<seg id="2075">"the executioner noticed the cooling, and found no favor in it, which is why he intervened as the next to an electrically charged rod."</seg>

<seg id="2095">"he lives in the top floor of his family house, which has been part of them since 1967; the year when Israel completed his occupation of the West Bank and Hdaibs family forced to flee from their village in Palestine, in which they had lived as felicyewitnesses (e.g. Farmer)."</seg>
<seg id="2096">"for six years now, Hdaib has been a passionate activist opposing the conservative majority and questioning its well-established views on gender roles, sexuality and freedom of expression through art and rapeseed."</seg>
<seg id="2097">"with his music, which often deals with subjects like Orientalism, racism and the situation of Palestinian refugees, he also challenges the core of the entire Arab world."</seg>
<seg id="2098">"with his 25 years, Hdaib sees himself as someone who is not limited by boundaries in his thinking, and he can sympathize with the people who suffer from the devastating consequences of foreign intervention in countries such as Iraq, Yemen, Syria and Libya."</seg>
<seg id="2099">"even if he does not admit it openly, he has a special reluctance against American foreign policy."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Hdaib considers his art in his studio in Amman.</seg>
<seg id="2101">Taken by the author.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"Hdaib does not believe that his compassion for those who try to survive in war zones, have anything to do with his identity as" Palestinian flared by the second generation "- so he calls himself even though he was born in Jordan and has never been in Palestine until now."</seg>
<seg id="2103">"I don't think about my own circumstances so much," "Hdaib emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="2104">"then he adds:" I think so, because I am a man, "while he poured out Nescafé in water in two cups. it is the holy month of Ramadan; in this time it is intended for Muslims to fast from sunrise to sunset."</seg>
<seg id="2105">The Jordanian law also states that the public consumption of food during Ramadan is illegal.</seg>
<seg id="2106">"obviously, Hdaib has a certain weakness for breaking with ancient traditions; on the other hand, a cup of coffee on a ferring hot young day has little to do with protest against Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2107">"basically, the sludge of lukewarm coffee and the wavds of the Kent cigarette in the nose primarily speak of freedom."</seg>
<seg id="2108">"sometimes Jordan feels like a prison under the open sky, especially when you look into neighbouring countries."</seg>
<seg id="2109">"therefore, it is easy to do basic things - as in the public while drinking water - in order not to land in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"recently, Jordan's Ministry of Interior has cancelled a performance by the band Mashrou 'Leila, for the second time."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"some MPs who support the Islamic campaign front - the Jordanian branch of the Muslim Brotherhood - argued that the sexual orientation of the homosexual frontsman Hamed Sinno, contradicts the cultural and traditional norms of the country and is the main reason for the concert."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"the deputy and former press spokesperson for the Islamic coalition Dima Tahboub said in an interview with CNN that the concert" "just" "was cancelled because of the singer's sexual orientation."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"many also claim that the band's commitment in matters such as Arab Spring, human rights and freedom of expression in the Arab world is dangerous activism, which poses the proven legitimacy of authoritarian regimes across the region."</seg>
<seg id="2114">"in a public statement, Mashrou 'Leila estimated the Jordanian people as" progressive supporters of human rights, "who continue to choose" for an intellectual and cultural pluralism. ""</seg>
<seg id="2115">"this statement should probably not be simply shallow rhetoric, but in fact reflect an ever more clearly crystallizing reality in Jordan, which clearly appears in Hdaibs's work."</seg>
<seg id="2116">"in 2016, Hdaib turned back traditional sex men to Leibe, forming his vision of the fate of Arab women who have premarital sex."</seg>
<seg id="2117">"the picture shows the skeleton of an apparently worn unknown woman, whose arms and legs stretch up to the corners of the canvas."</seg>
<seg id="2118">"it is surrounded by a red lake, perhaps the blood of countless women who have lost their lives through the hands of those whom they should trust."</seg>
<seg id="2119">"in the past few years, the number of 'honorary cures' has increased in Jordan - the unofficial outside of Jordan."</seg>
<seg id="2120">"according to human rights Watch, the number of volunteers in 2016 reached its peak; however, it is still difficult to add that Jordan is lacking the institutional infrastructure to support the women victims of murder or domestic violence in an appropriate manner."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"according to a crime against crime from 1954, women who are exposed to the danger of domestic violence can" "be kept in prison indefinitely," "and for their release, it is often necessary for years of bureaucratic effort and the family's guarantee that nothing will happen to the woman."</seg>
<seg id="2122">Also Hdaibs music enjoys great popularity and is known not to shy away from subjects which are long as taboos in his country.</seg>
<seg id="2123">"Hdaib denies that his work is political, but admits that he cannot separate his music, which is full of explicit references to sexuality, freedom and expression, not from politics."</seg>
<seg id="2124">"I come from the Middle East, man."</seg>
<seg id="2125">"I was introduced to politics," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2126">"in a song called" Edward Sa'ed, "Hdaib attacks the question of Palestinian identity."</seg>
<seg id="2127">"in" "Lawla al 3aib" "and" "Ghareeb", "the focus is on poverty."</seg>
<seg id="2128">The list of songs that are political in the core can be continued.</seg>
<seg id="2129">"in March 2016, Hdaib released a song entitled" Santandano. ""</seg>
<seg id="2130">In this song a verse is repeated strikingly often:</seg>
<seg id="2131">"you are free, and everyone else is it."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"in the further course of the song Hdaib describes the world as a kind of market where one can, in his words," get what you want "- be it faith or non-belief, heterogeneity or homosexuality."</seg>
<seg id="2133">He noted that hardly anyone in Jordan talks about the rights of gay and lesbians and that comments on the equality of LGBTQ + individuals were still heavily censored by 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in 2014, Hdaib conducted an interview for the popular Jordanian online program Roya, to later note that his comments were torn from the context, twisted and in his opinion were censored."</seg>
<seg id="2135">"on Youtube it was uploaded without cuts, but streamed only a edited version," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2136">"today, Hdaib is openly campaigning for the Arab LGBTQ + community and believes that intolerance to homosexuals is not contrary to Islam."</seg>
<seg id="2137">"he mentions Abu Nuwhat, a poet of the eighth century, who has remained in memory even today thanks to his homoerotic poems."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"Hdaib asks himself: if Abu Nuwhat, who was to work later on behalf of the caliph, could write openly about homosexuality in the eighth century, why can Jordanians not?"</seg>
<seg id="2139">"the real problem, so Hdaib, has nothing to do with Mashrou 'Leila or the fact that the concert was cancelled."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"in the Hashemite Kingdom, it is nothing new that the government sanctioned attacks on freedom of expression and that progressive voices are being silenced."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"recently, in January 2017, the Jordanian news service established several former government officials and members of the teacher's association, stating that they have critically challenged comments in social media about the problems associated with the corruption deeply rooted in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"in view of this, Hdaibs's opinion is, according to this, only the tip of the iceberg - the real challenge is to bring about a structural change in the next generation of the Jordanians."</seg>
<seg id="2143">"for him, progress is a constant giving and taking. Jordan has now denied Mashrou 'Leila for the second time in a row, but the path of progress - so it looks Hdaib - consists of slow, thoughtful and internal changes."</seg>
<seg id="2144">"ultimately Hdaib, like millions of other Arabs, dreams of an Arab world without intervention from abroad."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"he does not only dream of bringing his work to Baghdad, Jerusalem and Damascus, but also of experiencing" it. ""</seg>
<seg id="2146">"perhaps the region will approach a genuine and fundamental openness with the help of music, art and literature - and not by bombs, scattered uniforms and artificially induced democracies."</seg>
<seg id="2147">"until the time has come, Hdaib will continue to rap and therefore resist."</seg>
<seg id="2148">This report was made possible by the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting which was attended by Aman as student Fellow.</seg>
<seg id="2149">Nebuta in Aomori is one of the 3 biggest festivals in Japan.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"these big, extravagant warriors dolls are so fantastic!!!"</seg>
<seg id="2151">There are numerous theories regarding the origin of the Nebuta festival.</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it is believed that it is a variation of the Tanabata festival, which is usually celebrated in August in many areas of Tohokus. another theory states that the forlorries, the drums and dancing have marched over more than a thousand years, to force the indigenous inhabitants of the region, the Emishi, to their knees."</seg>
<seg id="2153">We are at the Nebuta festival in Aomori.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"we were able to grab some great seats, so we have a great view."</seg>
<seg id="2155">One can hardly imagine how large these parts are...</seg>
<seg id="2156">"a community centre in the capital, Meguro Gajoen, organized a two-month exhibition on Wa no Akari (literally)."</seg>
<seg id="2157">I have been looking for the Meguro gaujoen for a long time: two forts are just to be seen.</seg>
<seg id="2158">"nevertheless, for many people who take the journey to Aomori, the Nebuta festival is the only true - and still a breathtaking way to spend the summer:"</seg>
<seg id="2159">"Yattemare!</seg>

<seg id="2161">I was there and watched the # NebutaFestival.</seg>
<seg id="2162">The sight of an 18 meter high car was incredible.</seg>

<seg id="2167">"rarely, outer appearances and personal care were as important as in this story, because they help keep the Peruvian youth away from crime and promote a legitimate profession like that of the hairdresser."</seg>
<seg id="2168">"El Callao, Peru's most important port, is located on the coast of the Pacific Ocean, close to the historic center of Lima, a region with a very high crime rate where street smoking and illegal drug trafficking are everyday."</seg>
<seg id="2169">A survey published in April 2017 showed that 51.5 per cent of the population of this region will not feel safe.</seg>
<seg id="2170">"at the same time, Peru - like many other Central and South American countries - is experiencing an increasing demand for aesthetic services for men."</seg>
<seg id="2171">"the trend, appearance and thus also the unusual hairstyles of famous athletes such as Paolo Guerrero (Peru), Arturo Vidal (Peru), Pedro Gallese (Peru), or Neymar (Brazil), has led to becoming more and more regular citizens in the hands of hairdressers that can recreate these elaborate hairstyles."</seg>
<seg id="2172">"the unprecedented demand for hairstyles, which go to the extreme limits of imagination and creativity, has even inspired an annual event, the competition of hairdressers" Batalla de Barberos, "which has been taking place since 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2173">Experts compete against each other to show who can create the most eccentric looks as you can see in the following video (further videos about current competitions are available on the public Facebook profile Batalla de Barberos).</seg>
<seg id="2174">"educational institutions such as the school of Augusto Salazar Bondy, located in El Callao, found an opportunity to convince young people to exchange their weapons against hairdressing tools and to receive training in hairdressers in place of bad advice that allows them to find work."</seg>
<seg id="2175">"motivated by this activity and the opportunities offered, dozens of young people have seen that they can take a job that is currently in fashion."</seg>
<seg id="2176">The school offered special training workshops before the school year beginning in March and reported some of their successes:</seg>
<seg id="2177">"in 1995, we were the only specialized school in the municipality and the district where we are very proud, because we have built this educational community out of love for the children."</seg>
<seg id="2178">Colombia: securitisation letters to guerrilla fighters</seg>
<seg id="2179">Photo: Valentina Monsalve.</seg>
<seg id="2180">Use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2181">"the following article is the edited version of the" declaration of love for guerrilla fighters, "published by the international online magazine Tea After Twelve."</seg>
<seg id="2182">The article is published here as part of a partnership with Global Voices.</seg>
<seg id="2183">Why do we only write love letters to people we know?</seg>
<seg id="2184">"is it not even more important, people who feel extorted to meet affection?"</seg>
<seg id="2185">"this was precisely the question of the young Colombian activist Leonardo Párraga from the BogotArt Foundation and Cristian Palacios from the Young Youth Foundation, inspired by the Young Youth Foundation, encouraging young people to write letters to guerrilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2186">"recently, their country was the setting of a historic event and they wanted to contribute their share to this: after years of negotiations, the Colombian government had concluded a peace treaty with the guerrilla movement FARC (German: revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), which forms the final point of the longest armed conflict in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"internationally, the signing of the peace treaty was so significant that the Colombian President José Manuel Santos received the Nobel Peace Prize for his merits."</seg>
<seg id="2188">"before the Colombians, however, there is still a long way to speak of true reconciliation and peace."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"guerrilla fighters, who have lived in illegal camps for many years, have been exposed to war rhetoric and have carried their arms around the clock, must now reintegrate themselves into life as civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2190">"in turn, Colombian society, which has become accustomed to life in constant fear and in some cases of deep hatred towards guerrilla fighters, has to take them into their ranks and support them in building up a new life."</seg>
<seg id="2191">Leonardo and Cristian were convinced that the young Colombians would join together and help in the integration process.</seg>
<seg id="2192">"and that's exactly what they did: so far, thousands of young people have already written letters - love messages to former guerrilla fighters in order to welcome them back in society."</seg>
<seg id="2193">The aim of the campaign is 6900 letters - one for every former guerrilla fighter - which should then be handed over personally.</seg>
<seg id="2194">Valentine's Day as inspiration for the campaign</seg>
<seg id="2195">"the idea for the Letters to Reconciliation was born on the World Summit of Nobel Peace Laureates, which took place in Bogotá in February 2017. Leonardo and Cristian had the opportunity to talk briefly with Kailash Satyarthi, who was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2196">"this stated that we write thousands of love letters to the people we love, but forget those who need it much more."</seg>
<seg id="2197">"he plans, he told us to share his love with people who needed the most urgent response this year."</seg>
<seg id="2198">"the letters will show that Colombian society is ready to make the discourse of a history of war a common history of peace," they say. "</seg>
<seg id="2199">"until now, more than 2000 letters have been collected during the campaign."</seg>
<seg id="2200">"the initiative is represented in all major cities in Colombia, such as Cali, Manizales, Medellín, Barranquilla and Bogotá."</seg>
<seg id="2201">I would never have thought someone would forgive me</seg>
<seg id="2202">The first 500 letters were handed over to one of the UN camps in the Caldono Cauca region on 19 March.</seg>
<seg id="2203">"a group of 40 students from the University of Javeriana in Cali, two members of the municipal administration of Cali and Leonardo from the BogotArt foundation, travelled to the camp to hand over the letters personally."</seg>
<seg id="2204">"the members of the FARC were in the same way as they had done before, in order to accept the orders of their leaders."</seg>
<seg id="2205">"but this time they did not receive orders, but letters full of support from people from all over the country."</seg>
<seg id="2206">"it was a very moving moment for everyone involved." it's incredible how many different feelings can be traversed in just a few hours - from fear to happiness and everything in between, "explained the political science student Manuela Jiménez Avila later."</seg>
<seg id="2207">"Sandra Parra, an employee of the Governor of the province of Valle del Cauca described this unforgettable experience so:"</seg>
<seg id="2208">"after passing the letters, a former fighter took me through the camp of the guerilla fighters."</seg>
<seg id="2209">"when I entered one of the" "Camillo" "(a kind of cottage where the guerrilla fighters are living) I saw a guerrilla fighter who wrote something."</seg>
<seg id="2210">"I was afraid to go down, because beside him on the bed was a MGL-Pomegranate, a deadly weapon in the Sleeping Beauty."</seg>
<seg id="2211">"and I said to him," "Hello, what are you doing?" "he answered," "I answer a letter that someone wrote to me."</seg>
<seg id="2212">It is a very beautiful and hopeful letter.</seg>
<seg id="2213">"never before in my life someone wrote me something so beautiful, so I answer."</seg>
<seg id="2214">I hugged him quite firmly and sat down beside the pomegranates.</seg>
<seg id="2215">"perhaps he too was tired of the war, tired of being all the years of the faithful companion of this fighter, and wanted to help him write this letter."</seg>
<seg id="2216">The man told me more about his life. he never had any other life expected as a war. join the FARC was the only way to keep him and his six brothers before starvation. "I never thought someone would forgive me for my mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="2217">But now I know there is a society outside that waits for us with open arms.</seg>
<seg id="2218">"until now, I have learned only how to deal with weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2219">"but now where peace reigns, I can learn many things and work in dignity."</seg>
<seg id="2220">New voices and voices</seg>
<seg id="2221">"at the start, students and some leaders of the FARC were invited to a discussion board."</seg>
<seg id="2222">The students were all grown up as already a war and the FARC already acted in secret.</seg>
<seg id="2223">"this is why the leaders of the FARC have declared the history of the organization, their ideals and gave insight into their views on the peace process:" for many years, we have seen how social injustice is working on the whole Colombian people. "</seg>
<seg id="2224">"the goal of this magnitude is to overcome all obstacles," one of them said. "</seg>
<seg id="2225">Manuela was impressed:</seg>
<seg id="2226">"hearing these people who had never heard of hearing and had no right to vote, and realize that the people I often saw as monsters and even hated even people with beautiful feelings turned around by their living circumstances and their environment was very painful for me."</seg>
<seg id="2227">"the reality in which the country lives, hurts me."</seg>
<seg id="2228">"but it comforts me that all people - including those who have killed and caused so much damage, can teach us something and give a smile and a hug."</seg>
<seg id="2229">Many former fighters have responded to the letters.</seg>
<seg id="2230">"Gustavo González, the commandant of the camp in Caldono-Cauca, wrote for example Darío de Jesús Monsalve, Archbishop of the town of Cali, following letter:"</seg>
<seg id="2231">The Colombians were prophesied that after the disarmament peace would rule.</seg>
<seg id="2232">But this is not the case.</seg>
<seg id="2233">"as long as there is inequality, hunger and lack of education, health care and employment opportunities, there will always be people ready to resort to arms, lift up and protest for their rights. and this is also totally justified (...)."</seg>
<seg id="2234">"we of the FARC now rely on peace, on a policy without weapons."</seg>
<seg id="2235">"that is why we call all defenders of peace - no matter what race, religion or ideology they belong - to rise above all those who dream of a country in war."</seg>
<seg id="2236">"we give you our word, make our contribution and bring sacrifices, because we know from our own experience that nothing is easy. those among us who defend life as the basis of existence will be many difficulties ahead."</seg>
<seg id="2237">"on our way there will be many obstacles, but together we will overcome them."</seg>

<seg id="2244">"with terror, activists have witnessed the reports of recent months about the persecution of gay men in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2245">But the threat that hangs over the LGBTQ community there is not just over night.</seg>
<seg id="2246">"OC Media had the opportunity to talk to a transsexual woman from Grosny, who shared some of her experiences with us and talked with us about what happened in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2247">"the LGBTQ legal situation in Chechnya won the international headlines several months ago, after reports have been published that address the kidnapping, torture and killing of queer men in the republic."</seg>
<seg id="2248">The first report was published by journalist Elena Milaschina in Nowaya Gazeta; she put a light on the methods of Chechen authorities who took suspicious queer men and put them in secret prisons in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2249">"you brought a monster to the world"</seg>
<seg id="2250">"Sabrina, a transgender woman, was born in Grosny and grew up there."</seg>
<seg id="2251">"since childhood, she felt that she was actually a woman."</seg>
<seg id="2252">"when she was grown up, she became aware that Chechnya was not a safe place for her, so she moved to Moscow."</seg>
<seg id="2253">"after a group of Chechens had experienced the gender equality of their landlady, the hunt for Sabrina was opened."</seg>
<seg id="2254">"from fear of her life, she moved to the USA in the last analysis."</seg>
<seg id="2255">Sabrina: I was a volunteer in a human rights organisation.</seg>
<seg id="2256">One day I was told that someone needed my help.</seg>
<seg id="2257">"it was a friend from Dagestan, a woman who was in trouble."</seg>
<seg id="2258">"she had no money, so I took her without hesitation."</seg>
<seg id="2259">"while I tried to help her, someone from whom I thought he would be a friend, a copy of my documents and spread it all over the Internet, with my phone number and a picture of me. he sent her to his Chechen friends, with the following message:" "then there are no men in Chechnya that can eliminate this shame?"</seg>
<seg id="2260">After that the photos of my documents through WhatsApp made the round.</seg>
<seg id="2261">On 10 October 2015 I was attacked.</seg>
<seg id="2262">"when I was just about getting a few shopping bags from the back seat of my car, I heard a male voice saying," "Here is a gift for you from your uncle."</seg>
<seg id="2263">"when I turned around, I felt something in my body, but I did nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2264">"then I heard another sentence, but this time in Chechnya:" "how long do you want to adore the family, you snare?"</seg>
<seg id="2265">I didn't know the person.</seg>
<seg id="2266">"I only know that it was a young man, not 30 years old."</seg>
<seg id="2267">Then I lost consciousness and woke up again in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2268">Apparently some women had all got along and started screaming.</seg>
<seg id="2269">The man had fled.</seg>
<seg id="2270">The women had called an ambulance.</seg>
<seg id="2271">"in the hospital, I learned that I had two bite wounds in my right lung."</seg>
<seg id="2272">"OC Media: in which wings were you laid, in which men or women?"</seg>
<seg id="2273">"Sabrina: my documents are outdated, there is still my male name on it, but the doctor understood and put me to the women."</seg>
<seg id="2274">I am very thankful for that.</seg>
<seg id="2275">"when I first read his name at his office door, I was afraid to do it; it was a Muslim, a Caucasian name."</seg>
<seg id="2276">But he turned out to be a good person.</seg>
<seg id="2277">I am grateful to him for being respectful with me.</seg>
<seg id="2278">I spent more than a month in the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="2279">Last February I received threats.</seg>
<seg id="2280">"they called me, wrote me - relatives, strangers, some completely unknown."</seg>
<seg id="2281">That was the beginning of a nightmare.</seg>
<seg id="2282">My family was visited by neighbors and some distant relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2283">"they asked me to send me back to Chechnya, to prove that it was all a lie."</seg>
<seg id="2284">"they presented absurd demands: some said to me, I must prove it by walking up without through the streets; others wanted me to appear on the official TV in Grosny and say that I had not changed my sex, that all was just bad speech, and Photoshop."</seg>
<seg id="2285">I have grain size C - what should I say on TV?</seg>
<seg id="2286">OC Media: how did your family try to deal with this pressure?</seg>
<seg id="2287">Sabrina: it's still hard for them.</seg>
<seg id="2288">Some elderly people once said my mother on the street.</seg>
<seg id="2289">"they said to her," "You brought a monster to the world that has damaged not only your family, but the entire republic."</seg>
<seg id="2290">"we cannot touch you because you are a pious woman, but you must disappear from here."</seg>
<seg id="2291">In my mother it became too much and she lay down a rope around her neck.</seg>
<seg id="2292">"thankfully, the neighbors came and saved them."</seg>
<seg id="2293">At that time I had to change the apartment several times a day.</seg>
<seg id="2294">"I moved to an apartment and a few hours later, under the window stood a car with darkened window panes and a number plate with a 95 on it."</seg>
<seg id="2295">"after it happened for the third time, it became clear to me that there was something rotten."</seg>
<seg id="2296">My human rights friends checked the number plates - it turned out that I was persecuted.</seg>
<seg id="2297">OC Media: how did you flee?</seg>
<seg id="2298">Sabrina: with the help of activists.</seg>
<seg id="2299">"for security reasons I don't want to give up their names, but I want to say that I remember them all; they really helped me."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"with her help, I left the country, but then something incredible happened."</seg>
<seg id="2301">I can still not understand how it could be.</seg>
<seg id="2302">Shortly before my departure from Moscow I bought a new SIM card to call my mother as soon as I arrived.</seg>
<seg id="2303">"I bought them without registering, without notice, without notice."</seg>
<seg id="2304">I broke my old SIM card and threw it into the trash.</seg>
<seg id="2305">Arrived and checked into the hotel.</seg>
<seg id="2306">The number had been registered to a stranger.</seg>
<seg id="2307">I put the SIM card into my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="2308">"at the moment I wanted to call my mother via WhatsApp, I got a message:" "you don't believe you're in security, just because you have left the country?"</seg>
<seg id="2309">Our people already know which hotel you are hiding in. you even know your room number.</seg>
<seg id="2310">Only to prove it to you: it is number 115.</seg>
<seg id="2311">Can you imagine that?!</seg>
<seg id="2312">That was actually my room number.</seg>
<seg id="2313">OC Media: are you still in contact with your family?</seg>
<seg id="2314">Sabrina: only with my mother and my sisters.</seg>
<seg id="2315">"however, we don't talk about gender equality, this is a taboo topic."</seg>
<seg id="2316">I still carry some traditional Caucasian elements in me.</seg>
<seg id="2317">"as much as I wish, I cannot overcome this spiritual barrier."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"I always say that as long as my mother is alive, I will do my best to not hurt her."</seg>
<seg id="2319">"when we chat with camera, I actually try to look at how the person looks at which they remember from their past - so to my male form."</seg>
<seg id="2320">But that is very difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2321">OC Media: do you know something about the current situation in Chechnya?</seg>
<seg id="2322">"what do your friends, those who have stayed there?"</seg>
<seg id="2323">Sabrina: I submitted a report in Washington last week.</seg>
<seg id="2324">"for him, I needed up-to-date information on the situation in Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2325">I talked to someone who had lunch for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2326">"he said that during Ramadan, no people were arrested and tortured, but also that all the end of Ramadan could hardly wait and he did not lock a new wave."</seg>
<seg id="2327">Most likely they will now concentrate on family and relatives.</seg>
<seg id="2328">"with this I mean, they probably charge the relatives who take care of the problem with the affected person and at the end demand proof that the so-called" honor "has experienced through blood satisfaction."</seg>
<seg id="2329">OC Media: are you still wearing gay men in these secret prisons?</seg>
<seg id="2330">Sabrina: a friend of mine says there aren't very many.</seg>
<seg id="2331">"if, then, especially those who have no rich relatives or who were dropped by their relatives in order to surrender to Kadyrows."</seg>
<seg id="2332">"as far as I know, they are held there so that they can be presented as terrorists later."</seg>
<seg id="2333">"say," "If they are killed, they will show their bodies on television and claim they have attacked any village or military base."</seg>
<seg id="2334">Do you understand?</seg>
<seg id="2335">"as if these people were not simply gone, they were specifically submerged in order to radicalise."</seg>
<seg id="2336">"OC Media: is that just a guess, or do you have a source for this information?"</seg>
<seg id="2337">Sabrina: I just quote someone who was imprisoned for one and a half months in argun.</seg>
<seg id="2338">He says that many people have disappeared in this prison after their beard has grown.</seg>
<seg id="2339">There has been nothing new ever since.</seg>
<seg id="2340">They just took them along.</seg>
<seg id="2341">"and this so-called Lord, this person was there when these people were taken."</seg>
<seg id="2342">"until now, however, they were not presented as bandits, but there have been no reports about it yet. however, we suspect that such actions are possible."</seg>
<seg id="2343">Why would you not have allowed these people to shave?</seg>
<seg id="2344">Do you know if these persecutions and kidnappings of people who belong to so-called "non-traditional" orientation have already occurred in the past?</seg>
<seg id="2345">Sabrina: I've always wore my hair long.</seg>
<seg id="2346">In Chechnya I had a Bob.</seg>
<seg id="2347">"I think, already before 2003, I was already known all over Grosny when I was still living there - and I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2348">In Ernst!</seg>
<seg id="2349">"even from 1998 to 1999, when Sharia was considered, I never had any problems."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"on the contrary, it was much safer than now."</seg>
<seg id="2351">"Russia originally intended to lead us to" civilisation, "but ultimately thrown us back into the Stone Age."</seg>
<seg id="2352">OC Media: how is this possible under the Sharia law?</seg>
<seg id="2353">"Sabrina: my eyebrows were plucked; I had colored eyelashes, wore tubes jeans and short tops."</seg>
<seg id="2354">The Ministry of Safety of Sharia has never bent me on a hair.</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in front of the Russian theatre in Grosny there was a place where every evening, especially on weekends, a whole group of people met me."</seg>
<seg id="2356">"it was a small place where several banks stood, and the whole city knew about it; they knew why men, young people met there."</seg>
<seg id="2357">We have never been offended.</seg>
<seg id="2358">"in the Chechen language there is a saying:" "Kharda ma Kharda. that is," "Don't think about the misfortune of another." ""</seg>
<seg id="2359">They often say to children when they make fun of the sick.</seg>
<seg id="2360">"OC Media: so they just closed their eyes to you, because they believed you were ill?"</seg>
<seg id="2361">Sabrina: yes.</seg>
<seg id="2362">"they never insulted me, never hunted and never beaten."</seg>
<seg id="2363">OC Media: how long did this time of grace pause?</seg>
<seg id="2364">Sabrina: so long until Kadyrov stepped on the plan.</seg>
<seg id="2365">"when he was appointed Prime Minister in 2005, he began talking about morality on television."</seg>
<seg id="2366">"he spoke not about us per se, but above all about the behaviour of women."</seg>
<seg id="2367">"nevertheless, you could feel how people started to change in the city."</seg>
<seg id="2368">"those who had laughed and laughed before, looked at you at once with suspicion."</seg>
<seg id="2369">"in the meantime, I left Chechnya."</seg>
<seg id="2370">"but every time I came back home, I could feel how the situation in the republic grew steadily."</seg>
<seg id="2371">OC Media: what activity do you follow now?</seg>
<seg id="2372">Sabrina: I work as a waitress.</seg>
<seg id="2373">I don't earn much - 700 to 800 dollars a month are not much in the US.</seg>
<seg id="2374">"apart from that, I am still active as an activist."</seg>
<seg id="2375">Currently I am responsible for 15 Muslim women.</seg>
<seg id="2376">I communicate with them as a kind of psychologist.</seg>
<seg id="2377">"we organize teas, gatherings, I accompany them to the hospital and help them to get meal tickets."</seg>
<seg id="2378">I don't have a cent for it.</seg>
<seg id="2379">I have discovered these people themselves when I klapperte influx.</seg>
<seg id="2380">I am Muslims and I want to help those who need help.</seg>
<seg id="2381">OC Media: do you wear a Hidschab?</seg>
<seg id="2382">Sabrina: that is silly.</seg>
<seg id="2383">"so nature is, it has nothing to do with religion."</seg>
<seg id="2384">"this is exactly the same as echoes who want to make you white with foam before the mouth, that there are no bobbins with them."</seg>
<seg id="2385">"the Dagestan ones have what the cabardines have, the Russians also have which; on the whole planet they exist - but" not in Chechnya. ""</seg>
<seg id="2386">"I come from there, so it makes me uncomfortable to hear something like that."</seg>
<seg id="2387">I meet so many men from the Caucasus here.</seg>
<seg id="2388">Many of them - practicing Muslims who walk in the mosque and fasting during Ramadan - live together with men.</seg>
<seg id="2389">"you know, many think about the identity of men who love men, and they believe that one changes his sex to make more intimate experiences. but this is a fallacy."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"these are two different things - two different kinds of feeling, to be exact, different life attitudes."</seg>
<seg id="2391">For me it is the most important thing to feel in my own skin and not feel ashamed of my body.</seg>
<seg id="2392">Not whether I have a partner or not.</seg>
<seg id="2393">Sorry I'm going to be so personal here but my last intimate relationship is now longer than a year ago.</seg>
<seg id="2394">And I am not sad at all. I just know that I am now myself.</seg>
<seg id="2395">Local groups warn of an increase in suicide in the impoverished Arab Anawazi community in Iran</seg>
<seg id="2396">The Iranian territory suffers from an unusually high unemployment rate and poverty rate within the native Arab population.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"since the last few months, there has been a strong increase in suicide."</seg>

<seg id="2399">Photo: use with permission.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the self-combustion of a man named Jassim Moramazi on August 27 brought the desperate situation of the Arab Anawazi community in Iran, characterized by poverty and unemployment, into the spotlight."</seg>
<seg id="2401">Moramazi was married and had a child; he lived in Al-Thawra in the region of Ahwaz in the south-west of Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2402">"he suffered under anxiety, depression, and he was ashamed of his own helplessness, the inability for his family to be able to work in Ahwaz, who would like to remain anonymous."</seg>
<seg id="2403">A video shared on YouTube kept the moments after he lit up himself.</seg>
<seg id="2404">"some people quickly managed to extinguish the flames, and Moramazi was taken to Taleghani hospital in the city of Ahwaz."</seg>
<seg id="2405">"according to local sources, the burns were so strong that doctors could not do anything anymore."</seg>
<seg id="2406">He died a short time later.</seg>
<seg id="2407">"it was not the only suicide that occurred in August within the Arabic Ahwazi minority, and activists on the ground warn that even more men could take their lives."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"the Ahwazi Centre for Human Rights reported that this month some others - Hamid Maniat, Ali Hazbawi, Sayed Falah Moussawi and Shahab Bani Tamim."</seg>
<seg id="2409">"their stories have one thing in common: they were all family fathers, who felt helpless and unable to feed their families because of the persecution on the part of the Iranian government."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"Arab Ahwazi suffer from poverty, unemployment and discrimination"</seg>
<seg id="2411">"the region, where much of the Arab population living in Iran is based, has been shaken by a profound economic crisis that makes it hard for the native Arab population to make a living."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"a century ago, the Arab Anawaz was a predominantly autonomous region in Iran until the Pahlavi monarchy assumed power and made great efforts to end ethnic autonomy throughout Iran."</seg>
<seg id="2413">"in the Ahwaz region, there are some of the largest oil and gas fields occurring in Iran, as well as some of the most profitable and most valuable uses for Iranian agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2414">"despite these valuable resources, the regional economy continues to develop slowly, and the local population only gets little of this wealth."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"it is often a victim of untreated disease, famine and deprivation."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Iranian regime systematically denies the Ahwazi-Arabs in the local oil, gas and petrochemical industries."</seg>
<seg id="2417">"the government has also built a large number of dams, the waters of the Arab territories in the Persian countryside, where the provinces of Isfahan, Yazd, Kerman and Ghom lie."</seg>
<seg id="2418">"these dams have only led to aggravate the devastation caused in the region by dryness, and to destroy local agriculture as well as the fish and palm industry."</seg>
<seg id="2419">The unemployment rate among the Arab ahawzi-adolescents now increased to 81%.</seg>
<seg id="2420">"Nour Mohammed Pur, the Iranian general director for cooperatives, work and social welfare, reported that 5% of the Ahwazis who are looking for a job completed primary school, 55% have finished secondary school and 45% have a university degree."</seg>
<seg id="2421">A "systematic strategy... which aims to destroy the spirit of national resistance</seg>
<seg id="2422">"Karim Dohimi, a Iranian human rights activist with a resident in London, said Global Voices that the current situation, a mixture of" poverty, unemployment and racial ethnic discrimination, "leads to a" high rise "of the number of suicide among young Ahwazi men."</seg>
<seg id="2423">"for this reason, a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination in the recruitment process is a combination of a high number of ethnic Persians and an anti-Arab discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="2424">"since officials and institutions prefer not to employ Arab workers, the local Arab Ahwazi is deprived of access to employment opportunities in all sectors."</seg>
<seg id="2425">"this is part of a systematic policy of the ruling regime, aimed at destroying the spirit of national resistance of young Arabs and forcing them to earn their living outside of their homeland."</seg>
<seg id="2426">"there are people who had to change their first and last name to hide their belonging to the Ahwazi and to be hired as even Arabic names at the workplace are not tolerated, let alone speak of the Arabic language or wearing Arabian clothing."</seg>
<seg id="2427">"given the circumstances that the Arab Ahwazi has to endure, human rights activists beat alarm before the situation becomes explosive."</seg>
<seg id="2428">It remains to be seen whether the world is waking up and taking note of it.</seg>

<seg id="2433">"why I don't identify with feminism, nor with intersectional"</seg>
<seg id="2434">Detail of a photo. taken by: Pixabay. released under the CC0 Creative Commons License.</seg>
<seg id="2435">The following article is a revised version of the statement written by Ayomide Zuri and was originally published on the Afroféminas website.</seg>
<seg id="2436">You can read in the comments below the original text.</seg>
<seg id="2437">"when I say that I am not a feminist, many women - especially white women, who call themselves as intersectional feminists, react with frustration."</seg>
<seg id="2438">They wonder why I am not part of the movement.</seg>
<seg id="2439">They even put well thought out scientific and social arguments in front of me why I should be a feminist and why we should generally be all feminists * within.</seg>
<seg id="2440">"for example, women today still earn less money than men today despite equal education."</seg>
<seg id="2441">That women are still under strict observation when it comes to what they can do with their body.</seg>
<seg id="2442">That violence against women is a global epidemic.</seg>
<seg id="2443">"or that cultural and social norms still make sure that women face a glass ceiling earlier or later in various areas of life, and that discrimination based on gender is still moving across the many different countries and denominations."</seg>
<seg id="2444">All this is aware and well-known to me.</seg>
<seg id="2445">"I am convinced, and I suffer double and triple."</seg>
<seg id="2446">I am a black woman.</seg>
<seg id="2447">"and yet, when I come to speak on skin colour, on racism, on black women's women, black women in the LGBTIQ community or on black women from the Diaspora; if I mention how we have always been abused in racial separation and discrimination, both in and outside the feminist movement, many white feminists decide to remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2448">"but all agree that women - all women - should come together to" "lift up their voices" "and" "Kumbaya, my Lord," "to achieve equal rights (some) of women."</seg>
<seg id="2449">"but they don't want to talk about that, in addition to sexualised violence, there is an institutionalised form of racial-motivated violence that we are subjected to black women in two ways."</seg>
<seg id="2450">Or that black women and women of other ethnic groups and places of origin earn less than white men and women.</seg>
<seg id="2451">"that black girls and girls with a migration background often refer to school as white girls, due to obvious integration problems."</seg>
<seg id="2452">Or that women in black spheres and women with a migration background are exposed to a higher risk of suffering domestic violence and violence in partnership than white women.</seg>
<seg id="2453">"on the one hand, I want all women, all men and all men of any skin color to have the same rights; on the other hand, as a black woman, I cannot join a movement in whose centre the white woman stands, who refuses to take into account injustices in her thinking, which relate to both the sex and the skin color of a person."</seg>
<seg id="2454">"I am exhausted and will no longer fight for my membership in a white-feminist sphere, which has repeatedly rejected me and countless other black women."</seg>
<seg id="2455">"in 1851, Sojourner complained in her speech:" am I not a woman? "and I also refuse to maintain an ideology in which the black woman is in a historical sense a dehumanised and marginalized being."</seg>
<seg id="2456">"I refuse to join groups that also absorb our customs and customs by cultural appropriation, in order to expedite their egocentric programme."</seg>
<seg id="2457">"I will no longer try to suggest white women the importance of overlapping skin colour and gender, because some of them will continue to mention the importance of black women for feminist movement, no matter how many black women try to reward them for the better."</seg>
<seg id="2458">"although intersectional feminism was founded to give women different backgrounds a home and distinguish themselves from white feminism, still the word" feminism "is still in its name."</seg>
<seg id="2459">"I prefer to release myself completely from feminism and join the movement of womanism, which has been created for my dark skin and status as a woman, rather than engaging me for a white-feminist paradigm that is so persistent that intersectionality is celebrated as a novel phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2460">Now it is more important than ever that we define black women according to our own ideas and enter into the spheres that are created by us.</seg>
<seg id="2461">"Clenora Hudson-Weems, the author of the book Africana womanism: how we can defend ourselves) speaks of how we can defend ourselves by defining ourselves in our own way. and not only that - black women can also create spaces in which they can be totally safe and in which the cultural, spiritual, emotional, physical and even the spiritual elements can be worshipped that make up the black woman."</seg>
<seg id="2462">"although some white and intersectional feminists immediately call separatism and exclusion after reading these lines, I ask you to inform yourself of the hypocrisy and the contradictions of feminist movement, of which the black woman is affected."</seg>
<seg id="2463">"in a womanistic environment, I can lift black women and women from other cultures because in this paradigm I exist."</seg>
<seg id="2464">I am recognized as part of this paradigm because of my dark skin and because of my existence as a woman.</seg>
<seg id="2465">"I, a black woman, can flourish in an environment where my life has neither passed over nor ignored, nor rejected."</seg>
<seg id="2466">Paddling against pollution: a man's mission to protect rivers in Iraq for future generations</seg>
<seg id="2467">"this post by Todd Reubold was originally published on Ensia.com, a magazine that has recently reported on international efforts to solve environmental problems."</seg>
<seg id="2468">"as part of a content sharing agreement, this article will be published again."</seg>
<seg id="2469">"again and again, Nabil Musa travelled to Iraq in the past 7 years - mostly with surfboard or canoe - with a special concern for the Kurdistan Region in Iraq. his mission aims to make people aware of the importance of clean waters for present and future generations."</seg>
<seg id="2470">In this documentation of Emily Kinskey we follow Musa explaining his relationship with the rivers of the region and the impact of pollution to his community.</seg>
<seg id="2471">"I wanted to do something for the river that we had lost when I was still a child," "explains Musa."</seg>
<seg id="2472">"scientists from all over the country fear that the decades of war, the construction of dams, pollution and uncontrolled development will lead to an immediate water crisis in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="2473">"Musa is a member of the non-governmental organization Waterkeepers Iraq - a subsidiary of Waterkeeper Alliance - committed to protecting the rivers, streams and waterways in Iraq, as well as supporting local communities in the sustainable use of these natural resources."</seg>
<seg id="2474">"at the end of the video, Musa sums up the urgency and importance of his work in a matter:" if we had no water, how would we survive? "</seg>
<seg id="2475">"this video was produced, filmed and published for Ensia by Emily Kinskey, one in Erbil, Iraq-based documentary filmmaker and multimedia journalist."</seg>
<seg id="2476">"the main focus of her work lies on persecuted, poorly observed subcultures and is characterized by the use of cooperative videography and new multimedia techniques, whose help suppressed communities can tell their stories in their own way."</seg>

<seg id="2480">The following article is the shortened and edited version of the article "The Wave of Violence against Women in Paraguay" by cures. the article belongs to the series # PorserMujer (# nun-efactors) reported on the violence wave over women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2481">Most names have been changed to protect the affected persons.</seg>
<seg id="2482">"a police commissioner told Ada Báez that she could do nothing against Luis Balbuena, her ex-partner, who had become violent against her."</seg>
<seg id="2483">"since the end of her relationship a little time has gone and the police said that her statement would be placed on the acts, but more could not be done."</seg>
<seg id="2484">"when another woman showed Balbuena about abuse, the apparent ad of Ada Báez also used nothing."</seg>
<seg id="2485">"a few days later, the second woman withdrew her advertisement."</seg>
<seg id="2486">Breaking the vicious circle of violence against women is difficult.</seg>
<seg id="2487">"if women ever report an ad at all, they generally do not receive support from the State."</seg>
<seg id="2488">"in many cases, women are also financially dependent on the men they abuse. this also explains why only 20% of all women who admit to be victims of violence are at all reporting to the law enforcement authorities."</seg>
<seg id="2489">"contents 1 Beat and Statistical 2 Invisible abuse and a judicial system, which is nothing subdivided of Paraguay's laws: good approach, poor implementation of punches and statistics"</seg>
<seg id="2490">"it is hard to determine how many women are really mistreated, says Myrian González, researcher for gender issues at the Centro de Documentación y Estudios, a social scientific research institution in Paraguay."</seg>
<seg id="2491">"however, the available figures are alarming."</seg>
<seg id="2492">"in 2015, the District Attorney General opened 9600 advertisements for domestic violence. at 70% of it was violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="2493">86% of the ads at the police came from women.</seg>
<seg id="2494">There were more than 5000 ads because of domestic violence in the courts of peace. 86% of women's ads came here as well.</seg>
<seg id="2495">"in the advertisements, 40% of women said they were physically abused, 55% of women spoke of mental abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2496">But these statistics do not show the true extent of violence against women in Paraguay.</seg>
<seg id="2497">"according to the Paraguayan women's minister Ana Baiardi, only a few of these crimes are actually shown." "to every woman in Paraguay for psychological abuse notification, 9 women who do not do so."</seg>
<seg id="2498">"on every woman who is refunded because of physical abuse, two women who do not do this," "she stated at the end of 2014."</seg>
<seg id="2499">"since the murder of women in Paraguay is not an individual criminal record, the law enforcement authorities cannot adequately document how many women are murdered each year by their current or former partners."</seg>
<seg id="2500">"by August 2016 alone, journalists numbered at least 12 cases of women's murder in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2501">The coordinator for human rights in Paraguay has documented at least 37 cases where women were murdered by their current or former partners.</seg>
<seg id="2502">"according to their estimates, in Paraguay, every ten days a woman dies because of violence through men."</seg>
<seg id="2503">A sign with the inscription: "without complicity there is no impunity. # Nononess" Photo by Jessie Insfran Pérez. use with kind permission.</seg>
<seg id="2504">"invisible mistreatment and a judicial system, which does not undermine"</seg>
<seg id="2505">"before Mariana Brítez became the firm friend of Carlos Vera, he insisted that she named him the names of all her former friends."</seg>
<seg id="2506">"in the beginning, she didn't want to do that, but after that she was supposed to regret it."</seg>
<seg id="2507">"today Mariana is 28 years old and no longer met with Carlos, but for two years she endured psychic violence - one of the most common forms of violence against women and at the same time the most difficult to recognise:"</seg>
<seg id="2508">I never thought I would become a victim of abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2509">"when I read about it earlier, I always thought that it just happened to women who are too submissive because they are deceived by violent men."</seg>
<seg id="2510">I was convinced that this would never happen to me.</seg>
<seg id="2511">Mariana used social media to report about the abuse by Carlos Vera.</seg>
<seg id="2512">"without naming names, she wrote articles on Facebook, describing his insults and various attacks during her two-year relationship and told how he had isolated her."</seg>
<seg id="2513">"many people responded to their posts, including Carlos himself. he asked rhetorical whether he ever raised his hand against them and refused to admit that his behaviour was also a form of abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2514">"other Facebook users asked Mariana, why she had liked the so long of Carlos and did not leave it earlier."</seg>
<seg id="2515">It seemed almost like they wanted to say that victims of abuse had at least some complicity in it.</seg>
<seg id="2516">"Victoria Santos, which is not from Paraguay, fought for almost eight years with the authorities in Paraguay to prove that her former partner was mistreated."</seg>
<seg id="2517">Victoria is a member of the network Yo te Creo ("I believe you") consisting of women who are all victims of abuse in any way.</seg>
<seg id="2518">"in the group, they can talk to others about their experiences, listen to each other and support each other."</seg>
<seg id="2519">They do what many others do not do: they take the statements of women seriously.</seg>
<seg id="2520">In Victoria's case everything started with psychic abuse.</seg>
<seg id="2521">Her affluent partner eventually managed to convince her that she was worthless.</seg>
<seg id="2522">Then he began beating them.</seg>
<seg id="2523">"Victoria's advertisements with the authorities remained without result and also from their relatives, they did not receive any support."</seg>
<seg id="2524">"she led a process against her former partner, who developed into an impermeable legal battle between Paraguay and her home country, in which it was mainly about money, power and the influence of her former partner."</seg>
<seg id="2525">"Paraguay's laws: good approach, poor implementation"</seg>
<seg id="2526">"in Paraguay there are many laws that are very good, but not applied."</seg>
<seg id="2527">"" "the announcement of abuse is a way full of resistance and a fight against corruption in the judiciary," "says Victoria Santos."</seg>
<seg id="2528">"Carmen Echauri, a representative of the UN organization for women in Paraguay, also sees great problems in applying the laws in the country."</seg>
<seg id="2529">"on 10 August 2016, a bill was discussed in the Paraguayan Parliament, known under the hashtag # PorEllas (# for Her)."</seg>
<seg id="2530">This hashtag and the Movement # NiUnaMenos (# Nononess) are part of a Twitter campaign supported by Amnesty International.</seg>
<seg id="2531">The original draft of the law foresees femicides to declare and punish femicides as it is already the case in neighbouring countries Argentina and Bolivia.</seg>
<seg id="2532">"thus, the wording of the law was altered in some respects, in order to also gain the deputies of the law that feared that the way for decriminalisation of abortions was denied, which are generally forbidden in Paraguay and to be punished with up to five years in prison."</seg>
<seg id="2533">"the original bill envisaged the majority of the (bureaucratic and economic) procedural costs that the victims of violence currently have to bear, if they just repay and receive a secure accommodation to impose the state."</seg>

<seg id="2588">"medical research in Africa is rarely mentioned in the media, but it is a growing area that addresses one of the most urgent needs of the continent."</seg>
<seg id="2589">"there are two reasons for the need for medical research carried out on site: on the one hand, there are many medicines and vaccines that cover the special medical need on the African continent."</seg>
<seg id="2590">"diseases such as AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria have a far more serious impact in the poorest countries of Africa than elsewhere, and lack of investment for researching these diseases by pharmaceutical companies is a big problem."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"second, research carried out by African scientists is helping to build up own research capacities in Africa. a greater role in science and technology can only be conducive to the economic growth of the continent."</seg>

<seg id="2627">From the USA to India: how "open source" seed producers change global food production</seg>
<seg id="2628">"Rachel Cernansky's contribution was originally published on the website Ensia.com, a magazine reported on solutions for environmental issues around the world."</seg>
<seg id="2629">Frank Morton has been breeding salads in the USA since the 1980s.</seg>
<seg id="2630">"its company offers 114 varieties, such as Outredressing, the first plant grown and consumed by NASA astronauts in space."</seg>
<seg id="2631">"for almost 20 years, Morton's work was limited only by its own ingenuity and the question of how many salads he can get."</seg>
<seg id="2632">But at the beginning of the 2000 he noticed that more and more salads were patented and that he could not use it for breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2633">"the patents are not only for individual varieties, but also for certain properties such as resistance to diseases, a special red or green tone or crimped leaves."</seg>
<seg id="2634">"in recent years, more and more such patents have been applied to more and more plants such as cereal or carrot varieties. due to this trend, plant breeders, environmentalists and experts ensure food security for the future of food production."</seg>
<seg id="2635">"as a passionate representative of a millennia-old tradition, Morton still breeds lettuce, but now it needs longer because his work becomes more and more difficult due to more and more restrictions."</seg>
<seg id="2636">It is as if in a river a boulder is lying around which I have to yodel.</seg>
<seg id="2637">"so we have to do it now, but it's a break with the breeding tradition," he says. "I think these patents go far too far on salads."</seg>
<seg id="2638">"and if they stand before judgment, no one can breed a new salad type because all features have already been patented."</seg>
<seg id="2639">"however, it is very cautious and endeavours to not use material that is protected as intellectual property."</seg>
<seg id="2640">He also joined a movement that is growing ever greater in the USA and everywhere in the world: open Source Breeding ("Open Source" breeding).</seg>
<seg id="2641">"astronauts of the International Space Station ISS have bred and eaten red Roman lettuce of the variety" "greenhouse" "of the station. there it is tested whether plants can be grown in space."</seg>
<seg id="2642">Photo: NASA</seg>
<seg id="2643">It is no coincidence that this name sounds rather like the movement from the IT area and not from the field of plant breeding.</seg>
<seg id="2644">"the Open Source Seed Initiative (initiative for" Open Source "seed) is inspired by the movement for free" open source "software, which provides alternatives to copyrighted software."</seg>
<seg id="2645">It has been launched to ensure that some plant species and genes are not protected as intellectual property and thus can be used permanently for plant breeders.</seg>
<seg id="2646">"as part of the initiative, known as Ossi, US breeders can commit themselves to free use of the seeds bred by them."</seg>
<seg id="2647">"however, this does not mean that they will not continue to do business with their seeds and sell it." open Source "breeders are merely allowing others who buy seeds to breed their own varieties, and not immediately sow - two aspects that are banned or prescribed by many plant patents."</seg>
<seg id="2648">Dozens of breeders and seed companies have already joined the initiative since its launch in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="2649">Gloomy outlook</seg>
<seg id="2650">"for the professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Ossi Board member Jack Kloppenburg, control over the seed and the possibility of breeding new plants is important for food security and environmental protection."</seg>
<seg id="2651">"therefore seed plays a role in larger contexts such as biodiversity, farmers' rights, control over the food system and the use of chemicals in agriculture. independent breeders would try to use the latter not or only little by breeding seed with natural resistance."</seg>
<seg id="2652">Kloppenburg stresses that the "open source" movement does not concern genetically modified plants.</seg>
<seg id="2653">"all types of plants could be patented, whether vegetables, grain, genetically modified or not, from ecological agriculture or not." to achieve our goal of ecological sustainability, we need control over the seed, "he says, and takes on the increasingly common mergers in the global agricultural industry, as is the case for example in farmers markets, should also know that the way this vegetables are bred is threatened."</seg>
<seg id="2654">Food sovereignty without sovereignty is not possible. "</seg>
<seg id="2655">"the members of the Open Source Seed Initiative are committed to remaining freely available to others, in contrast to seed and plant characteristics."</seg>
<seg id="2656">Photo by Jack Kloppenburg.</seg>
<seg id="2657">"Ossi supporters argue that the future of food supply is at risk, as the available gene pool is constantly shrinking due to the increasingly numerous intellectual property rights on plant material that is therefore always restricted."</seg>
<seg id="2658">"Claire Luby, executive director of Ossi, has engaged in her PhD thesis with genetic variation in carrots and their availability. she found out that around a third of all carrot characteristics are protected as intellectual property, making it difficult for plant breeders to use either at all."</seg>
<seg id="2659">"there are still no such estimates for other plants yet, but experts such as Luby assume that mass cultivated plants such as wheat are patented in even greater style than lettuce or carrots."</seg>
<seg id="2660">A question of view</seg>
<seg id="2661">"plants are bred in such a way that they have specifically desired traits - from such, through which their taste or colour is improved to such, because of which they thrive in certain environments and withstand threats such as pests or diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2662">"opponents of patents on plant properties indicate that the available plant material for breeders is decreasing by more and more patents. at present, genetic diversity is more necessary than ever since the changed conditions by climate change are far less predictable."</seg>
<seg id="2663">"in an e-mail, Monsanto-Speaker Carly Scaduto acknowledges that genetic diversity is generally important and also crucial for Monsanto's activities. with a total of four gene banks and cooperation with institutions such as the Department of Agriculture of the United States, the company is committed to the conservation of genetic diversity."</seg>
<seg id="2664">"however, it contradicts the view that intellectual property is owned by other breeders, as patents and the protection of plant varieties promote innovation." "a patent is basically a plan that everyone can follow as soon as the patent expired."</seg>
<seg id="2665">Often these instructions help others to get the same result with another method.</seg>
<seg id="2666">"such protection does not inhibit innovation, but encourages them by providing the public with more material and know-how."</seg>
<seg id="2667">"Morton sees this differently: 20 years of waiting until a patent expires, certainly not promoting innovations."</seg>
<seg id="2668">"and if you have to wait so long to breed plants adapted to the changing environmental conditions, you should have lost the fight."</seg>
<seg id="2669">"however, the main argument for Morton is that genetic resources have always been common good and should continue to remain:" independent plant breeders have neither time nor money for such formalities, and monetary incentives are not attractive to us. "</seg>
<seg id="2670">We want farmers to make their work easier.</seg>
<seg id="2671">"this is what drives us, and it becomes impossible for us to continue to use the best and most recent genetic resources."</seg>
<seg id="2672">"overall, Morton is interfering with the concept of patenting plant-characteristics:" we do not really create the characteristics themselves. "</seg>
<seg id="2673">The plants themselves form them and as breeders we have no idea how the plants do that.</seg>
<seg id="2674">A secret of nature. "</seg>
<seg id="2675">"for Carol Deppe, plant breeder in Oregon and Ossi board member, there is another important aspect of plant breeding:" those who breed a variety also breed their own values into it. "</seg>
<seg id="2676">"those who believe in industrial agriculture with large farms and monocultures, for their cultivation, are required to produce a mass of herbicides, which breeds in its varieties this concept of agriculture."</seg>
<seg id="2677">My concept is exactly opposite. "</seg>
<seg id="2678">"while some medium-sized enterprises (such that move on international markets, but smaller than Monsanto) possess patents, they manage most of the smaller seed companies, even without patents to survive - either they reject the patent or they consider it too expensive and therefore not rewarding or both is the case."</seg>
<seg id="2679">The independent plant breeder Frank Morton looks for Salate in his breeding garden.</seg>
<seg id="2680">Photo by Karen Morton.</seg>
<seg id="2681">"in addition, Morton believes that through avoiding plant patents, breeders would be more innovative:" it looks like I am working with my efforts to produce something new, stronger than companies that patent. "</seg>
<seg id="2682">"I constantly need new material for my catalogue, as I know that my competitors will sell my varieties in a few years," he says. "with a patent it is protected for 20 years before competition, with which I think it is quite easy." worldwide resonance "</seg>
<seg id="2683">"although the US seems to be leading in the open source breeding, the concept is now spreading rapidly all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"in India, the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture introduces itself as a professional organization in the field of resources, an" open source "seed programme. for the preservation of the seeds of traditional crops, the centre works with farmers and helps them to breed new varieties that meet certain requirements."</seg>
<seg id="2685">It also supports them to come to "Open Source" seeds and sell their own.</seg>
<seg id="2686">"the German Organisation Agrecol works on an" open-source "licence, which is ultimately a formal and legally binding form of the Ossi commitment to breeders in the European Union."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"(provisions for breeding differ from country to country, so the Ossi obligation cannot simply be taken over one to one in Europe or other parts of the world.)"</seg>
<seg id="2688">"at the beginning of November 2016, the executive of the European Union, the European Commission, declared that conventionally bred plants should not be patentable."</seg>
<seg id="2689">"however, an explanation is not a law; now it is up to the member states' governments to apply the Patent Office to implement this new line."</seg>
<seg id="2690">"in October 2016, the Dutch organization Hivos organized a conference on" Open Source "seed systems in Ethiopia where farmers, operators of seed banks and representatives of governments, NGOs and seed companies from all East Africa gathered to learn about the" open source "seed movement and the worldwide trend towards the patenting of seeds."</seg>
<seg id="2691">"Willy Douma, responsible for Hivos' programme for" Open Source "seed systems, explains that the organisation is currently building a worldwide alliance for" open source "seed systems, which will be the official start of the official launch next year."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"an association consisting of environmental and development aid groups (including Hivos, the international non-profit-development organisation USC Canada and the action group on erosion, technology and concentration) has put together a database on seed and biodiversity around the world to publish the Seed Map Project, a seed map."</seg>
<seg id="2693">"in September, the Global Alliance for the Future of Food, the global alliance for the future of food - has published a report from relief organisations such as the WK Kellogg Foundation, the McKnight Foundation and others."</seg>
<seg id="2694">"the report also highlights the importance of a diverse local supply of seed for sustainable food systems - a context, from the Luby of Ossi hopes that more people will soon recognize it."</seg>
<seg id="2695">"the movement for regional and ecological food has, above all, taken care of where and how something is cultivated, and seed systems have hardly played a role here," said Luby. "we are now trying to make people realize that there is even more behind their food."</seg>

<seg id="2729">Ziada took advantage of his blog for the dissemination of columns and articles that he writes in Egypt not accessible websites and media.</seg>

<seg id="2731">"blogger, the provider of which also Ziadas blog is given a home, on the other hand, is further accessible."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"Ziada, a former photojournalist, spent nearly 500 days in captivity after he was arrested by Egyptian security forces in December 2013, while he reported on the student protests and recorded a video how the police performed physical violence against two students."</seg>
<seg id="2733">His articles revolve primarily around politics and the human rights situation in Egypt.</seg>
<seg id="2734">"in a Facebook comment, Ziada commented on the government and reflected what it means to him:"</seg>
<seg id="2735">"blocking blogs is very old, but has priority in the era of Abdelfattah al-Sisi; and even if the blocking of the blog might not be significant for the world, it is for me for two reasons:"</seg>
<seg id="2736">"I have managed to convey a state of siege to me; arrest, attempted murder, summons from the National Security Council, blocking blogs as well as any other website for which I worked."</seg>
<seg id="2737">"2) You have proved that I did not write in vain. in other words, my words have influence, even though only a small audience."</seg>
<seg id="2738">I would like to mention that this blog was an archive for me.</seg>
<seg id="2739">"first, I used it to post articles to circumvent censorship."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"but now, after they have locked him and that they are afraid of words, I can still change the link or create a second blog."</seg>
<seg id="2741">The brave people go the way to the end.</seg>
<seg id="2742">"according to the Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Association for Freedom of Thought and Expression (afte) Egyptian authorities blocked 133 websites from 24 May to 6 August. this gave technical tests on networks of various Internet Service Providers (ISP), among others Orange, Vodafone and Etisalat."</seg>
<seg id="2743">"there was also documented the blocking of providers, possible through the circumvention of Internet censorship and private surfing, so-called Virtual Private Networks (VPNs)"</seg>
<seg id="2744">She reported in her research:</seg>
<seg id="2745">"on Monday, June 12, we noticed how the blocking of websites offering VPNs began."</seg>
<seg id="2746">This kind of practice points to the government's intention to continue to block and filter content to which Egyptian users might have access.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the situation is additionally exacerbated by the fact that the censorship decisions are made behind closed doors, whereby the Egyptian population has no legal basis by which they can proceed against these actions."</seg>

<seg id="2749">Is Rio de Janeiro in war?</seg>

<seg id="2752">"photo by: Estado Maior (CML) via photos Públicas, CC-BY-NC 2.0"</seg>
<seg id="2753">"day by day newspapers report in Brazil with more dark headlines from Rio de Janeiro, the second largest city in the country and home to numerous postcard motifs."</seg>
<seg id="2754">Some of these headlines are as follows:</seg>
<seg id="2755">"14-year-old shot at school," "Every second day a police officer in Rio de Janeiro is murdered," "Diebe smokes dispensary with military weapons," "President Temer sends 8500 soldiers of the army, navy and airwaves to Rio."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the midst of the economic crisis and in a tense financial situation, the wave of violence in Rio in 2017 reached the highest level for 10 years."</seg>
<seg id="2757">The Brazilian non-governmental organisation Global Justice called even the United Nations to intervene.</seg>
<seg id="2758">Reports like these have become everyday and this is unacceptable and # 8212; at least find the managers of a local newspaper.</seg>
<seg id="2759">"in this way, the newspaper" Extra "published in Rio for the detailed coverage of violence in Rio published the editorial" This is not normal "in which it announced a new category called" War in Rio. ""</seg>
<seg id="2760">All reports on violence in the city are now published there.</seg>
<seg id="2761">The newspaper explained the motives for their decision:</seg>
<seg id="2762">"it will continue to report about crimes that happen in every major city in the world such as murder, robbery, sex crime etc. everything, however, differs from the civilized standard and what happens only in Rio will be published in the category" War in Rio. "(...) This is our way of calling: this is not normal!"</seg>
<seg id="2763">This is the only alternative so that we as journalists don't close our eyes to cruelty.</seg>
<seg id="2764">"in a four minute video shared on Facebook, Octávio Guedes, editor-in-chief of the newspaper, said that this decision was not a cause for pride, but rather a sign of failure:"</seg>
<seg id="2765">It is probably the only newspaper in the world with a war rubrik in a country that does not recognize the war.</seg>
<seg id="2766">"the same video explains a journalist from the newspaper that according to the Institute of Internal Security in Rio de Janeiro, there are 843 areas controlled by criminal organisations."</seg>
<seg id="2767">"in the editorial, the newspaper continues to write:"</seg>
<seg id="2768">"we are aware that a war discourse, when it is distorted, can also be used to disguise the atrocities of the police who first shoot and then ask questions."</seg>
<seg id="2769">"but we defend the war based on information and the fight against corruption in the police, whose aim is not the civilian population, but the economic power of the Mafia and its partners."</seg>
<seg id="2770">Does the term "war" harm more than it benefits?</seg>
<seg id="2771">"in an article on the news portal The Intercept Brasil, journalist Cecília Oliveira argues that violence as a" war "is arguing."</seg>
<seg id="2772">This is not a war.</seg>
<seg id="2773">"this is the result of corruption and poor planning - as it has shown in the analysis of military operations in Rio itself - in combination with insufficient investment in personnel, education and a historical and complacent neglect of the public sector."</seg>

<seg id="2782">"in the beginning, this actually led to a decrease of forcible deaths. however, after several years, the UPP was increasingly under bombardment after several reports of chicans and repressions against the poor communities, which should actually protect the newly created police unit."</seg>
<seg id="2783">"on his Facebook page, the journalist João Paulo Charleaux quoted from one of his articles in 2010, explaining why violence in Rio does not comply with the criteria for the term" civil war "by the Geneva Convention."</seg>
<seg id="2784">He writes:</seg>
<seg id="2785">"in addition to legal issues, the classification of the situation in Rio as war also involves serious consequences for the people."</seg>
<seg id="2786">"this requires the state to use means and methods that are typical of a war. this includes penetration into the territory of a" enemy, "in which civil society is an unsharp point in the landscape and becomes the object of" collateral damage "and" lost bullets. ""</seg>

<seg id="2802">"since the beginning of the Syrian revolution in 2011 and the subsequent civil war, many Syrian cities suffer brutal siege and blockades, mainly by the Assad regime against loyal troops."</seg>
<seg id="2803">"according to victories Watch, a joint initiative of the peace organization PAX and the research institute The Syria Institute, there are currently around one million Syrians in a state of siege in Damascus and surrounding land, Homs, Deir Ezzor and Idlib."</seg>
<seg id="2804">"the region of East Ghouta is particularly heavily affected, where an attack with chemical weapons on 21 August 2013 called for the lives of hundreds of civilians."</seg>
<seg id="2805">"many governments, international organizations and the Syrian opposition are based on investigations by the United Nations and other human rights organisations that the massacre of the Assad regime has been committed."</seg>
<seg id="2806">"since 2013, these rebels controlled areas outside Damascus have been under siege, leading to the fact that local residents are dependent on locally produced or smuggled food through tunnels and control points."</seg>
<seg id="2807">"due to the years of blockade, traditional foods such as meat have become unattainable for large parts of the population."</seg>
<seg id="2808">"as a counter-measure, a group of Syrian humanitarian workers and academics will teach the inhabitants of East Ghoutas, how they can plant their own mushrooms as a" life-saving food source. ""</seg>
<seg id="2809">They call themselves Ghira Alnahda and carry out the project together with the NGO Al Adala.</seg>
<seg id="2810">Mushrooms do not belong to the traditional foods cultivated in Syria and are rarely part of the Syrian kitchen. however their food makes them an attractive source of food for many residents of the besieged East Ghouta.</seg>
<seg id="2811">"the project, Abo Nabil, said to the French news agency AFP:"</seg>
<seg id="2812">"we decided to cultivate mushrooms, because they have a high nutritional value, similar to meat, and because they can plant them in houses and cellars."</seg>
<seg id="2813">"Dr. Ahmed Leila, one of the organizers, reports Global Voices that for three years it has been fighting to announce this project and expressed his relief that it now wins more and more."</seg>
<seg id="2814">"to raise money for the initiative, in consultation with the NGO Ghiras Alnahda, the humanitarian crowdfunding platform CanDo can be used."</seg>
<seg id="2815">"it is planned to convey 125 families of knowledge about planting mushrooms, so Dr. Leila becomes Global Voices."</seg>
<seg id="2816">"at the time of the constitution of this article, they have reached over 100% of their expected target of around 12,700 €, but will continue to collect donations to CanDo until Monday, 4 September 2017."</seg>
<seg id="2817">The initiative depends on generators that keep the temperature stable at 25 ° C and humidity at 80%.</seg>
<seg id="2818">"because of the fuel shortage, locally produced fuels are used in plastic to supply the generators with the necessary energy."</seg>
<seg id="2819">"Dr. Leila said to Global Voices that they began with the" "production of mushrooms from regions" "before they checked their quality and whether they are suitable for consumption."</seg>
<seg id="2820">"then they planted a small mushroom farm in a tub. when this succeeded, they used a larger tub. and so on."</seg>
<seg id="2821">Now they have created a "educational farm for the region."</seg>
<seg id="2822">Since the beginning of the project and after another 3 months they have distributed mushrooms everywhere in East Ghouta free of charge.</seg>
<seg id="2823">Dr. Leila explained that it is part of a larger movement.</seg>
<seg id="2824">"" "we want to teach the people the mushroom cultivation for various reasons" ": breach of the siege."</seg>
<seg id="2825">Providing a new food source on the market.</seg>

<seg id="2833">"on 21 October, several hundred people protested in many districts in Portugal and demanded justice for the victims of the fires that were rampant in the north of Portugal."</seg>
<seg id="2834">Forty-two persons died and some 70 were injured as a result of the fires of 15 and 16 October. this led to the government last week calling for solidarity with the victims for 3 days.</seg>
<seg id="2835">"fires have also been registered in the Galicia region, where there were 4 dead."</seg>
<seg id="2836">"it is estimated that there were more than 500 fire outbreaks, spread out in the northern and central regions of the country and about 250 million hectares of forest and numerous villages."</seg>
<seg id="2837">"in June, a similar tragedy happened in Pedrógão Grande, where there were 64 deaths and more than 200 injured."</seg>
<seg id="2838">"according to the European forest monitoring system, which monitors the forest areas by satellite imagery, around 500,000 acres of forest are burned in Portugal alone in 2017 - an area of the size of the Lisbon district."</seg>

<seg id="2875">"at that time, Asharaf Barati, a 13-year-old boy who belonged to the ethnic group of Hazara, was in the province of Ghazni in central Afghanistan for the last time with his family at dinner together."</seg>

<seg id="2886">Many Hazara left the country towards Pakistan or Iran.</seg>
<seg id="2887">"a few days after his escape, Asharaf found himself in Pakistan again."</seg>
<seg id="2888">"for a couple of years, he worked in a cohort. the work was heavy and made him ill."</seg>
<seg id="2889">"once again he was in a foreign country together with other refugees and dragged bags with mortar, which were heavier than he himself, in order to earn his living."</seg>
<seg id="2890">"back then, as today, the life of Afghan refugees in Iran was marked by poverty and exploitation."</seg>
<seg id="2891">"it was really hard," "remembered Asharaf in an interview with Global Voices." "we (Afghan refugees) lived in an empty building on the building site where we worked."</seg>
<seg id="2892">There was no service and no heating. we hung nylon in front of the open windows so that we did not freeze at night.</seg>
<seg id="2893">"after four years, Asharaf left his life without papers in Iran and was ready to travel to Europe."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"during the dangerous crossing on the sea, he suffered shipwreck and stranded on a small, uninhabited Greek island."</seg>
<seg id="2895">"after the Greek authorities rejected his asylum application, Asharaf came to Italy in 2002."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"some time ago Asharaf was homeless, running alone through the streets of Rome, slept in parks and went to a church that distributed food to needy people twice a day."</seg>
<seg id="2897">"true, Italy is a kind of second chance for rejected asylum seekers due to relatively high quotas. it is true, however, that the conditions that asylum seekers find in the country are catastrophic."</seg>
<seg id="2898">The human rights organisation Civil Liberties Union for Europe writes that the system "suffers from a general lack of transparency.</seg>
<seg id="2899">"the vast majority of asylum seekers are accommodated in the more than 3000" "special recording centres". "these are improvised facilities in the hands of unqualified and untrained personnel."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"according to the Italian law, asylum seekers can only be assigned to a reception centre if they have officially submitted an application for asylum - which can take months after the registration of the asylum application."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"until then, people who do not have money for accommodation have either relied on the hospitality of friends or have to sleep on the street."</seg>
<seg id="2902">So there was also Asharaf.</seg>

<seg id="2914">"for many of them, the country is a transitional solution on the way to other European countries."</seg>
<seg id="2915">"in recent years, some of the Afghans operated, including tailor shops, travel agencies, hotels and restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="2916">Some Afghan restaurants were even praised in the Italian press for their excellent cuisine.</seg>
