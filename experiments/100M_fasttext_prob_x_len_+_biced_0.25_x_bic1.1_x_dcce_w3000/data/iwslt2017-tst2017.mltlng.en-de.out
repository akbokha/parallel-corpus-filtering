that is James R@@ isen .
you may know him because he won the Pul@@ itzer Prize as a New York Times re@@ porter .
&quot; long before anyone heard of Edward Snow@@ den , R@@ isen wrote a book in which he published spectac@@ ul@@ arly that the N@@ SA has illeg@@ ally listened to phones of Americans . &quot;
but it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression .
&quot; in this he describes a cat@@ astrop@@ hic US intelligence operation , in which the CIA delivered literally dra@@ fts for an atomic bomb . &quot;
&quot; if that sounds crazy , read it . &quot;
it is an incredible story .
but do you know who did not like the chapter ?
the U.S. government .
&quot; for almost 10 years , the government has determined against R@@ isen and called upon him to call his alleged sources . &quot;
&quot; in this train , he became a symbol of the government &apos;s pattern of condem@@ ning whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower and spy on journalists . &quot;
&quot; according to the First Trial Chamber , the media have the right to publish confidential information . &quot;
but it is impossible to apply this right when media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they are revealing .
&quot; so when the government kno@@ cked at R@@ isen , he did something that many courageous re@@ porters were doing before him : he refused and said he would rather go to prison . &quot;
&quot; from 2007 to 2015 , R@@ isen therefore lived with the risk to go to prison . &quot;
&quot; but then , just days before the trial , something extraordinary happened . &quot;
&quot; suddenly , even though they claim for years that it was essential for their case , the demands of the government were dropped to R@@ isen . &quot;
the reason : in the time of electronic surveillance the re@@ porters and sources can hide themselves less and less .
&quot; instead of separ@@ ators and R@@ isen to make statements , they could also do his digital foot@@ prints for him . &quot;
&quot; and so the investig@@ ators , without his consent , secretly app@@ reh@@ end his telephone numbers , &quot;
&quot; just like his email data , financial and banking information , his credit , and even travel tips with the list of his flights . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of this information , they found evidence they used to condemn Jeff@@ rey Sterling , a CIA W@@ hist@@ leb@@ lower and Ris@@ ens supposed source . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , this is only one of many cases . &quot;
&quot; President Obama promised to protect whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower , but instead the judi@@ ci@@ ary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him . &quot;
&quot; now you can imagine how this can be a problem , especially because the government classi@@ fies too much of its work as a secret . &quot;
&quot; since September 11 , almost every article on national security was the result of a whi@@ st@@ leb@@ lower went to a journalist . &quot;
&quot; so we put the press work on the game , which is to be protected by the first constitution , because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all . &quot;
&quot; but just as the government &apos;s technology allows to circum@@ vent the rights of re@@ porters , the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources . &quot;
&quot; they can do it from the moment they contact , rather than in hind@@ sight , in the witness stand . &quot;
&quot; today there are communication software , which has not yet been published when R@@ isen had written his book , and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls . &quot;
&quot; such technology is Sec@@ ure@@ Drop , an open source transmission system for whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers , which was originally developed by the Internet @-@ famous Aaron Swar@@ tz , and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation , at which I am working . &quot;
&quot; instead of sending an email , go to a news website , just like the Washington Post . &quot;
&quot; there you can upload or send documents , just as with any common contact form . &quot;
&quot; these are then encrypted and stored on a server , to which only the respective news agency has access . &quot;
&quot; so the government can no longer collect information secretly , and many of the information that it would request would not be available from the outset . &quot;
but Sec@@ ure@@ Drop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century .
&quot; unfortunately , governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that end@@ anger us all . &quot;
&quot; it is important to us to ensure that not only techn@@ ologists such as Edward Snow@@ den have a possibility to reveal their mis@@ deeds . it is just as important that we protect the next whi@@ stle @-@ blo@@ wers , &quot;
or the nearest environment workers who alarm the contaminated water of Flin@@ t . or a Wall@@ street @-@ In@@ sider that warns us of the next financial crisis .
&quot; after all , these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes , but to protect our all constitutional rights . &quot;
thank you .
&#91; what does this mean ? &#93; &#91; we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we asked Robert Pal@@ mer of Global Wit@@ ness for an explanation . &#93; This week we were sent from news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama @-@ based law firm Mos@@ aken Fon@@ sec@@ a .
the publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; we get an impression of how customers , banks and lawyers go to companies like Mos@@ bag Fon@@ sec@@ a and say : &quot; okay , we need an anonymous company . can you set up that ? &quot;
&quot; we actually see the e @-@ mails , the exchange of messages , how the whole system works as it works . &quot;
this has led to very direct consequences .
the Prime Minister of Iceland has res@@ igned .
there are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dict@@ ator Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad has in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars is leading to Russian President Vladimir Putin , about a close friend of children &apos;s days , a famous cel@@ lists . &quot;
&quot; now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nerv@@ ously for the next release , and on the next revealed documents . &quot;
now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John @-@ Gr@@ is@@ ham @-@ novel .
&quot; it seems crying away from you , me , ordinary people . &quot;
why should this happen to us ?
&quot; but the truth is : if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens and not all pay their taxes , this means less money for important public services such as health care , education , roads . &quot;
and that concerns us all .
&quot; for my organization , Global Wit@@ ness , these revelations are phenom@@ enal . &quot;
&quot; all over the world , media and leaders discuss how secret tax ha@@ v@@ ens are used by some few to hide and disgu@@ ise their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and expos@@ ing for ten years . &quot;
&quot; I think many people seem to be very conf@@ using this whole world , and it is hard to understand how these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work . &quot;
I always imagine it like a Mat@@ ry@@ jo@@ sch@@ kap@@ u@@ ppe .
&quot; so you have a company in another company , in another company , which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind those buildings . &quot;
&quot; it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities , as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is . &quot;
I find it also interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the United States .
&quot; probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who were in such revelations , this sc@@ andal . &quot;
now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax ha@@ v@@ ens .
&quot; but by the principle that these tax ha@@ v@@ ens work , Mos@@ aken Fon@@ sec@@ a has less American customers . &quot;
&quot; if we had a data le@@ ck from the Cay@@ man Islands or even from Del@@ aware , Wy@@ oming or Nevada , we would see a lot more cases and examples that have links to the USA . &quot;
&quot; in fact , in some US states , less information needs to be provided to form a company than to obtain a library card . &quot;
this type of in@@ transparency in the USA allowed employees of school districts to rip school children .
sc@@ amm@@ ers are allowed to rip off especially vulnerable investors .
it is this kind of behavior that affects all of us .
here at Global Wit@@ ness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice .
how does it work ?
so we sent a hidden investig@@ ator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan .
&quot; our investig@@ ator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring suspi@@ cious money to the USA to buy a house , a yacht , a private jet . &quot;
we really shocked the fact that everyone up to a lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer his money .
&quot; none of these lawyers took us as clients , and of course nobody was given money to anybody . however , it shows the problem with this system . &quot;
it is also important not to consider this as an individual case .
it is not a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our secret investig@@ ator .
it &apos;s not about a single leading politi@@ cian involved in sc@@ andal .
&quot; it is about how the system works , through corruption , tax ev@@ asion , poverty and inst@@ ability . &quot;
&quot; and in order to do this , we need to change the rules of the game . &quot;
we need to change the rules to make this type of behaviour difficult .
&quot; this may sound very melanch@@ oly , as if we could do nothing against it ; as if nothing had changed , as though there will always be the rich and powerful . &quot;
&quot; but as a born optim@@ ist , I see quite well that some have begun to change . &quot;
&quot; in the last few years , we have seen proposals for more transparency regarding the owners of companies . &quot;
the subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G@@ 8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013 .
&quot; since then , the EU has registered in central registers on a national level who is really behind companies in Europe , and who controls it . &quot;
one of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind here .
&quot; representatives of both parties have introduced legislation in both parliamentary chambers , but this does not make progress that we would like to see . &quot;
&quot; we would really like to see how these Panama Dis@@ closure , this huge insight into the world of tax ha@@ v@@ ens , is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally . &quot;
for us at Global Wit@@ ness this is a moment for change .
we need ordinary people who get angry when they see other people hide their true identity behind false labels .
we need leaders in the economy who get up and say : &quot; in@@ transparency is not good for business . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and are committed to ending this kind of in@@ transparency by law . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; together , we can finally stop the in@@ transparency which now allows this kind of tax ev@@ asion , corruption and money la@@ under@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; this is the story , as I was almost kidn@@ apped and landed in the trunk of a red Maz@@ das . &quot;
&quot; one day after I finished my design studies , I made a ticket sale . &quot;
a guy in the red Maz@@ da stopped and looked at my bel@@ ong@@ ings .
he bought one of my works of art .
he was alone in the city and just made a road@@ trip across the country . afterwards he would go to the peace cor@@ ps .
I invited him to a beer . he told me how he wanted to change the world .
it was late . I became tired .
&quot; as we paid the bill , I made the mistake to ask him : &quot; &quot; where do you sleep tonight ? &quot;
&quot; he made the whole thing even worse : &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t know yet . &quot;
&quot; and I thought , &quot; &quot; Oh , man ! &quot;
what do I do now ? &quot;
who doesn &apos;t know the situation ?
do I have to offer a sleeping place now ?
&quot; but I just got to know him ! he says he would go to the cor@@ ps of peace , but I don &apos;t know if he really plans that . I don &apos;t want to land in the trunk of a Maz@@ das ! &quot;
this is a small trunk !
then I heard myself saying : &quot; I have an air mattress . you can sleep in my living room . &quot;
&quot; a voice in my head said , &quot; &quot; Yes , how please ? &quot;
&quot; at night I lay in bed , I star@@ ed at the ceiling and thought , &quot; &quot; Oh man ! what did I get in ? &quot;
a wild stranger sleeps in my living room .
what if he is mad ?
&quot; I got such a fear that I went out of bed , scre@@ aming at the tips of the door , and closing my bedroom door . &quot;
but he was not crazy at all .
we are still in contact .
the work of art he bought from me today hangs in his classroom . he is a teacher now .
this was my first experience as a host . it has completely changed my point of view .
perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who only waited for being discovered ?
&quot; taking people on my air mattress became normal for me . when I moved to San Francisco , I took the air mattress . &quot;
&quot; let &apos;s make a time leap , two years later ... &quot;
&quot; I am unemployed , almost broke , my room@@ mate leaves and the rent is increased . &quot;
I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city . all hotels were fully booked .
&quot; I think creativity can create it , transform fear into fun . &quot;
&quot; I wrote to my best friend and new room@@ mate Brian Ch@@ es@@ ky : &quot; Brian , I thought about how we could earn something about it . our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast . young designers can stay with us , Wi @-@ Fi and a desk included , plus a mattress and each morning breakfast . &quot;
ha ! &quot;
we created a website and founded so &apos; Air mattress and breakfast &apos; &#91; A@@ IR@@ Bed a@@ N@@ d Breakfast = Air@@ b@@ n@@ b &#93; .
three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors .
they found it super and we too .
I &apos;m sure our cheese @-@ ham @-@ om@@ el@@ ets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests .
&quot; when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle , Brian and I star@@ ed . &quot;
had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent ?
things were rolling .
&quot; my former room@@ mate , N@@ ate Ble@@ char@@ czy@@ k , joined us as a developer . &quot;
we wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept .
&quot; we presented to the investors : &quot; we want to create a website where people post publicly pictures of their private rooms , their bedrooms , their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting . &quot;
&quot; over the Internet , they can then invite strangers to stay with them . &quot;
that will be the next big thing ! &quot;
we waited for the mis@@ sile to ign@@ ite .
but they do not .
&quot; nobody , who is still in sol@@ ace , would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people . &quot;
why ?
because we all have learned as children that strangers are dangerous .
&quot; if you have a problem , you can concentrate on things you can do well . we could design . &quot;
at the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience .
&quot; we had learned how to design objects , but now we wanted to create immense confidence by design , between people who had never met before . &quot;
can design afford such a thing ?
is it possible to create trust with design ?
I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we asp@@ ire .
it is a 30 @-@ second experiment . it will force you out of your comfort zone .
thum@@ bs up when you are ready .
take your mobile phone into your hand .
now I want to unlock your mobile phone .
type your un@@ locked cell phone to your left sitting neighbour .
this silent flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time .
the only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home .
&quot; visitors can not only read their SMS , they will see your bedroom , your kitchen , your toilet . &quot;
how does it feel to hold the un@@ locked cell phone of a stranger in your hands ?
most sense the responsibility .
&quot; in this way , most guests feel when they stay somewhere else . &quot;
only for this reason our company can exist .
&quot; just like that , who actually has Al Gor@@ es &apos;s cell phone ? &quot;
could you please tell on Twitter that he is being cann@@ ed for the president &apos;s office ?
you can now return the mobile phones .
you have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build . I want to tell you about some discoveries .
what if we had changed a little detail on this experiment ?
&quot; what if your neighbor had imagined it once with his name ; if he had told , how did he come from , how his dog or his children are called ? &quot;
imagine you would have 150 jud@@ gements that all say : &quot; he can really hold very well sprung cell@@ phones ! &quot;
how would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone ?
a well thought @-@ out feedback system strengthens trust .
&quot; in the beginning , we did some things wrong . &quot;
it was difficult for people to diver@@ t negative jud@@ gements .
&quot; finally , we decided to wait for both hosts and guests to leave their assessments before we put them online . &quot;
last week we discovered something new .
we conducted a study with Stan@@ ford . we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are related to age and residence .
little surprisingly we trust the people most closely related to us .
&quot; the more differences we find , the less we trust . &quot;
this is a natural social bias .
it will be exciting if you add a person &apos;s call -- in our case through assessments .
&quot; if one has less than three convic@@ tions , nothing changes . &quot;
&quot; but if you have more than ten , everything changes . &quot;
a good reputation stems from com@@ mon@@ alities .
the right design can help us overcome some of our deep @-@ rooted preferences .
&quot; in addition , we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself . &quot;
here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest .
&quot; if you tell too little , for example &quot; Hi ! &quot; you don &apos;t get an answer . &quot;
&quot; one tells too much how , for example , &quot; I have problems with my mother &quot; -- -- the request is not accepted . &quot;
&quot; so there is an optimal degree of openness , such as &quot; &quot; Tol@@ le art works in your apartment ! I &apos;m doing vacation with my family . &quot;
how to create it with design to make this degree of openness ?
we use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text . we also give tips on which topics to write something .
our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudi@@ ces against strangers .
what we did not reck@@ on was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudi@@ ces .
here you see how many people use our offer .
you can see three things .
&quot; first , incredibly good luck . &quot;
second : the un@@ ti@@ ring work of our team .
third : a need not previously covered .
&quot; for us , the business is running very well . &quot;
&quot; of course , there are times when not everything goes smoothly . &quot;
there were guests who were not allowed to celebrate parties or have devast@@ ated apartments .
hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain .
at the beginning of the project I worked in customer service . all calls came directly to my mobile phone .
I stood at the front line when confidence broke .
there is nothing worse than these calls . it hur@@ ts when I only think of it .
&quot; the disappointment , which you hear in the voice of the c@@ aller , was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem . &quot;
for people have confidence in each other .
&quot; when trust works , wonderful things can arise . &quot;
one of our guests made holidays in Uruguay . there he suffered a heart attack .
his host drove him to the hospital .
he even donated blood to the necessary operation !
here is his assessment :
perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to se@@ d@@ entary activities .
the area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals .
&quot; J@@ avier and Ale@@ j@@ andra are genuine guar@@ dian angels , who save lives , even though they don &apos;t really know one . &quot;
you drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a b@@ ypass .
&quot; because they don &apos;t want you to feel lonely , they pass books . &quot;
you can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights .
I can only recommend it ! &quot;
&quot; of course , not every stay exp@@ ires . &quot;
but these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy .
&quot; when I stum@@ bled upon this term for the first time , I asked myself : &quot;
how does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions ?
it is an economic trade .
&quot; but now simply call the &quot; &quot; rental industry &quot; , &quot; the thing will not do justice . &quot;
share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships .
&quot; people leave a part of themselves open , and that changes everything . &quot;
&quot; when you travel today , it is possible to compare it with fast food . it is efficient and reliable , but less authentic . &quot;
what if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions ?
&quot; what if in any place you visit , a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a neighbourhood where you have never heard before ; &quot;
or if you could learn cooking from a five @-@ star chef ?
&quot; nowadays , apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy . &quot;
what if we would create apartments from the ground up to one another ?
what would that look like ?
what if cities would accept the idea of shared participation ?
&quot; I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships , instead of lon@@ eliness and isolation . &quot;
&quot; in Seoul &apos;s capital Seoul , this project has already begun . &quot;
were offered to residents now . students looking for a place to stay
&quot; were medi@@ ated to people whose children were moved out . incub@@ ator programmes were started , &quot;
&quot; in order to finance new start @-@ ups in the Share Economy , 7@@ 85@@ ,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or self @-@ host tonight . &quot;
so the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us .
we have not re@@ invented the wheel .
hospitality was already there before .
there were similar websites before us .
so why did our work work ?
&quot; apart from luck and timing , we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust . &quot;
design can help us overcome deep @-@ rooted prejudi@@ ces .
&quot; I find it amazing , &quot;
almost overwhelming .
I have to think every time a red Maz@@ da drives me .
we know of course that design cannot solve every problem .
&quot; but if it could help us , if it had this great influence , I wonder why we can use design soon . &quot;
thank you .
what do you think when you look at me ?
a believer ? an expert ?
maybe even a sister .
&quot; or oppressed , bra@@ in@@ washed , a terrorist ? &quot;
or simply a delay in the security check at the airport .
this is indeed true .
I don &apos;t give you the blame for your negative impressions .
so the media are people that look like me .
a study found that 80 % of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative .
studies show : the Americans think most would not know Muslims .
probably people don &apos;t talk to their U@@ ber drivers .
for all those who have never met a Muslim : it &apos;s great to get to know you .
I tell you who I am .
&quot; I am a mother , a coffee lover -- double es@@ presso , with cream extra . &quot;
&quot; I am intro@@ ver@@ ted , &quot;
&quot; a Mö@@ cht@@ eg@@ ern @-@ Fitness @-@ Fan@@ ati@@ cian , &quot;
&quot; and I am a practicing , spiritual Muslim . &quot;
&quot; but not as Lady G@@ aga sings , because , baby , I wasn &apos;t born that way . &quot;
I made a decision .
when I was 17 years old I decided to ou@@ p myself .
&quot; no , not as a hom@@ osexual person , like some of my friends , but as a Muslim . I decided to wear my hi@@ j@@ ab , my head cover . &quot;
&quot; my feminist friends were horri@@ fied : &quot; &quot; why do you supp@@ ress yourself ? &quot;
&quot; the funny thing was : at that time , it was a feminist Declaration of In@@ dependence which I felt as a 17 @-@ year @-@ old to adapt to a perfect and un@@ at@@ tain@@ able beauty ideal . &quot;
I have not only accepted the faith of my parents .
I have w@@ rest@@ led with the Qur &apos;an .
&quot; I read it , thought , posed , doub@@ ted and ultimately believed . &quot;
my relationship with God was not love at first sight .
it was trust and slow devotion that deep@@ ened with each reading of the Qur &apos;an .
the beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to cry .
I recognize myself in it . I feel God knows me .
&quot; did you ever feel that someone perc@@ ei@@ ves you , fully understands you , and yet somehow loves ? &quot;
this is how it feels .
&quot; later I married and started , like all the good Egyptians , my career as an engineer . &quot;
&quot; later , after my marriage , I had a child , and basically lived the &quot; Egyptian @-@ American Dream . &quot; &quot;
then came that terrible morning in September 2001 .
many of you probably remember exactly where they were there .
&quot; I sat in my kitchen , had breakfast in my kitchen , looked at the screen and saw the word &quot; &quot; Break@@ ing News . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; there was smoke , aircraft flew into buildings , people jumped out of the buildings . &quot;
what was that ?
an accident ?
a technical mal@@ function ?
my shock rapidly turned into indignation .
why should we do something like that ?
&quot; I switched to the TV channel and heard : &quot; ... &quot; Muslim terrorists &quot; ... , &quot; ... &quot; in the name of Islam ... , &quot; ... &quot; Ne@@ ar descent ... , &quot; ... &quot; Ji@@ had ... , &quot; ... &quot; was bom@@ bed Mec@@ ca ! &quot;
&quot; Oh , my God . &quot;
&quot; not only my country has been attacked , but in the N@@ u the deeds of others turned me into a susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , we had to travel through the Mid@@ west of the USA to move to a new city and start studying . &quot;
&quot; I remember how I heard -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat , and I feared for the first time to be recognized as a Muslim . &quot;
&quot; we moved into our apartment this night , in a new city where it felt like a completely different world . &quot;
&quot; and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations , saying , &quot; Be alert , &quot; &quot; Be careful , &quot; &quot; Ke@@ ep in well @-@ lit areas , &quot; &quot; Cl@@ ose not . &quot; &quot;
I stayed inside the whole week .
then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims congreg@@ ate for prayer .
&quot; and again the warnings came : &quot; &quot; don &apos;t go on this first Friday , the mosque could be a goal . &quot;
I saw the extensive reporting .
&quot; the feelings were understand@@ ably un@@ filtered , and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims , pulled into the Free and beating . &quot;
there were really fire attacks on mos@@ ques .
I thought : we should stay at home .
but something did not feel right .
because the people who attacked this country attacked our country .
I got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists .
imagine ! I was angry too .
it is not easy to constantly explain itself .
&quot; I have nothing against questions , I love questions . &quot;
it is the accus@@ ations that are hard .
&quot; today , we can indeed hear people say , &quot; There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims . &quot;
when will we get rid of them ?
some people want to ban@@ ish Muslims and close mos@@ ques .
they speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the USA .
there is only one question : are we malign@@ ant or ben@@ ign ?
they know that a malign@@ ant tumor is removed as a whole and a ben@@ ign tumor is only observed under observation .
the alternatives are point@@ less because the question is wrong .
&quot; Muslims are , like all other Americans , not a tumor in the body of the US , but a vital organ . &quot;
thank you !
&quot; Muslims are invent@@ ors and teachers , first @-@ hand and Olympi@@ ans . &quot;
will the closure of mos@@ ques America make more secure ?
&quot; there may be a few parking places , but do not stop the terror . &quot;
regular visits to a mosque means to consider people more tolerant towards people and to show greater civi@@ c participation .
&quot; and as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area , DC recently told me : people are actually not radic@@ alised in mos@@ ques . &quot;
they are radic@@ alised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer .
&quot; as a first person , the person is cut off from their church , even from their family , so that the extre@@ mi@@ sts believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims , and anyone who ab@@ h@@ or their behavior and ideology is a tra@@ itor or fallen from the faith . &quot;
&quot; if we want to prevent radic@@ alisation , we must stop people to go to the mosque . &quot;
some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion .
&quot; finally , a group like the IS establishes its brut@@ ality with the Koran . &quot;
&quot; as a Muslim , as a mother , I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS . &quot;
but we would add to their imag@@ inations by recognis@@ ing them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers .
thank you !
the IS has so much to do with Islam as the K@@ u @-@ Klu@@ x @-@ Kl@@ an with Christianity .
both groups claim their ideology based on their &quot; holy book . &quot;
&quot; but if you take a look at them , they do not drive what they read in their &quot; Sacred Scripture . &quot; &quot;
it is their brut@@ ality that lets them read these things into the scriptures .
an outstanding ima@@ m recently told me an amazing story :
a girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS .
I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders .
&quot; every spiritual person with whom she spoke brought them to silence , saying that their anger , their sense of injustice in the world , would only bring them into trouble . &quot;
&quot; inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to her anger , she was a major goal for the instrument@@ alisation by extre@@ mi@@ sts , who promised her a solution . &quot;
this Ima@@ m restored the connection to God and their church .
&quot; instead of bl@@ aming them for their anger , he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world . &quot;
&quot; what she learned in the mosque , she kept to join the IS . &quot;
this was an insight into how Islam@@ opho@@ bia affects me and my family .
but how does it affect ordinary Americans ?
how does it affect everyone else ?
how does the 24 @-@ hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought ?
&quot; one study -- actually several neuro@@ scientific studies -- show : when we fear , at least three things happen . &quot;
&quot; we are more accepting an authorit@@ arian government system , conformity and prejudi@@ ce . &quot;
&quot; a study shows that if you submit to test persons messages in which negative about Muslims were reported , they would rather vo@@ ke military attacks on Muslim countries , as well as circumc@@ ision of the rights of American Muslims . &quot;
this is not just an academic problem .
&quot; when you look at when the mood against Muslims was shot upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times , but never in connection with terrorist attacks . &quot;
it happened before the Iraq war and during two election periods .
&quot; so Islam@@ opho@@ bia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror , as I expected . &quot;
&quot; it can actually be a tool to manipul@@ ate the public , in order to under@@ mine the foundation of a free society which has sensible and well informed citizens . &quot;
dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign .
&quot; we may feel it first , but the toxic air of fear har@@ ms us all . &quot;
&quot; with the allocation of collective guilt , it is not only about having to explain themselves . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ah and his wife Y@@ us@@ or were a young , married couple who lived in Chapel Hill , North Carolina , where they both went to school . &quot;
De@@ ah was a sports@@ man .
&quot; he was talented at the Faculty of Dental , talented , promising ... &quot;
&quot; his sister would tell me that he was the sweet@@ est , most generous person she knew . &quot;
she visited him there and he showed her his CV . she was stun@@ ned and said :
&quot; when did such an accomplished young man come from my brother ? &quot;
&quot; only a few weeks after the visit of Su@@ z@@ anne with her brother and wife , her neighbor , Cra@@ ig Stephen Hi@@ cks , murdered her , just as the sister of Y@@ us@@ or , Raz@@ an , who was visiting in the afternoon . &quot;
he shot at De@@ ah eight times .
fan@@ ati@@ cism can not only be im@@ moral but also fatal .
so back to the beginning .
what happened after 9 / 11 ?
did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home ?
&quot; we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision , because it was about what America we want to leave to our children : one that would control us through fear , or one in which we can exercise our religion freely . &quot;
we decided for the mosque .
&quot; with our son in the child &apos;s seat we drove sil@@ ently , with high pressure to the mosque . &quot;
&quot; I took him out , went out of my shoes , went to the house of prayer , and what I saw I stopped . &quot;
the hall was completely filled .
&quot; then the Ima@@ m made an announcement , thank@@ ed and welcomed our guests , as half of the assembled were Christians , Jews , Budd@@ hi@@ sts , a@@ thei@@ sts , believers and non @-@ believers who came not to attack us , but to assist us . &quot;
at this moment I have collap@@ sed .
these people were there because they had pre@@ tended courage and compassion and prejudi@@ ce .
what will you choose ?
what will you choose in the moment of fear and fan@@ ati@@ cism ?
will you be safe on number ?
or will you join those who think : we are better than yours .
thank you .
thank you very much !
Hel@@ en Wal@@ ters : so D@@ alia ; you seem to have hit a nerve .
&quot; but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TE@@ D@@ Talk , a thin@@ ker with drau@@ ght , working in a noble thought factory , so an exception and not the rule . &quot;
what would you say to those people ?
&quot; D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed : I would say , do not dec@@ eive . I am completely normal . &quot;
I am no exception .
my story is not unusual .
I am as usual as it is allowed .
&quot; if you look at Muslims all over the world , and I did that with the largest study on Muslims worldwide , people want normal things . &quot;
&quot; they want prosperity for the family , they want work and they want to live in peace . &quot;
so I &apos;m in no way an exception .
&quot; when people seem like an exception to rule , then often the rule has been broken and they are not the exception to the rule . &quot;
H@@ W : thank you . D@@ alia Mo@@ g@@ ah@@ ed .
what started as a platform for hob@@ by@@ ists is about to become a billi@@ ard business .
&quot; control , environmental monitoring , photography , film and journ@@ alism : these are some of the possible applications for commercial dr@@ ones . this is made possible in research facilities worldwide . &quot;
&quot; before air @-@ parcel delivery in our social consciousness penet@@ rated , an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRA@@ C Centre in France has built a six @-@ meter high tower consisting of 1 500 bricks . some years ago , they began to fly with ropes . &quot;
&quot; by connecting terminals , air units achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space . &quot;
you can also build self @-@ reli@@ eving structures independently .
&quot; they have learned to bear burdens , deal with turbul@@ ence and generally respond to natural laws . &quot;
today we would like to show you some of our new projects .
our goal is to cross the limits of possibilities in the autonomous flight .
&quot; in order for a system to operate autonom@@ ously , it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in the room . &quot;
&quot; in our laboratory at ETH Zurich , we often use external cameras to find objects . this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks . &quot;
&quot; for today &apos;s demos , we use a new loc@@ alization technology from Ver@@ ity Studios , a publisher of our laboratory . &quot;
there are no external cameras .
each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do .
&quot; external commands are available at the highest level , e.g. &quot; &quot; start &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; land &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is a so @-@ called rear starter , &quot;
a flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap .
&quot; like other starter motors , it is efficient in forward flight , much more efficient than helicop@@ ters in all their variations . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to most of the star @-@ gli@@ ders it can float , and has great advantages when starting and landing , and is very versatile . &quot;
&quot; however , there is always a down@@ side . &quot;
a limitation of h@@ edge @-@ star@@ ters is that they react sensi@@ tively to turbul@@ ence like wind bu@@ cks .
we develop new controls and algorithms to improve this .
the idea behind this is that the flight device does not matter in what position the optimum position is reg@@ ained and the performance can be improved by practicing .
okay .
&quot; during our research , we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter . &quot;
&quot; one such question would be , for example : what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights ? &quot;
there are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question .
&quot; helicop@@ ters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts , which assemble to hurt you . &quot;
&quot; decades ago , trained pilots were able to fly remote @-@ controlled flying machines that only had two moving parts : a prop@@ eller and a stern ru@@ dder . &quot;
&quot; recently , we discovered that flying with only one works . &quot;
&quot; this is the Mon@@ osp@@ inner , the mechan@@ ically simple remote @-@ operated flight device . it was invented recently . &quot;
&quot; it has only one moving part , a prop@@ eller , &quot;
&quot; no fl@@ aps , hing@@ es and lateral ru@@ dder , no further actu@@ ators or control surfaces , only one prop@@ eller . &quot;
&quot; although it is mechan@@ ically simple , the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern roller . to bring it to fly , I have to throw it right correctly . &quot;
&quot; the chance to throw it right , if everyone watch me is small , so I &apos;ll show you a video that was filmed last night . &quot;
&quot; if the monster is an exercise in cru@@ el@@ ty , this machine is here , the Omni@@ kop@@ ter with its eight prop@@ ellers , an exercise in abundance . &quot;
what to do with all this abundance ?
they see that it is only symmet@@ rical .
&quot; therefore , it is ambi@@ valent in its orientation . &quot;
&quot; as a result , he receives the au@@ ral skill , &quot;
&quot; moving in the room in all directions , no matter which direction it rot@@ ates or even how it rot@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is complex , mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight prop@@ ellers . &quot;
&quot; a lot is conceivable in models , the rest is learned right when flying . &quot;
let &apos;s take a look at this .
&quot; if flying machines are to be part of our everyday life , they must be extremely secure and reliable . &quot;
this machine consists of two separate two prop@@ eller flying machines .
this rot@@ ates clock@@ wise
and the other anti @-@ clock@@ wise .
&quot; if you build them together , they act like a high @-@ performance quad@@ ro@@ cop@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; if something goes wrong , a motor or prop@@ eller drops off , the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if it is limited . &quot;
we will demonstrate this by making one half in@@ capac@@ itated .
the last demonstration investig@@ ates synthetic chim@@ eras .
&quot; the large number of autonomous , coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression . &quot;
we took standard micro @-@ quad@@ cop@@ ter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with loc@@ alization technology and algorithms .
each unit knows where in space it is and is self @-@ controlled . that is why there is no upper limit .
hopefully you motiv@@ ate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas .
&quot; the particularly safe machine , on the other hand , wants to be a flying lamp@@ shade on Broadway . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology . &quot;
for types like us is the reward in the development and the creative act .
&quot; it serves as a reminder , how wonderful and enchanting our universe is , and that it allows creative , clever creatures to form it in such a spectacular way . &quot;
the fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake .
thank you .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , two black holes cir@@ cl@@ ed each other in a very far distant gal@@ axy , so they converted the mass of three suns to pure energy in a tenth of a second . &quot;
&quot; this short moment , they sh@@ one more brigh@@ tly than all the stars in all gal@@ ax@@ ies of the entire universe known to us . &quot;
it was a very big b@@ ang .
but they did not set up their energy in the form of light --
we finally speak of black holes .
the whole energy was released into space @-@ time @-@ structure itself and the universe explo@@ ded in gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
let us first arrange the events tempor@@ ally .
&quot; 1.3 billion years ago , there was just a multi @-@ cell life on Earth . &quot;
&quot; since then , the Earth has produced a lot : cor@@ als , fish , plants , din@@ osau@@ rs , humans and -- God stands for us -- even the internet . &quot;
&quot; about 25 years ago , a group of particularly courageous -- Ra@@ i Weiss from MIT , Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne and Ron@@ ald Dre@@ ver from the Cal@@ tech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to look for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves , which are caused by col@@ li@@ ding black holes . &quot;
most of them considered them crazy .
but enough people recognized them as crazy geni@@ uses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea .
&quot; after decades of development , design , conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Lig@@ o : the laser interfer@@ ometer gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves observ@@ atory . &quot;
&quot; in the follow @-@ up period , the precision of Lig@@ o was significantly increased , which greatly improved the recognition performance . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is called Advanced Lig@@ o . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of September 2015 , Lig@@ o was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor , persistent problems . &quot;
&quot; on September 14 , 2015 , just a few days after the detector was commissioned , the gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ waves of the two col@@ li@@ ding black holes filled through the earth . &quot;
they went through you and me
and also through the detector .
Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es : only two moments in my life were more emotional than this :
the birth of my daughter
and the farewell from my death @-@ sick father .
basically it was the fruits of my life .
&quot; AA : this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hu@@ gh@@ es , theoretical physi@@ cist at MIT . he has been studying gra@@ vit@@ ational waves from black holes for 23 years and her through observ@@ atories like Lig@@ o measurable signals . but what are gra@@ vit@@ ational waves ? &quot;
a gra@@ vit@@ ational @-@ wave is a c@@ row in the structure of space and time .
&quot; when passing the wave , the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and put into the other . &quot;
teachers in courses of rel@@ ativity theory often lead to a truly brilliant dance .
&quot; stretch and du@@ st@@ ow , stretch and du@@ st@@ ow . &quot;
&quot; the problem is that gra@@ vit@@ ational waves are extremely weak , even ridi@@ culous . &quot;
&quot; on September 14th , for example , each one of us was stretched and polished at the arrival of the waves . the stretching of an average man was 10 high -@@ 21 . &quot;
&quot; that means 20 zer@@ os after the comm@@ a , followed by a 1 . &quot;
&quot; with a five @-@ kilometre laser detector , and that is already absurd , this length would have to be measured in less than a thous@@ and@@ th of the radius of an atomic nucleus . this is gr@@ ot@@ esque . &quot;
at the end of his classical text about gravity
&quot; Ki@@ p Thor@@ ne , a co @-@ founder of Lig@@ os , described the hunt for the waves as follows : &quot; the technical difficulties in building such det@@ ectors are enormous . &quot;
but physi@@ cists are in@@ ventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome . &quot;
&quot; Thor@@ ne published this in 1973 , 42 years before his success . &quot;
back to Lig@@ o . Scott likes to say that Lig@@ o is more an ear than an eye .
I would like to explain what this means .
&quot; visible light has a wavel@@ ength , which is much smaller than the things around us : facial features , the size of your cell . &quot;
&quot; this is quite practical , because you can customize a picture or a map of things by observing the light coming from several points around you . &quot;
with sounds this is different .
audi@@ ble sounds have a wavel@@ ength of up to 15 meters .
&quot; this is why it is very difficult , actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you : &quot;
about your child &apos;s face .
&quot; instead , we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch , rhythm and volume to close the story behind it . &quot;
&quot; now just speaks Alice . &quot;
&quot; and Bob interrup@@ ts her . &quot;
&quot; stupid Bob , too . &quot;
the same goes for gra@@ vit@@ ational waves .
we cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them .
&quot; but by paying attention to changes in ampl@@ itude and frequency of the waves , we can listen to their stories . &quot;
at least for Lig@@ o there are the measured frequencies in the audi@@ ble range .
&quot; so when we convert wave patterns into sound , we can literally hear the universe speak . &quot;
&quot; to listen to the gravity , we can tell us much about the collision of two black holes , which my colleague Scott has already occupied for quite a long time . &quot;
&quot; SH : two black , non @-@ rotating holes , just chir@@ p : w@@ up@@ p ! &quot;
&quot; if the two bodies rotate very quickly , one hears the same chir@@ ping with an additional key change . this sounds like this : W@@ u @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu @-@ wu ! &quot;
&quot; it is a kind of movement vocabulary , marked in the wa@@ ve@@ form . &quot;
&quot; AA : on September 14 , 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Lig@@ o heard the following : &#91; Sur@@ render &apos;s noise &#93; Som@@ ebody , who knows what to hear , acknow@@ le@@ dges this as a sound of -- SH : ... two black holes with 30 @-@ fold solar mass , which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer . &quot;
AA : let &apos;s think about what this means .
&quot; two black holes , the dens@@ est body in space , one with a mass of 29 suns , the other with a mass of 36 suns , revol@@ ve hundred times a second before they col@@ li@@ de . &quot;
imagine these forces .
fantastic .
and we know because we heard it .
therein lies the permanent meaning of Lig@@ o .
Lig@@ o is pav@@ ing the way for the exploration of the universe as it had never been possible before .
on this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible .
&quot; much in space , we can -- practically or basically -- not see . &quot;
&quot; a Super@@ nov@@ a , for example . I would like to know why m@@ asser@@ ei@@ che stars explo@@ de in Super@@ nov@@ ae . &quot;
they are very useful . from them we learned a lot about the universe .
&quot; the exciting physical processes occur at the core , which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron , carbon and silicon . &quot;
we will never go through because these are op@@ aque .
&quot; gra@@ vit@@ ational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass . the Big B@@ ang : I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe , but we will never see them since the Big B@@ ang is obsc@@ ured by its own after@@ glow . &quot;
using gravity waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning .
&quot; and most importantly : I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen , which we will never see and of which we have no idea . things that we only discover by listening . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Lig@@ o found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect . &quot;
&quot; my colleague at MIT , Matt Ev@@ ans , an important member of the Lig@@ o project , says to this topic : me : the kind of stars that produce black holes , as Lig@@ o watches them , are the din@@ osau@@ rs of the universe . &quot;
&quot; the black holes are the su@@ ckers for our archaeological work , so to speak . &quot;
&quot; Lig@@ o gives us a totally different perspective on the happ@@ enings in space , the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos . &quot;
AA : the challenge now consists in being as brave as possible .
&quot; thanks to Lig@@ o , we know how to build great det@@ ectors and listen to the noise and chir@@ ping of the cosmos . &quot;
we need ideas for new observ@@ atories -- a whole new generation of observ@@ atories on earth and in space .
for what could be nic@@ er than listening to the Big B@@ ang ?
now is the time of great dreams .
do you dream with us ?
thank you .
&quot; some time ago , I tried an experiment . &quot;
&quot; for one year I would say &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; , &quot; in front of which I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; no matter if it made me nervous , brought me into unpleasant situations , I forced myself to say &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
did I want to speak to the public ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to be live on TV ?
&quot; no , but yes ! &quot;
did I want to start with the show ?
&quot; no , no , no , yes , yes , yes . &quot;
&quot; and a crazy thing happened : exactly what to do , whereas I was afraid , removed my fear . &quot;
&quot; my fear to keep talking , my social anxiety -- pu@@ ff , away . &quot;
the power of a word is impressive .
&quot; yes &quot; has changed my life .
&quot; yes , &quot; changed me . &quot;
but there was a certain yes that deeply changed my life . it began with a matter of my smallest ones .
&quot; I have three incredible daughters , Har@@ per , Beck@@ ett and Emer@@ son . and Emer@@ son , the smallest , calls all &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; &quot; for in@@ explic@@ able reasons , &quot;
as if she were a wa@@ it@@ ress from the south .
&quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I need milk for my Schn@@ abel@@ t@@ asse . &quot;
&quot; she asked me once , if I could play with her when I was on the go . and I said , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
this yes was the beginning
&quot; from then on , I swear to always play with them once you ask me . no matter what I &apos;m doing , or where I go , I always say Yes -- every single time . &quot;
&quot; almost . I &apos;m not perfect , but I &apos;m very tired . &quot;
&quot; it has a magical effect on me , my children , to our family . &quot;
&quot; but it also has an amazing side effect : only recently I understood fully that the &quot; &quot; yes &quot; &quot; to play with my children saved my career . &quot;
I have a real dream job .
I am the author . I think things are aw@@ aking you to life .
dream job .
no .
I am a Titan .
dream job .
I scre@@ am television . I produce television .
&quot; I make television , in a great style . &quot;
in this TV @-@ season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world .
&quot; four TV programmes , 70 hours of television . three to four shows are simultaneously in production . &quot;
each mission offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before .
the budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars .
let us say five .
&quot; a new episode every nine days once four shows , thus every nine days 20 million dollar television , four TV programs , 70 hours TV , three broad@@ casts that are simultaneously in production four times four , 16 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : sc@@ andal , 15 episodes : the Cat@@ ch , 70 hours television , &quot;
350 million dollars for a season .
in America my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening .
&quot; all over the world , my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers . &quot;
&quot; my brain is global , and 45 of these 70 TV @-@ hours are broad@@ casts that I have created myself and not only produced , so on top of it . I have to find time , really quiet , creative time to gather my fans around the camp@@ fire and to tell my stories . &quot;
&quot; four TV series , 70 hours of television , three , sometimes four , shows at the same time in production , 350 million dollars , camp@@ fires burning around the world . &quot;
do you know who is doing that yet ?
&quot; nobody , therefore , I am a Titan . &quot;
dream job .
I don &apos;t want to impress you with that .
I say it because I know what you think when the word &quot; author &quot; falls .
&quot; I say it to you , that all of you who work as hard as you are now running a company , a country or a classroom , take me seriously if I speak of work , so that you understand that I am not just lying on the computer and f@@ anci@@ ful , and it is true when I say that it does not dream for a dream job . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s all a job , all work , all reality , all blood , all sweat -- no tears . &quot;
&quot; I work a lot , hard and I love it . &quot;
&quot; when I &apos;m immersed in the work , there is no other feeling . &quot;
my work always creates a country out of nothing .
it is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas .
&quot; as a result , one gets a high note , running a marathon . &quot;
you feel like Be@@ y@@ on@@ c@@ é .
and all this at the same time .
I love to work .
&quot; it is creative , mechanical , exhau@@ sting and intoxic@@ ating , funny and disturbing , clin@@ ically and mat@@ ernal , cruel and sensible . &quot;
there is such a change in me when the work goes well .
&quot; a hum@@ ming starts in my head , and it grows and grows , and the hum@@ ming sounds like a busy road , I could go on it forever . &quot;
&quot; many people accept when I declare to them the sums , that I am persu@@ aded that writing gives me joy . &quot;
&quot; don &apos;t get me wrong , you do . &quot;
&quot; but the sums -- when I began working and working with television , when I started working and doing , building , creating and working together , I discovered this thing , this hum@@ ming , this energy . &quot;
the sums are more than writing .
the hum@@ ming is action and activity . the hum@@ ming is a drug .
the sums are music . the hum@@ ming is light and air .
the hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear .
&quot; and if you have such sums , you can &apos;t strive for size differently . &quot;
&quot; the feeling of not being able to look different than to strive for size , no matter what price . &quot;
this is called Sum@@ ma .
or perhaps it means being a work@@ ah@@ olic .
maybe it &apos;s called genius .
perhaps ego is called ego .
perhaps it is fear of failure .
I don &apos;t know .
&quot; I only know that I &apos;m not do@@ omed for failure , and I just know that I love the bu@@ zz . &quot;
&quot; I just want to tell you , I am a Titan , and I know I don &apos;t want to question it . &quot;
&quot; the more successful I become , the more episodes , the more blur@@ red boundaries , the more work there is , the more things I write , the more I write history , the more expectations there is . &quot;
&quot; the more I work to be successful , the more I have to work . &quot;
and what did I say about work ?
&quot; I love work , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming . &quot;
I like this bu@@ zz . I love the bu@@ zz .
I need the sums . I am the bu@@ zz .
am I just this bu@@ zz ?
and then the hum@@ ming stopped .
&quot; over@@ loaded , over@@ loaded , over@@ done , burnt out . &quot;
the sums stopped .
now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mo@@ m is a single working institute .
&quot; Har@@ per tells people : &quot; my m@@ um will not be there , but you can write my N@@ anny . &quot;
&quot; and Emer@@ son says : &quot; &quot; k@@ itt@@ ens , I want to go to Sh@@ on@@ da @-@ Land . &quot;
it is the children of a Tit@@ ans .
they are baby Tit@@ ans .
&quot; they were 12 , 3 and 1 , when the sums were stopped . &quot;
the bu@@ zz of the engine was spe@@ ech@@ less .
I no longer loved my work . the engine was out .
the sums did not come back .
my hum@@ ming was broken .
&quot; I did the same things as always : the same Tit@@ ans work , 15 hours @-@ days , worked weekends , no re@@ mor@@ se , nothing deleg@@ ate , a Titan does not sleep , does not give up , with whole heart , clear eyes , whatever . &quot;
but there was no hum@@ ming .
in me was silence .
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions at the same time , sometimes four . &quot;
&quot; four TV programs , 70 hours , three productions simultaneously ... &quot;
I was the perfect Titan .
&quot; I was a pre @-@ show Titan , &quot;
&quot; everything was grey , I simply had no more fun . &quot;
and that was my life .
everything I did .
I was the bu@@ zz and the bu@@ zz I was .
&quot; so what do you do when what you do , the work you love , suddenly fade away ? &quot;
&quot; I know some may think , &quot; &quot; Today , stupid author Titan . &quot;
&quot; but you know you do it , you do , you are working , you love what you &apos;re doing to be a teacher , a ban@@ ker , a mother , a painter , Bill Gates , you just love another and that gives you the sum if you already knew the sums , who is you then ? &quot;
what are you ?
what am I ?
am I still a Titan ?
&quot; when the song of my heart stops , can I survive in silence ? &quot;
and then my &quot; southern states wa@@ it@@ ress &quot; asks me a question .
&quot; I &apos;m on the way out , late , and she says : &quot; &quot; m@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot;
and I don &apos;t want to say No when I am aware of two things :
&quot; first , I must say yes to everything and secondly , she called me not &quot; &quot; kit@@ ten &quot; . &quot; &quot;
she does not call anyone any longer .
when did that happen ?
&quot; I miss it when I am Titan and mo@@ urn my hum@@ ming , and everything changes in front of my own eyes . &quot;
&quot; and so she says , &quot; &quot; M@@ um , do you like playing ? &quot;
&quot; and I say , &quot; Yes . &quot; &quot;
there is nothing special about it .
&quot; we play and their sisters come across , we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book &quot; Every@@ body Po@@ ops . &quot; &quot;
nothing extraordinary .
&quot; but it is outstanding because my pain and panic , in lon@@ eliness and absence of money , I can &apos;t do anything except watch out . &quot;
I am focused .
I am quiet .
&quot; the country I created , the marathon , which I run , the army , the screen , the high tone - they no longer exist . &quot;
&quot; everything that exists is sti@@ cky fingers and moist kis@@ ses , delicate voices , wax cra@@ y@@ ons and the song in which it &apos;s about letting go , or whatever the girl in &quot; &quot; The Ice Queen &quot; . &quot; &quot;
everywhere is peace and simplicity .
the air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe .
I can hardly believe that I breathe .
playing is the opposite of works .
and I am happy .
something inside me dis@@ sol@@ ves .
a mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in .
&quot; and that not right away , but it happens , it happens . &quot;
I feel it .
the hum@@ ming is slowly coming back .
&quot; no full volume , hardly there , it &apos;s quiet , barely audi@@ ble , but it &apos;s there . &quot;
&quot; not the sums , but a sum . &quot;
and now I feel like I know a magic secret .
but let &apos;s stay with the matter .
it is love . that &apos;s all .
no magic . no secret . only love .
it is something we have forgotten .
&quot; the sums , the sums of work , the titanium sum , that is just the replacement . &quot;
&quot; if I ask you who you are , if I tell you who I am , when I describe myself with the help of broad@@ casts and television hours and how working my brain is , then I forgot what the real sums are . &quot;
the sums are not strength and it is not labour @-@ specific .
it depends on the joy .
the real sum is dependent on love .
the sum is the current that comes from the lust of life .
the real sums are self @-@ confidence and peace .
&quot; the real sum ignor@@ es the pressure of history , the tasks to be done , the expectation and the pressure . &quot;
the real sum is simple and original .
&quot; true hum@@ ming is God &apos;s voice in my ear , but perhaps God whis@@ pered to me the wrong words , for which God said to me that I am a Titan ? &quot;
it is just love .
&quot; we all need a bit more love , much more love . &quot;
&quot; as soon as my child wants to play with me , I will say yes . &quot;
&quot; I do this as a rule , so that I can free myself as a work@@ ah@@ olic of any guilt . &quot;
&quot; it is law , I have no choice . I have no choice if I want to hear the hum@@ ming again . &quot;
&quot; I wish it would be so simple . I &apos;m not good in playing , I don &apos;t like it . &quot;
playing is not enough for me as to how to work .
&quot; the truth hur@@ ts , &quot;
but I don &apos;t like to play it .
I always work because I love it .
I prefer working at the workplace than at home .
&quot; this admission is painful , because what a person prefers to work rather than being home ? &quot;
&quot; well yes , I . &quot;
&quot; honestly , I call myself &quot; Titan . &quot; &quot;
I have to have problems .
that I am too relaxed is none of them .
&quot; we rush around in the garden , before and back , back and forth . &quot;
&quot; we make small dance parties , &quot;
we sing and play ball .
we crum@@ ble soap bubbles .
&quot; I feel mostly stiff , absent and confused . &quot;
I always take my phone .
but it is ok .
&quot; my children show me how to live , and the hum@@ ming of the universe ful@@ fills me . &quot;
I play and play until I ask myself : why have we ever stopped playing ?
you can also say it ! always say yes if your child wants to play with you .
perhaps you keep me nai@@ ve for a day@@ dream .
&quot; you are right , but you can do it too ! &quot;
you have time !
and do you know why ? they &apos;re not R@@ ih@@ anna or a Mu@@ pp@@ et Show character .
your child will find you less interesting than you think .
it is only 15 minutes .
&quot; my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes , until they think they want to do something else . &quot;
&quot; it is wonderful 15 minutes , but just 15 minutes . &quot;
after 15 minutes a lad@@ y@@ bug or bis@@ cuit is replaced .
&quot; and talking my teen @-@ daughter for 15 minutes with me , I am the mother of the year . &quot;
&quot; there are only 15 minutes , more is not needed . &quot;
&quot; each one can take 15 minutes on the piece , even on a bad mood @-@ day ! &quot;
15 minutes in the play !
&quot; no mobile phone , no laundry , no distra@@ ction . &quot;
&quot; the day is short : dinner , the children are ready to pray . &quot;
but 15 minutes are in it !
&quot; my children are my well @-@ being , my world . they don &apos;t have to be the children . it &apos;s important to feel the hum@@ ming , having a place for peace of mind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not about playing with your own children . it &apos;s about joy , &quot;
&quot; in order to &quot; &quot; play &quot; &quot; in general . &quot;
treat yourself to the 15 minutes !
find out what you do well .
find out and maintain it .
&quot; I &apos;m not perfect in it . I &apos;ll fail and I &apos;ll win . friends meet , read books , enjoy the day -- &quot;
&quot; do you want to play ? &quot; &quot; stands briefly for everything I &apos;ve given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training , when I wanted to sur@@ pass myself more and more . &quot;
15 minutes in the play why not treat yourself to 15 minutes ?
what can be wrong with it ? nothing !
the sums came back in my spare time . the sums seem to return when I don &apos;t work .
working does not work without playing .
&quot; it takes time , but after a few months a door opens , the energy flows in and I find myself again in my office . I hear an unknown melody , it fills me and my soul . &quot;
&quot; I like the bu@@ zz , but I don &apos;t love it . &quot;
I don &apos;t need it .
&quot; I &apos;m not the bu@@ zz , the bu@@ zz is not me ... no more . &quot;
&quot; soap bubbles and sti@@ cky fingers , dinner with friends . &quot;
this is my hum@@ ming now .
the hum@@ ming of life .
the Sum@@ ma of Love .
&quot; the sum of the work is part of me , but just one part . and I am so thank@@ ful for that . &quot;
it &apos;s sn@@ apped to me that I am a Titan . I have never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem .
I said yes to less work and more games .
and yet I have everything under control . my brain is still functioning . my camp@@ fire is still burning .
&quot; the more I play , the happ@@ ier I and my children . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I feel as a good mother . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more clear my head is . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the better I work . &quot;
&quot; the more I play , the more I hear the hum@@ ming . the land I created , the marathon , which I run , the troops , the can@@ v@@ ases , the high tone , the hum@@ ming , the hum@@ ming , the other , the right sum : the hum@@ ming of life . &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this bu@@ zz , the more this unusual , dying , naked and new feeling of life in me is wide . less Titan -- more I ! &quot;
&quot; the more I feel this h@@ um , the more I know who I am . &quot;
&quot; I am the author . I think things out , I wake you up to life . &quot;
&quot; this is part of the job , which means living his dream . &quot;
&quot; this is the dream of this job , &quot;
because a dream job should be a little dre@@ amy .
&quot; I said &quot; &quot; Yes &quot; &quot; to less work and more games . &quot;
Tit@@ ans have no chance here .
&quot; want to play ? &quot;
thank you very much .
I am a neuro@@ surgeon .
&quot; like most of my colleagues , I have to do with human trage@@ dies every day . &quot;
&quot; I know how your life can change from one second to another , after a heavy stroke or after a car accident . &quot;
&quot; for us neuro@@ sur@@ geons it is very frustr@@ ating that the brain , unlike other body organs , has a very low ability to self @-@ healing . &quot;
&quot; after a serious injury to the central nervous system , patients often have a permanent , severe disability . &quot;
this is probably the reason why I became a neuro@@ surgeon .
what is a functional neuro@@ surgeon ?
a doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures .
&quot; they certainly have heard of one of the best known , the &quot; deep @-@ brain stimulation . &quot; in doing so , one im@@ pl@@ anti@@ ates an electrode deep in the brain to influence the neur@@ on circuits in such a way that the neuro@@ logical function improves . &quot;
it really is an amazing technology . it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson &apos;s disease who suffered from severe trem@@ ors and severe pain .
neuro@@ mod@@ ulation does not mean ne@@ uro @-@ healing .
the dream of functional neuro@@ surgeon is the restoration of the brain .
&quot; in my opinion , we approach this dream . &quot;
I would like to show you that we are very close to you .
&quot; with some help , the brain can help itself . &quot;
the story began 15 years ago .
&quot; at that time I was a senior physician , working day and night in the emergency room . &quot;
often I supplied patients with skull @-@ brain trauma .
&quot; you must imagine that in skull @-@ brain trau@@ mas , the brain becomes un@@ willing and the cran@@ ial pressure increases . &quot;
&quot; in order to save life , you have to l@@ essen the pressure of the skull . &quot;
sometimes you have to remove a part of s@@ wollen brain mass .
&quot; instead of throwing away the s@@ wollen brain mass , we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean @-@ François Brun@@ et , one of my colleagues . &quot;
what do I mean by that ?
we wanted to make cells grow from this tissue .
this is not an easy task .
&quot; to make cells grow from a tissue piece , is comparable to all small children who are taken out of your families . &quot;
&quot; you have to find the right diet , temperature , humidity , and environments to thri@@ ve them . &quot;
that is exactly what we had to do with these cells .
&quot; after many attempts , Jean @-@ François was eliminated . &quot;
he saw that under his microscope .
that was a big surprise for us .
why ?
&quot; it looked exactly like a stem cell culture . with large green cells surrounded by small , un@@ ripe cells . &quot;
&quot; perhaps you still know from the biology class that stem cells are un@@ ripe cells , which can transform into any cell type of the organism . &quot;
&quot; the adult brain has stem cells , but very few . they are hidden in deep , small ni@@ ches of the brain . &quot;
it is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery .
we made another fascinating observation : normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly .
they never die ; they are immort@@ al .
but these cells beha@@ ved differently .
they split slowly and after a few weeks they even died .
&quot; so we saw a new strange cell population , which looked like stem cells , but beha@@ ved differently . &quot;
we needed long to understand where they came from .
they originate from these cells .
these blue and red cells are called Dou@@ ble@@ cor@@ tin @-@ positive cells .
we all have them in our brain .
they make up 4 % of our cereb@@ ral cor@@ tex cells .
they play a very important role in our development .
in the fet@@ us stage they care for the folding of the brain .
but why do they stay with us ?
we don &apos;t know that .
&quot; we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain , as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries . &quot;
but this is not so sure .
but one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells .
we stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing .
we had to prove this .
so we decided to develop an experiment .
we wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non @-@ linguistic area and then cultivate the cells just as it did Jean @-@ François .
and then they mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain .
&quot; in the last step , we re @-@ engineered it at the origin of the same individual . &quot;
we call the aut@@ olog@@ ous transplan@@ tation -- auto@@ graf@@ ting .
one of our first questions was : what happens when we re @-@ establish these cells in normal brain tissue ? and what will happen when we re @-@ establish the same cells in damaged brain tissue ?
&quot; thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rou@@ il@@ ler , we were able to work with apes . &quot;
&quot; in the first scenario we put the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared altogether as if they were taken back , they go back home . the space is already occupied , they are not needed there , so they disappear . &quot;
&quot; in the second scenario , we inserted an injury and re @-@ engineered precisely the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neur@@ ons . &quot;
here you see what we could observe under the microscope .
these are the cells that have been re @-@ imported .
&quot; the evidence they show are these little points . these are the cells , which we stained in vitro , in culture . &quot;
&quot; of course , we could not stop here . &quot;
do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury ?
so we trained apes with a manual dex@@ ter@@ ity task .
they had to take food pellets out of one tray .
they made it very good .
&quot; when they reached a stable level of skill , we passed the motor skills range in the motor cor@@ tex . &quot;
&quot; then the monkeys were paraly@@ zed , they could no longer move their hand . &quot;
&quot; just as it would happen in humans , they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree , just like after a stroke . &quot;
&quot; the patients are paraly@@ zed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms . they recover to a certain degree , just as with apes . &quot;
&quot; when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery , we im@@ planted his own cells . &quot;
on the left you can see the monkey that recovered spontaneously .
it can provide about 40 % to 50 % of its original performance from injury .
it is not so precise and not so fast .
&quot; see now , when we re @-@ planted the cells : the same monkey , two months after the expl@@ ant@@ ation . &quot;
I can tell you that they were also very exciting results for us .
since then we have found a lot more about these cells .
we can freeze them and use them later .
&quot; we can use them in other neu@@ rop@@ ath@@ ological models , for example in Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
but our dream is still to im@@ planted them in humans .
I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself .
thank you .
&quot; Bruno Giussani : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , that &apos;s wonderful , I &apos;m sure that just now , several dozen people in the audience , maybe even the majority , think : &quot; I know someone who can take it . &quot;
I definitely .
&quot; of course , the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans . &quot;
&quot; Jo@@ cel@@ yne Blo@@ ch : the biggest obstacles are the authorities . starting from these great results , you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is understandable , the brain is very delicate , etc . &quot;
&quot; J@@ B : yes , but it takes a long time , a lot of patience and an almost professional team . &quot;
&quot; BG : look into the future -- you completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials . if you continue to look into the future , how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital , and this therapy will be available . &quot;
J@@ B : it &apos;s hard to say .
&quot; first , it depends on the approval of the clinical trial . &quot;
will it allow us the authority to launch it soon ?
then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients .
it takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this type of treatment .
&quot; after that , you have to apply it to a multi @-@ centric study . &quot;
first you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone .
&quot; BG : and that it is safe , of course . J@@ B : of course . &quot;
&quot; BG : Jo@@ cel@@ yne , thank you for visiting TED and that you have told us about it . &quot;
BG : thank you very much .
democracy .
we in the West make a big mistake to consider them self @-@ evident .
&quot; we see democracy not as the fragile plant it is in reality , but as an inventory of our society . &quot;
we tend to consider them as imm@@ utable inde@@ b@@ ness .
we believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy .
this is not true .
&quot; Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flour@@ ishing capitalism and impressive growth , while politics remains completely un@@ democratic . &quot;
&quot; in fact , democracy is d@@ wind@@ ling with us , in Europe . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as the finance minister in the Euro@@ group , that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece . &quot;
&quot; at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew or the Communist Party of China , or some of my friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abol@@ ished if it would change anything . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I would like to present you an economic model for true democracy . &quot;
&quot; I ask you , together with me , to believe that Lee Ku@@ an Y@@ ew , the Communist Party of China and even the Euro@@ group succ@@ um@@ bed to wrong belief , we could save democracy , but that we need a genuine and defensive democracy . &quot;
&quot; without democracy , our societies are bri@@ ghter , our future is ble@@ ating and our great new technologies are wasted . &quot;
&quot; on the subject of waste , I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies . &quot;
&quot; I call it the &quot; &quot; twin summit parad@@ ox &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a top is known to you . you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt , which casts his long shadow over the US , Europe and the whole world . &quot;
&quot; we all recognize the mountain of debt , &quot;
but few recognize his twin brother .
&quot; a mountain of unused cash , which belongs to the wealthy econom@@ ists and corporations , who are too timi@@ d to invest there where it would be productive and income , with which one could pay the debt mountain and also produce all those things that humanity urgently needs , for example &quot; green &quot; energy . &quot;
I call them two numbers .
&quot; over the past 3 months , 3,@@ 4 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars were invested in the United States , England and the euro area , in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants , machinery , office buildings , schools , roads , tracks , equipment and so on and so forth . &quot;
&quot; $ 3.4 tri@@ l@@ lion will sound after a lot of money until it compar@@ es with the $ 5.1 tri@@ l@@ lion US dollars , which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions , and did absolutely nothing to infl@@ ate the stock market prices . &quot;
&quot; thus , debt and un@@ productive capital form the twin summ@@ its , which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms . &quot;
&quot; the result is stagn@@ ant wages , more than a quarter of the 25 @-@ 54 @-@ year @-@ old unemployed in the US , Japan and Europe , and consequently a low macro@@ economic demand , which , as in an endless loop , advoc@@ ates the p@@ essi@@ mis@@ m of investors , which , as in an endless loop , could be true that his son would kill him if he grows &quot;
un@@ intentionally bring about the circumstances that cause O@@ edi@@ pus to kill him .
this is my stri@@ fe with capitalism --
&quot; his extremely lav@@ ish art . all un@@ productive capital should be used to improve our lives , develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies , &quot; green &quot; technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth . &quot;
is democracy the solution ?
&quot; but before we proceed , what do we mean by democracy ? &quot;
Arist@@ ot@@ le defined democracy as the form of society where the free and the poor control the government as a majority .
&quot; of course , the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy ended too many . &quot;
&quot; women , foreigners , and of course slaves . &quot;
but it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy due to these exclu@@ sions .
&quot; the decisive thing in the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy was and is that it applied the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression , but more important and decisive , which gave them the right to political co @-@ determination with the same mood of mood in questions of public prosec@@ utor . &quot;
the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy did not last long --
&quot; like a candle that g@@ lows very brigh@@ tly , it is also quickly burned out . &quot;
&quot; however , our current liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies do not have their roots in ancient Athens , &quot;
&quot; but in Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , in the glorious revolution of 16@@ 88 , even in the American constitution . &quot;
&quot; while the Ath@@ en@@ ian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthening the working poor , our liberal democracy is based on the values of Mag@@ na Cart@@ a , which ultimately was a statute for rulers . &quot;
&quot; the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics , while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- has become a democracy @-@ free zone . &quot;
&quot; in today &apos;s demo@@ cra@@ cies , there has been a rel@@ ent@@ less struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy began , by gradually under@@ mining politics and escap@@ ing them . &quot;
do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be ?
it is not a degeneration of their DNA .
&quot; it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power , because the power has mig@@ rated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated . &quot;
I mentioned my dis@@ cord with capitalism .
&quot; if you think about it , it is about like a herd of predat@@ ors who so sustain@@ ably dec@@ im@@ ated the animals from which they fed , dec@@ im@@ ated that at the end they star@@ ved . &quot;
&quot; similarly , it is with the economy that has so far can@@ ni@@ bal@@ ised politics that it hur@@ ts itself through the self @-@ created economic crisis itself . the power of the corporations is growing , political goods are inv@@ ali@@ dated , the inequality arises , the macro@@ economic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too sc@@ ared to invest in the cash of their companies . &quot;
&quot; the more successful capitalism drives the &quot; demo@@ crats &quot; out of democracy , the higher the twin summ@@ its , and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind . &quot;
&quot; if this is true , it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy , and it would be better if the &quot; demos &quot; control the control , as in ancient Athens , apart from the exclusion of slaves , women and foreigners . &quot;
&quot; by the way , this is not a new idea . &quot;
the Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well .
the lesson from the de@@ bac@@ le of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brut@@ ality and extravag@@ ance .
but there is a solution : abol@@ ish the working poor !
capitalism does it by replacing low @-@ wage workers with automation and robots .
&quot; the problem is , as long as economy and politics are separate areas , automation makes the twin summit higher , the waste hab@@ itable , and the social conflicts lower , as it is already very soon , as I believe -- in countries like China . &quot;
&quot; so we must re@@ unite the economy and re@@ unite the areas of economy and politics , and ensure that we are democr@@ ati@@ zing the re @-@ unified area , otherwise we end up in an ill surveillance hyper@@ auto@@ cracy , which makes the film &quot; Matrix &quot; like a documentary . &quot;
&quot; the question is , therefore , not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced -- &quot;
&quot; the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a d@@ yst@@ op@@ ie , similar to the &quot; matrix , &quot; or something similar to society in &quot; Star Tre@@ k , &quot; in which machines are serving people and people indulge their energy into resear@@ ching the universe , or to indulge in a high @-@ tech version of the ancient Ath@@ eni@@ ans &quot; A@@ gor@@ a . &quot; &quot;
I think we can be optimistic .
so what would it be like to have this &quot; Star Tre@@ k &quot; -@@ like utop@@ ia instead of the &quot; matrix &quot; like D@@ yst@@ op@@ ie ?
&quot; in practical implementation , I would like to give you some examples in brief . &quot;
&quot; in the area of companies , please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital is followed by a job to the next , from a company to the next , and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company . &quot;
then all income comes from capital and revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely over@@ taken .
&quot; no distinction between those who belong to the company , but they do not work in it , and employees working there that the company does not belong to . no exchange of exchange between capital and labour , no big gaps between investment and savings , and ultimately no up@@ lifting twin @-@ tops . &quot;
&quot; in the field of global political economy : please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctu@@ ating exchange rate , in a universal , global , digital currency issued by the IMF &#91; International Monetary Fund &#93; , and the G @-@ 20 &#91; Group of the 20 largest emerging countries &#93; , in the interest of all humanity . &quot;
&quot; imagine that the whole world trade is tra@@ ded in this currency -- we call it &quot; the Cos@@ mos , &quot; in units of &quot; Cos@@ mos &quot; -- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country into a common fund . &quot;
&quot; imagine that this fund is investing in &quot; green &quot; technologies , especially in parts of the world where investment funds are ra@@ r . &quot;
this is not a new idea .
it is basically what John May@@ n@@ ard Key@@ nes proposed in the Bret@@ ton W@@ oods Conference from 1944 .
the problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it .
&quot; today we have them , especially against the background of a re@@ unified politics and economy . &quot;
&quot; the world I describe to you is also liber@@ ally , in which it fav@@ ours privileged people , and Mar@@ xi@@ an because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage dump of history , and Key@@ nes@@ ian , global Key@@ nes@@ ian . &quot;
but above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a true democracy .
will we wake up in such a world
or will we sink into a &quot; matrix &quot; - similar d@@ yst@@ op@@ ia ?
the answer depends on how we decide together politically .
&quot; it is in our hands , and we do it better democr@@ atically . &quot;
thank you .
Bruno Giussani : Yan@@ is ...
you describe yourself as liber@@ t@@ arian Marx@@ ists in your biography .
how relevant is Marx &apos;s analysis today ?
&quot; Yan@@ is Var@@ ou@@ fak@@ is : if anything of what I have just said is relevant , then Marx is relevant . &quot;
&quot; the reason for the re@@ unification of politics and economy is ... Do we not do this , technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand , which Lar@@ ry Sum@@ mers call &quot; long @-@ term stagn@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; by transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next , as we are currently experiencing , it will not only dest@@ abili@@ ze our demo@@ cra@@ cies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low . &quot;
&quot; if this analysis is correct , then Marx is quite relevant , &quot;
&quot; like Ha@@ ye@@ k , that is why I am a liberal Marxist , and as Key@@ nes , and therefore I am totally confused . &quot;
&quot; BG : in fact , and now we are well . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ V : if you don &apos;t work , you don &apos;t think enough . &quot;
&quot; BG : this is a very Greek , a kind of philosophical explanation -- Y@@ V : actually it was Einstein who said this . BG : in your lecture , you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West &apos;s view of China . &quot;
would you like to repeat it here ?
Y@@ V : there is a great deal of hypo@@ cris@@ y .
in our liberal demo@@ cra@@ cies we have the appearance of democracy .
&quot; as I said in my lecture , we have limited democracy to politics , while the area where most of it plays , the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone . &quot;
&quot; in a sense , if I dare to say so pro@@ voc@@ atively , China is similar to the England of the 19th century . &quot;
&quot; for -- remember -- we tend to combine liber@@ alism with democracy -- that is a mistake , historically considered . &quot;
&quot; liber@@ alism , liber@@ als , like John Stu@@ art Mill -- &quot;
he was particularly scep@@ tical about the democratic development .
&quot; what one can observe in China now resembles very much the development we had in England during the industrial revolution , particularly the transition from the first to the second . &quot;
&quot; to submit to China now to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself , smells tremend@@ ously to hypo@@ cris@@ y . &quot;
BG : I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greece &apos;s finance ministers at the beginning of the year .
Y@@ V : I suspected this was coming .
BG : yes ...
how do you look back six months later to the first half of the year ?
&quot; Y@@ V : very exciting , from a personal point of view , and very dis@@ ap@@ pointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; not only Greece , but the euro@@ zone , &quot;
&quot; to say goodbye to compl@@ ac@@ ency , and the constant denial that a massive dump@@ ing line went through the euro@@ zone and continues , which massi@@ vely threat@@ ens the development of the whole European Union . &quot;
&quot; we had the opportunity , based on the Greek proposal -- by the way , the first proposal that revealed this denial -- &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , the powers within the euro@@ zone , within the European group , still chose the denial . &quot;
but you know what is coming .
this is the experience from the Soviet Union --
&quot; if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable , through political will and authorit@@ ari@@ anism , you might be able to delay it for a while , but when the changes occur , it happens ab@@ rup@@ tly and destructive . &quot;
BG : what changes do you fores@@ ee ?
&quot; Y@@ V : there is no doubt that the euro@@ zone has no future , if we do not change its structure . &quot;
BG : did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance ?
Y@@ V : every day .
BG : for example ? Y@@ V : everyone who looks back -- Seri@@ ously ...
&quot; if there is a finance minister or any minister who after 6 months in office , especially in such a ten@@ se situation , claims he has made no mistake , then it is a dangerous person . &quot;
of course I made mistakes .
the biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February .
I believed that there was an honest interest in the len@@ ders of the len@@ ders to find a common solution .
but there was no such thing .
&quot; they merely wanted to bring our government down , just because they did not want to deal with the distor@@ tions passed through the euro@@ zone . &quot;
they did not want to admit that they have been a cat@@ astrop@@ hic program in Greece for 5 years .
we lost one third of our nominal GDP .
there is worse than during the &quot; Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; none of the tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika &apos;s tro@@ ika , who imposed this policy on us , conf@@ essed : &quot; this was a col@@ os@@ sal mistake . &quot;
&quot; BG : despite all this , and despite the aggressive actions of the talks , you seem to be quite pro @-@ European . &quot;
Y@@ V : absolutely .
&quot; &quot; &quot; my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone has come from someone who lives and loves Europe . &quot;
my greatest fear is that the euro zone will not survive .
&quot; for if they do not survive , the released centri@@ fu@@ gal forces will be demon@@ ic and destroy the European Union . &quot;
&quot; this will not have cat@@ astrop@@ hic consequences for Europe alone , but for the entire world economy . &quot;
we are probably the strongest economy in the world .
&quot; if we allow ourselves to take the path of a post @-@ modern 1930s , after which it appears to me , it will also be detri@@ mental to the future of Europeans and non @-@ Europeans . &quot;
BG : we hope that you are wrong at this point .
&quot; Yan@@ is , thank you for having stayed with TED . &quot;
Y@@ V : thank you .
&quot; most of them have never heard of Roy Price , although he is probably responsible for twenty @-@ eight minutes of your life on 19th April 2013 . &quot;
probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you .
this goes back to the decision that Roy had met three years ago .
Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios .
the TV production company from Amazon .
&quot; he is 47 years old , slim , has an icon and describes herself on Twitter as &quot; Mo@@ vies , TV , Techni@@ que , Tac@@ os . &quot; &quot;
Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for looking out the shows and the content that Amazon will produce .
&quot; of course , this is a very hard @-@ fought industry . &quot;
there are so many TV shows that Roy can not choose any .
&quot; he has to find shows that are very , very good . &quot;
&quot; in other words , he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve . &quot;
this curve is the review distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IM@@ DB website . the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows this review will receive .
&quot; if your show is rated with nine and higher , this is a winner . &quot;
then you have a successful show .
&quot; these are shows like &quot; Break@@ ing Bad , &quot; &quot; Game of Thr@@ ones , &quot; &quot; The Wire &quot; -- all the shows that are addic@@ ting where , after looking at a season , your brain asks : &quot; where are there more of these episodes ? &quot;
this kind of show .
&quot; on the left , here at this end , shows like &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; -- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve . &quot;
&quot; Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve , because I think one needs special intelligence to offer &quot; &quot; To@@ dd@@ lers and Ti@@ ar@@ as &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he gets more thoughts about the medium output , the average television -- shows that are neither good nor bad , they simply don &apos;t exc@@ ite . &quot;
so he must make sure that he is really on the right side .
&quot; the pressure is present , and of course it is the first time Amazon makes something like that , so Roy Price doesn &apos;t want to risk anything . &quot;
he wants to create success .
&quot; he needs guaranteed success , so he stops a competition . &quot;
&quot; he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses by an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows , then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online , where they can watch for free . &quot;
&quot; and when Amazon comes out for nothing , is it going to attack , right ? &quot;
millions of spectators watch these episodes .
&quot; however , they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows . &quot;
they are watched by Roy and his team who record everything .
&quot; you capture when you start the show , when you pause , which parts you jump over or look again . &quot;
you collect millions of data to decide which show you should produce .
&quot; in fact , they collect the data , process them and this results in the answer , and this is : &quot; Amazon should make a sit@@ com over four republi@@ can US sen@@ ators . &quot;
they made this show .
does anybody know the name of this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; Alpha House , &quot; but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn &apos;t that good . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just an average show -- in the tru@@ est sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.@@ 4 and Alpha House lands around 7.5 -- meaning something above average , but not exactly what Roy and his team worked . &quot;
&quot; about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis . his name is T@@ ed , T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os , the manager for programming of Net@@ fli@@ x . just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it , but he makes it a bit different . &quot;
&quot; instead of hosting a contest , he and his team looked at the available data on the Net@@ fli@@ x viewer , so the reviews they give the shows their course , what shows they like , etc . &quot;
&quot; then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience : what shows they like , which producers , which actors . &quot;
&quot; when they had all the parts together , they took a venture and decided not to make a sit@@ com over four Sen@@ ators , but a drama series about a Senator . &quot;
do you know this show ?
&quot; yes , &quot; House of Cards . &quot; Net@@ fli@@ x has landed a hit , at least for the first two seasons . &quot;
house of Cards &quot; gets a 9.@@ 1 rating on this curve . so exactly where they wanted to go .
&quot; of course , the question is : what has happened here ? &quot;
&quot; one has two very competitive , data sealed companies . &quot;
&quot; they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them , but not for the other company . &quot;
what is that ?
because logic says somehow that it should work with everything .
&quot; if you collect millions of data , for a decision you make , you should make a good decision . &quot;
you have 200 years of statistics as a back @-@ up .
it is optimized by very powerful computers .
&quot; the least thing you can expect is good TV , isn &apos;t it ? &quot;
&quot; if data analysis does not work this way , then this is a bit frigh@@ tening , because we live in a time in which we have more and more statistics to make serious decisions , far beyond television . &quot;
does anyone know the Multi @-@ Health System here ?
&quot; nobody . OK , that &apos;s even good . &quot;
&quot; multi @-@ Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software . if you come into contact , you are in prison . &quot;
&quot; if someone is in jail here in the US and ask for discharge , it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not . &quot;
&quot; just like Amazon and Net@@ fli@@ x . but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad , it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad . &quot;
&quot; moderate television , 22 minutes , this can be really bad , but even more years in prison are worse . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , there is evidence that this data analysis , despite the many data , &quot;
not always produce the best results . this is not because a company like Multi @-@ Health Systems does not know how to use data .
the data of experienced companies are also wrong .
&quot; yes , even Google sometimes makes mistakes . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 , Google announced that they can predict out@@ breaks of flu , the worst kind , by data analysis of Google searches . &quot;
it worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation . success culmin@@ ated in a publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot;
&quot; it worked perfectly , year by year , until it suddenly stopped working , &quot;
and no one could say why .
&quot; it simply did not work , this was once again a sensation , including the re@@ vocation of publication in the magazine &quot; Nature . &quot; &quot;
even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes mis@@ understand something .
&quot; despite all these mistakes , data flow increasingly into decisions of life -- at the workplace , in the enforcement of law , in medicine . &quot;
so we should make sure that data is helpful .
&quot; I also know many difficulties with data . I work in computer @-@ aided genetics , an area where some very wise people use vast amounts of data to make serious decisions , such as deciding on a cancer therapy . &quot;
or the development of a medication . over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions . this pattern should be spread .
&quot; you need to solve a complex problem , mainly two things : &quot;
&quot; first , dis@@ assemble this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyse individual parts ; as a second you put the individual parts together in order to make a decision . &quot;
&quot; sometimes you have to do this several times , but there are always two things : take apart and put together again . &quot;
and now the most important thing : data and data analysis are just good for the first part .
&quot; data and data analysis , no matter how powerful , can only help to dis@@ assemble a problem and understand its parts . &quot;
they are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a conclusion .
there is another tool for this and we all own it : our brain .
&quot; if there is something in which the brain is good , it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again , even if the information is incomplete , in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert . &quot;
&quot; that &apos;s why I think Net@@ fli@@ x was so successful because they used data and minds , where they also belong in the process . &quot;
&quot; they use data to better understand their audience , which they would otherwise have not been able to do . but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like &quot; House of Cards , &quot; was not in the data . &quot;
T@@ ed Sar@@ and@@ os and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with that decision .
Amazon however did this in the wrong way .
&quot; they used data to control all their decisions first when they were competing for TV ideas , then selecting &quot; Alpha House &quot; as a show . &quot;
it was a safe decision because they were always able to say : &quot; they tell us the data . &quot;
it did not lead to the desired result .
&quot; data is helpful for better decisions , but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions . &quot;
&quot; no matter how powerful they are , data are just one tool , and to not forget that , this device is quite useful . &quot;
many of you will ...
&quot; before there was data , this was the device for decisions . &quot;
many know it .
&quot; it &apos;s also called &quot; &quot; Magic 8 Ball &quot; . &quot; it &apos;s amazing . for decisions using a yes or no question , you just need to shake the ball to get an answer . &quot; highly prob@@ able &quot; -- exactly here at this moment . &quot;
I will fight it out later with a technique demo .
&quot; I have made some decisions in my life so far , and I should have listened to the ball in hind@@ sight . &quot;
&quot; but , as you of course know , if you have the data available , you would like to replace it by something much more sophisticated , such as data analysis to make better decisions . &quot;
but this does not change the basic structure .
&quot; in the end , it &apos;s up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner . &quot;
&quot; and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it is still paying off to make decisions , to be an expert in what you do , and take risks . &quot;
&quot; at the end , it is not the data , but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve . &quot;
thank you very much .
