<seg id="1">That is James Risen.</seg>
<seg id="2">You may know him because he won the Pulitzer Prize as a New York Times reporter.</seg>
<seg id="3">"long before anyone heard of Edward Snowden, Risen wrote a book in which he published spectacularly that the NSA has illegally listened to phones of Americans."</seg>
<seg id="4">But it is another chapter which should leave a lasting impression.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in this he describes a catastrophic US intelligence operation, in which the CIA delivered literally drafts for an atomic bomb."</seg>
<seg id="6">"if that sounds crazy, read it."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is an incredible story.</seg>
<seg id="8">But do you know who did not like the chapter?</seg>
<seg id="9">The U.S. government.</seg>
<seg id="10">"for almost 10 years, the government has determined against Risen and called upon him to call his alleged sources."</seg>
<seg id="11">"in this train, he became a symbol of the government's pattern of condemning whistleblower and spy on journalists."</seg>
<seg id="12">"according to the First Trial Chamber, the media have the right to publish confidential information."</seg>
<seg id="13">But it is impossible to apply this right when media do not get this information and if they cannot protect the identity of the brave they are revealing.</seg>
<seg id="14">"so when the government knocked at Risen, he did something that many courageous reporters were doing before him: he refused and said he would rather go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="15">"from 2007 to 2015, Risen therefore lived with the risk to go to prison."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but then, just days before the trial, something extraordinary happened."</seg>
<seg id="17">"suddenly, even though they claim for years that it was essential for their case, the demands of the government were dropped to Risen."</seg>
<seg id="18">The reason: in the time of electronic surveillance the reporters and sources can hide themselves less and less.</seg>
<seg id="19">"instead of separators and Risen to make statements, they could also do his digital footprints for him."</seg>
<seg id="20">"and so the investigators, without his consent, secretly apprehend his telephone numbers,"</seg>
<seg id="21">"just like his email data, financial and banking information, his credit, and even travel tips with the list of his flights."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the midst of this information, they found evidence they used to condemn Jeffrey Sterling, a CIA Whistleblower and Risens supposed source."</seg>
<seg id="23">"unfortunately, this is only one of many cases."</seg>
<seg id="24">"President Obama promised to protect whistleblower, but instead the judiciary has condemned more than all U.S. governments before him."</seg>
<seg id="25">"now you can imagine how this can be a problem, especially because the government classifies too much of its work as a secret."</seg>
<seg id="26">"since September 11, almost every article on national security was the result of a whistleblower went to a journalist."</seg>
<seg id="27">"so we put the press work on the game, which is to be protected by the first constitution, because the government has more and more possibilities to spy on all."</seg>
<seg id="28">"but just as the government's technology allows to circumvent the rights of reporters, the press can also use technologies to better protect its sources."</seg>
<seg id="29">"they can do it from the moment they contact, rather than in hindsight, in the witness stand."</seg>
<seg id="30">"today there are communication software, which has not yet been published when Risen had written his book, and it is much safer than normal emails or phone calls."</seg>
<seg id="31">"such technology is SecureDrop, an open source transmission system for whistleblowers, which was originally developed by the Internet-famous Aaron Swartz, and is today developed by the Freedom of the Press Foundation, at which I am working."</seg>
<seg id="32">"instead of sending an email, go to a news website, just like the Washington Post."</seg>
<seg id="33">"there you can upload or send documents, just as with any common contact form."</seg>
<seg id="34">"these are then encrypted and stored on a server, to which only the respective news agency has access."</seg>
<seg id="35">"so the government can no longer collect information secretly, and many of the information that it would request would not be available from the outset."</seg>
<seg id="36">But SecureDrop is only a small part of the whole to protect press freedom in the 21st century.</seg>
<seg id="37">"unfortunately, governments around the world are developing new spy technologies that endanger us all."</seg>
<seg id="38">"it is important to us to ensure that not only technologists such as Edward Snowden have a possibility to reveal their misdeeds. it is just as important that we protect the next whistle-blowers,"</seg>
<seg id="39">Or the nearest environment workers who alarm the contaminated water of Flint. or a Wallstreet-Insider that warns us of the next financial crisis.</seg>
<seg id="40">"after all, these technologies were not only made for those who want to expose crimes, but to protect our all constitutional rights."</seg>
<seg id="41">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="42">[what does this mean?] [we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we asked Robert Palmer of Global Witness for an explanation.] This week we were sent from news about a leak of 11 million documents of the Panama-based law firm Mosaken Fonseca.</seg>
<seg id="43">The publication of these documents gives a small insight into the secret world of tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="44">"we get an impression of how customers, banks and lawyers go to companies like Mosbag Fonseca and say:" okay, we need an anonymous company. can you set up that? "</seg>
<seg id="45">"we actually see the e-mails, the exchange of messages, how the whole system works as it works."</seg>
<seg id="46">This has led to very direct consequences.</seg>
<seg id="47">The Prime Minister of Iceland has resigned.</seg>
<seg id="48">There are also reports that an ally of the brutal Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad has in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="49">"it is said that a track of 2 billion US dollars is leading to Russian President Vladimir Putin, about a close friend of children's days, a famous cellists."</seg>
<seg id="50">"now there will be a lot of rich people out there and others who wait nervously for the next release, and on the next revealed documents."</seg>
<seg id="51">Now it sounds like the plot of an agent or a John-Grisham-novel.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it seems crying away from you, me, ordinary people."</seg>
<seg id="53">Why should this happen to us?</seg>
<seg id="54">"but the truth is: if the rich and powerful are able to hide their wealth in tax havens and not all pay their taxes, this means less money for important public services such as health care, education, roads."</seg>
<seg id="55">And that concerns us all.</seg>
<seg id="56">"for my organization, Global Witness, these revelations are phenomenal."</seg>
<seg id="57">"all over the world, media and leaders discuss how secret tax havens are used by some few to hide and disguise their wealth -- something that we have been discussing and exposing for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="58">"I think many people seem to be very confusing this whole world, and it is hard to understand how these tax havens work."</seg>
<seg id="59">I always imagine it like a Matryjoschkapuppe.</seg>
<seg id="60">"so you have a company in another company, in another company, which makes it almost impossible to really understand who is behind those buildings."</seg>
<seg id="61">"it can be very difficult for law enforcement and tax authorities, as well as for journalists or civil society to really understand what it is."</seg>
<seg id="62">I find it also interesting that there are less reports on this matter in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="63">"probably because there were so far no prominent Americans who were in such revelations, this scandal."</seg>
<seg id="64">Now it is not that there are no rich Americans hiding their wealth in tax havens.</seg>
<seg id="65">"but by the principle that these tax havens work, Mosaken Fonseca has less American customers."</seg>
<seg id="66">"if we had a data leck from the Cayman Islands or even from Delaware, Wyoming or Nevada, we would see a lot more cases and examples that have links to the USA."</seg>
<seg id="67">"in fact, in some US states, less information needs to be provided to form a company than to obtain a library card."</seg>
<seg id="68">This type of intransparency in the USA allowed employees of school districts to rip school children.</seg>
<seg id="69">Scammers are allowed to rip off especially vulnerable investors.</seg>
<seg id="70">It is this kind of behavior that affects all of us.</seg>
<seg id="71">Here at Global Witness we wanted to find out how all this looks in practice.</seg>
<seg id="72">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="73">So we sent a hidden investigator into the offices of 13 lawyers in Manhattan.</seg>
<seg id="74">"our investigator gave himself up as an African minister who wanted to bring suspicious money to the USA to buy a house, a yacht, a private jet."</seg>
<seg id="75">We really shocked the fact that everyone up to a lawyer made suggestions on how to transfer his money.</seg>
<seg id="76">"none of these lawyers took us as clients, and of course nobody was given money to anybody. however, it shows the problem with this system."</seg>
<seg id="77">It is also important not to consider this as an individual case.</seg>
<seg id="78">It is not a single lawyer who has submitted proposals to our secret investigator.</seg>
<seg id="79">It's not about a single leading politician involved in scandal.</seg>
<seg id="80">"it is about how the system works, through corruption, tax evasion, poverty and instability."</seg>
<seg id="81">"and in order to do this, we need to change the rules of the game."</seg>
<seg id="82">We need to change the rules to make this type of behaviour difficult.</seg>
<seg id="83">"this may sound very melancholy, as if we could do nothing against it; as if nothing had changed, as though there will always be the rich and powerful."</seg>
<seg id="84">"but as a born optimist, I see quite well that some have begun to change."</seg>
<seg id="85">"in the last few years, we have seen proposals for more transparency regarding the owners of companies."</seg>
<seg id="86">The subject took political attention by British Prime Minister David Cameron on the G8 summit in Northern Ireland in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="87">"since then, the EU has registered in central registers on a national level who is really behind companies in Europe, and who controls it."</seg>
<seg id="88">One of the unpleasant facts is that the US is behind here.</seg>
<seg id="89">"representatives of both parties have introduced legislation in both parliamentary chambers, but this does not make progress that we would like to see."</seg>
<seg id="90">"we would really like to see how these Panama Disclosure, this huge insight into the world of tax havens, is used as a means to ensure greater transparency in the US and globally."</seg>
<seg id="91">For us at Global Witness this is a moment for change.</seg>
<seg id="92">We need ordinary people who get angry when they see other people hide their true identity behind false labels.</seg>
<seg id="93">We need leaders in the economy who get up and say: "intransparency is not good for business."</seg>
<seg id="94">"" "we need leading politicians who recognise the problem and are committed to ending this kind of intransparency by law."</seg>
<seg id="95">"" "together, we can finally stop the intransparency which now allows this kind of tax evasion, corruption and money laundering."</seg>
<seg id="96">"this is the story, as I was almost kidnapped and landed in the trunk of a red Mazdas."</seg>
<seg id="97">"one day after I finished my design studies, I made a ticket sale."</seg>
<seg id="98">A guy in the red Mazda stopped and looked at my belongings.</seg>
<seg id="99">He bought one of my works of art.</seg>
<seg id="100">He was alone in the city and just made a roadtrip across the country. afterwards he would go to the peace corps.</seg>
<seg id="101">I invited him to a beer. he told me how he wanted to change the world.</seg>
<seg id="102">It was late. I became tired.</seg>
<seg id="103">"as we paid the bill, I made the mistake to ask him:" "where do you sleep tonight?"</seg>
<seg id="104">"he made the whole thing even worse:" "I don't know yet."</seg>
<seg id="105">"and I thought," "Oh, man!"</seg>
<seg id="106">What do I do now? "</seg>
<seg id="107">Who doesn't know the situation?</seg>
<seg id="108">Do I have to offer a sleeping place now?</seg>
<seg id="109">"but I just got to know him! he says he would go to the corps of peace, but I don't know if he really plans that. I don't want to land in the trunk of a Mazdas!"</seg>
<seg id="110">This is a small trunk!</seg>
<seg id="111">Then I heard myself saying: "I have an air mattress. you can sleep in my living room."</seg>
<seg id="112">"a voice in my head said," "Yes, how please?"</seg>
<seg id="113">"at night I lay in bed, I stared at the ceiling and thought," "Oh man! what did I get in?"</seg>
<seg id="114">A wild stranger sleeps in my living room.</seg>
<seg id="115">What if he is mad?</seg>
<seg id="116">"I got such a fear that I went out of bed, screaming at the tips of the door, and closing my bedroom door."</seg>
<seg id="117">But he was not crazy at all.</seg>
<seg id="118">We are still in contact.</seg>
<seg id="119">The work of art he bought from me today hangs in his classroom. he is a teacher now.</seg>
<seg id="120">This was my first experience as a host. it has completely changed my point of view.</seg>
<seg id="121">Perhaps the people who were sold to me as strangers in childhood were actually friends who only waited for being discovered?</seg>
<seg id="122">"taking people on my air mattress became normal for me. when I moved to San Francisco, I took the air mattress."</seg>
<seg id="123">"let's make a time leap, two years later..."</seg>
<seg id="124">"I am unemployed, almost broke, my roommate leaves and the rent is increased."</seg>
<seg id="125">I learned that at that time there was a design conference in the city. all hotels were fully booked.</seg>
<seg id="126">"I think creativity can create it, transform fear into fun."</seg>
<seg id="127">"I wrote to my best friend and new roommate Brian Chesky:" Brian, I thought about how we could earn something about it. our apartment becomes a designer bed and breakfast. young designers can stay with us, Wi-Fi and a desk included, plus a mattress and each morning breakfast. "</seg>
<seg id="128">Ha! "</seg>
<seg id="129">We created a website and founded so 'Air mattress and breakfast' [AIRBed aNd Breakfast = Airbnb].</seg>
<seg id="130">Three lucky guests were allowed to sleep for 20 dollars on the air mattress on wooden floors.</seg>
<seg id="131">They found it super and we too.</seg>
<seg id="132">I'm sure our cheese-ham-omelets tasted completely different because we made them for our guests.</seg>
<seg id="133">"when we passed our last guest and the door fell into the castle, Brian and I stared."</seg>
<seg id="134">Had we just discovered that we were able to find new friends at the same time and pay our rent?</seg>
<seg id="135">Things were rolling.</seg>
<seg id="136">"my former roommate, Nate Blecharczyk, joined us as a developer."</seg>
<seg id="137">We wanted to find out if we could make it a business concept.</seg>
<seg id="138">"we presented to the investors:" we want to create a website where people post publicly pictures of their private rooms, their bedrooms, their bathrooms -- the type of room whose doors are closed when visiting. "</seg>
<seg id="139">"over the Internet, they can then invite strangers to stay with them."</seg>
<seg id="140">That will be the next big thing! "</seg>
<seg id="141">We waited for the missile to ignite.</seg>
<seg id="142">But they do not.</seg>
<seg id="143">"nobody, who is still in solace, would invest in a business that allows foreigners to sleep in apartments of other people."</seg>
<seg id="144">Why?</seg>
<seg id="145">Because we all have learned as children that strangers are dangerous.</seg>
<seg id="146">"if you have a problem, you can concentrate on things you can do well. we could design."</seg>
<seg id="147">At the Academy of Fine Arts we learned that design is much more than just look and feel -- it is the overall experience.</seg>
<seg id="148">"we had learned how to design objects, but now we wanted to create immense confidence by design, between people who had never met before."</seg>
<seg id="149">Can design afford such a thing?</seg>
<seg id="150">Is it possible to create trust with design?</seg>
<seg id="151">I would like to give you a sample of which degree of trust we aspire.</seg>
<seg id="152">It is a 30-second experiment. it will force you out of your comfort zone.</seg>
<seg id="153">Thumbs up when you are ready.</seg>
<seg id="154">Take your mobile phone into your hand.</seg>
<seg id="155">Now I want to unlock your mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="156">Type your unlocked cell phone to your left sitting neighbour.</seg>
<seg id="157">This silent flight of panic you feel now -- -- is exactly what hosts feel when they open the door for the first time.</seg>
<seg id="158">The only thing that is more personal than your mobile phone is your home.</seg>
<seg id="159">"visitors can not only read their SMS, they will see your bedroom, your kitchen, your toilet."</seg>
<seg id="160">How does it feel to hold the unlocked cell phone of a stranger in your hands?</seg>
<seg id="161">Most sense the responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="162">"in this way, most guests feel when they stay somewhere else."</seg>
<seg id="163">Only for this reason our company can exist.</seg>
<seg id="164">"just like that, who actually has Al Gores's cell phone?"</seg>
<seg id="165">Could you please tell on Twitter that he is being canned for the president's office?</seg>
<seg id="166">You can now return the mobile phones.</seg>
<seg id="167">You have now experienced what kind of trust we want to build. I want to tell you about some discoveries.</seg>
<seg id="168">What if we had changed a little detail on this experiment?</seg>
<seg id="169">"what if your neighbor had imagined it once with his name; if he had told, how did he come from, how his dog or his children are called?"</seg>
<seg id="170">Imagine you would have 150 judgements that all say: "he can really hold very well sprung cellphones!"</seg>
<seg id="171">How would you feel if you had to leave your mobile phone?</seg>
<seg id="172">A well thought-out feedback system strengthens trust.</seg>
<seg id="173">"in the beginning, we did some things wrong."</seg>
<seg id="174">It was difficult for people to divert negative judgements.</seg>
<seg id="175">"finally, we decided to wait for both hosts and guests to leave their assessments before we put them online."</seg>
<seg id="176">Last week we discovered something new.</seg>
<seg id="177">We conducted a study with Stanford. we examined how likely it is that people trust each other depending on how much they are related to age and residence.</seg>
<seg id="178">Little surprisingly we trust the people most closely related to us.</seg>
<seg id="179">"the more differences we find, the less we trust."</seg>
<seg id="180">This is a natural social bias.</seg>
<seg id="181">It will be exciting if you add a person's call -- in our case through assessments.</seg>
<seg id="182">"if one has less than three convictions, nothing changes."</seg>
<seg id="183">"but if you have more than ten, everything changes."</seg>
<seg id="184">A good reputation stems from commonalities.</seg>
<seg id="185">The right design can help us overcome some of our deep-rooted preferences.</seg>
<seg id="186">"in addition, we learned that trust is dependent on how much you get from yourself."</seg>
<seg id="187">Here you can see the reactions to the first message of a guest.</seg>
<seg id="188">"if you tell too little, for example" Hi! "you don't get an answer."</seg>
<seg id="189">"one tells too much how, for example," I have problems with my mother "-- -- the request is not accepted."</seg>
<seg id="190">"so there is an optimal degree of openness, such as" "Tolle art works in your apartment! I'm doing vacation with my family."</seg>
<seg id="191">How to create it with design to make this degree of openness?</seg>
<seg id="192">We use the size of the text field to recommend the correct amount of text. we also give tips on which topics to write something.</seg>
<seg id="193">Our whole company builds on the hope that the right design can help to overcome our prejudices against strangers.</seg>
<seg id="194">What we did not reckon was the great amount of people who were more than willing to lay down these prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="195">Here you see how many people use our offer.</seg>
<seg id="196">You can see three things.</seg>
<seg id="197">"first, incredibly good luck."</seg>
<seg id="198">Second: the untiring work of our team.</seg>
<seg id="199">Third: a need not previously covered.</seg>
<seg id="200">"for us, the business is running very well."</seg>
<seg id="201">"of course, there are times when not everything goes smoothly."</seg>
<seg id="202">There were guests who were not allowed to celebrate parties or have devastated apartments.</seg>
<seg id="203">Hosts have allowed guests to stand in the rain.</seg>
<seg id="204">At the beginning of the project I worked in customer service. all calls came directly to my mobile phone.</seg>
<seg id="205">I stood at the front line when confidence broke.</seg>
<seg id="206">There is nothing worse than these calls. it hurts when I only think of it.</seg>
<seg id="207">"the disappointment, which you hear in the voice of the caller, was and will always be our greatest motivation to further improve."</seg>
<seg id="208">"fortunately, only a fraction of the 123 million overnight stays had a problem."</seg>
<seg id="209">For people have confidence in each other.</seg>
<seg id="210">"when trust works, wonderful things can arise."</seg>
<seg id="211">One of our guests made holidays in Uruguay. there he suffered a heart attack.</seg>
<seg id="212">His host drove him to the hospital.</seg>
<seg id="213">He even donated blood to the necessary operation!</seg>
<seg id="214">Here is his assessment:</seg>
<seg id="215">Perfect house for travelers who are prone to heart attacks due to sedentary activities.</seg>
<seg id="216">The area is beautiful and equipped with sufficient hospitals.</seg>
<seg id="217">"Javier and Alejandra are genuine guardian angels, who save lives, even though they don't really know one."</seg>
<seg id="218">You drive one in your own car to the hospital when you die and wait while you get a bypass.</seg>
<seg id="219">"because they don't want you to feel lonely, they pass books."</seg>
<seg id="220">You can even stay longer without calculating the extra nights.</seg>
<seg id="221">I can only recommend it! "</seg>
<seg id="222">"of course, not every stay expires."</seg>
<seg id="223">But these relations behind the pure money transaction are exactly what you want to achieve with the Share Economy.</seg>
<seg id="224">"when I stumbled upon this term for the first time, I asked myself:"</seg>
<seg id="225">How does the idea of sharing work together with money transactions?</seg>
<seg id="226">It is an economic trade.</seg>
<seg id="227">"but now simply call the" "rental industry", "the thing will not do justice."</seg>
<seg id="228">Share Economy describes a trade that promises human relationships.</seg>
<seg id="229">"people leave a part of themselves open, and that changes everything."</seg>
<seg id="230">"when you travel today, it is possible to compare it with fast food. it is efficient and reliable, but less authentic."</seg>
<seg id="231">What if travelling would be a rich buffet of local impressions?</seg>
<seg id="232">"what if in any place you visit, a group of residents would wait to fill a thoroughly and show a neighbourhood where you have never heard before;"</seg>
<seg id="233">Or if you could learn cooking from a five-star chef?</seg>
<seg id="234">"nowadays, apartments are designed according to the principle of privacy."</seg>
<seg id="235">What if we would create apartments from the ground up to one another?</seg>
<seg id="236">What would that look like?</seg>
<seg id="237">What if cities would accept the idea of shared participation?</seg>
<seg id="238">"I imagine cities that allow us society and relationships, instead of loneliness and isolation."</seg>
<seg id="239">"in Seoul's capital Seoul, this project has already begun."</seg>
<seg id="240">Were offered to residents now. students looking for a place to stay</seg>
<seg id="241">"were mediated to people whose children were moved out. incubator programmes were started,"</seg>
<seg id="242">"in order to finance new start-ups in the Share Economy, 785,000 people in 191 countries will be hosted by a stranger or self-host tonight."</seg>
<seg id="243">So the idea does not seem to be as crazy as it was taught to us.</seg>
<seg id="244">We have not reinvented the wheel.</seg>
<seg id="245">Hospitality was already there before.</seg>
<seg id="246">There were similar websites before us.</seg>
<seg id="247">So why did our work work?</seg>
<seg id="248">"apart from luck and timing, we realized that you can find the right design with the components of trust."</seg>
<seg id="249">Design can help us overcome deep-rooted prejudices.</seg>
<seg id="250">"I find it amazing,"</seg>
<seg id="251">Almost overwhelming.</seg>
<seg id="252">I have to think every time a red Mazda drives me.</seg>
<seg id="253">We know of course that design cannot solve every problem.</seg>
<seg id="254">"but if it could help us, if it had this great influence, I wonder why we can use design soon."</seg>
<seg id="255">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="256">What do you think when you look at me?</seg>
<seg id="257">A believer? an expert?</seg>
<seg id="258">Maybe even a sister.</seg>
<seg id="259">"or oppressed, brainwashed, a terrorist?"</seg>
<seg id="260">Or simply a delay in the security check at the airport.</seg>
<seg id="261">This is indeed true.</seg>
<seg id="262">I don't give you the blame for your negative impressions.</seg>
<seg id="263">So the media are people that look like me.</seg>
<seg id="264">A study found that 80% of reporting about Islam and Muslims is negative.</seg>
<seg id="265">Studies show: the Americans think most would not know Muslims.</seg>
<seg id="266">Probably people don't talk to their Uber drivers.</seg>
<seg id="267">For all those who have never met a Muslim: it's great to get to know you.</seg>
<seg id="268">I tell you who I am.</seg>
<seg id="269">"I am a mother, a coffee lover -- double espresso, with cream extra."</seg>
<seg id="270">"I am introverted,"</seg>
<seg id="271">"a Möchtegern-Fitness-Fanatician,"</seg>
<seg id="272">"and I am a practicing, spiritual Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="273">"but not as Lady Gaga sings, because, baby, I wasn't born that way."</seg>
<seg id="274">I made a decision.</seg>
<seg id="275">When I was 17 years old I decided to oup myself.</seg>
<seg id="276">"no, not as a homosexual person, like some of my friends, but as a Muslim. I decided to wear my hijab, my head cover."</seg>
<seg id="277">"my feminist friends were horrified:" "why do you suppress yourself?"</seg>
<seg id="278">"the funny thing was: at that time, it was a feminist Declaration of Independence which I felt as a 17-year-old to adapt to a perfect and unattainable beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="279">I have not only accepted the faith of my parents.</seg>
<seg id="280">I have wrestled with the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="281">"I read it, thought, posed, doubted and ultimately believed."</seg>
<seg id="282">My relationship with God was not love at first sight.</seg>
<seg id="283">It was trust and slow devotion that deepened with each reading of the Qur'an.</seg>
<seg id="284">The beauty of rhythm sometimes brings me to cry.</seg>
<seg id="285">I recognize myself in it. I feel God knows me.</seg>
<seg id="286">"did you ever feel that someone perceives you, fully understands you, and yet somehow loves?"</seg>
<seg id="287">This is how it feels.</seg>
<seg id="288">"later I married and started, like all the good Egyptians, my career as an engineer."</seg>
<seg id="289">"later, after my marriage, I had a child, and basically lived the" Egyptian-American Dream. ""</seg>
<seg id="290">Then came that terrible morning in September 2001.</seg>
<seg id="291">Many of you probably remember exactly where they were there.</seg>
<seg id="292">"I sat in my kitchen, had breakfast in my kitchen, looked at the screen and saw the word" "Breaking News." ""</seg>
<seg id="293">"there was smoke, aircraft flew into buildings, people jumped out of the buildings."</seg>
<seg id="294">What was that?</seg>
<seg id="295">An accident?</seg>
<seg id="296">A technical malfunction?</seg>
<seg id="297">My shock rapidly turned into indignation.</seg>
<seg id="298">Why should we do something like that?</seg>
<seg id="299">"I switched to the TV channel and heard:"... "Muslim terrorists"..., "..." in the name of Islam..., "..." Near descent..., "..." Jihad..., "..." was bombed Mecca! "</seg>
<seg id="300">"Oh, my God."</seg>
<seg id="301">"not only my country has been attacked, but in the Nu the deeds of others turned me into a suspects."</seg>
<seg id="302">"on the same day, we had to travel through the Midwest of the USA to move to a new city and start studying."</seg>
<seg id="303">"I remember how I heard -- when we were silent -- so deep it went into my seat, and I feared for the first time to be recognized as a Muslim."</seg>
<seg id="304">"we moved into our apartment this night, in a new city where it felt like a completely different world."</seg>
<seg id="305">"and then I heard and read the warnings of the national Islamic organisations, saying," Be alert, "" Be careful, "" Keep in well-lit areas, "" Close not. ""</seg>
<seg id="306">I stayed inside the whole week.</seg>
<seg id="307">Then it was Friday that week -- the day Muslims congregate for prayer.</seg>
<seg id="308">"and again the warnings came:" "don't go on this first Friday, the mosque could be a goal."</seg>
<seg id="309">I saw the extensive reporting.</seg>
<seg id="310">"the feelings were understandably unfiltered, and I also heard of attacks on Muslims or by people who were held for Muslims, pulled into the Free and beating."</seg>
<seg id="311">There were really fire attacks on mosques.</seg>
<seg id="312">I thought: we should stay at home.</seg>
<seg id="313">But something did not feel right.</seg>
<seg id="314">Because the people who attacked this country attacked our country.</seg>
<seg id="315">I got rid of the anger of the people on the terrorists.</seg>
<seg id="316">Imagine! I was angry too.</seg>
<seg id="317">It is not easy to constantly explain itself.</seg>
<seg id="318">"I have nothing against questions, I love questions."</seg>
<seg id="319">It is the accusations that are hard.</seg>
<seg id="320">"today, we can indeed hear people say," There is a problem in this country -- it is called Muslims. "</seg>
<seg id="321">When will we get rid of them?</seg>
<seg id="322">Some people want to banish Muslims and close mosques.</seg>
<seg id="323">They speak of my church as from a tumor in the body of the USA.</seg>
<seg id="324">There is only one question: are we malignant or benign?</seg>
<seg id="325">They know that a malignant tumor is removed as a whole and a benign tumor is only observed under observation.</seg>
<seg id="326">The alternatives are pointless because the question is wrong.</seg>
<seg id="327">"Muslims are, like all other Americans, not a tumor in the body of the US, but a vital organ."</seg>
<seg id="328">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="329">"Muslims are inventors and teachers, first-hand and Olympians."</seg>
<seg id="330">Will the closure of mosques America make more secure?</seg>
<seg id="331">"there may be a few parking places, but do not stop the terror."</seg>
<seg id="332">Regular visits to a mosque means to consider people more tolerant towards people and to show greater civic participation.</seg>
<seg id="333">"and as a leader of the police in the Washington DC area, DC recently told me: people are actually not radicalised in mosques."</seg>
<seg id="334">They are radicalised in their basement or in bed in front of a computer.</seg>
<seg id="335">"as a first person, the person is cut off from their church, even from their family, so that the extremists believe that the terrorists are the true Muslims, and anyone who abhor their behavior and ideology is a traitor or fallen from the faith."</seg>
<seg id="336">"if we want to prevent radicalisation, we must stop people to go to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="337">Some will still claim that Islam is a violent religion.</seg>
<seg id="338">"finally, a group like the IS establishes its brutality with the Koran."</seg>
<seg id="339">"as a Muslim, as a mother, I think we must do everything to stop a group like the IS."</seg>
<seg id="340">But we would add to their imaginations by recognising them as representatives of 1.6 billion believers.</seg>
<seg id="341">Thank you!</seg>
<seg id="342">The IS has so much to do with Islam as the Ku-Klux-Klan with Christianity.</seg>
<seg id="343">Both groups claim their ideology based on their "holy book."</seg>
<seg id="344">"but if you take a look at them, they do not drive what they read in their" Sacred Scripture. ""</seg>
<seg id="345">It is their brutality that lets them read these things into the scriptures.</seg>
<seg id="346">An outstanding imam recently told me an amazing story:</seg>
<seg id="347">A girl came to him because she wanted to join the IS.</seg>
<seg id="348">I was really surprised and asked him if she had been in contact with radical religious leaders.</seg>
<seg id="349">"every spiritual person with whom she spoke brought them to silence, saying that their anger, their sense of injustice in the world, would only bring them into trouble."</seg>
<seg id="350">"inspired by nothing and something that would have made sense to her anger, she was a major goal for the instrumentalisation by extremists, who promised her a solution."</seg>
<seg id="351">This Imam restored the connection to God and their church.</seg>
<seg id="352">"instead of blaming them for their anger, he showed their constructive ways for a real change in the world."</seg>
<seg id="353">"what she learned in the mosque, she kept to join the IS."</seg>
<seg id="354">This was an insight into how Islamophobia affects me and my family.</seg>
<seg id="355">But how does it affect ordinary Americans?</seg>
<seg id="356">How does it affect everyone else?</seg>
<seg id="357">How does the 24-hour consumption of fear affect our democracy every day on our freedom of thought?</seg>
<seg id="358">"one study -- actually several neuroscientific studies -- show: when we fear, at least three things happen."</seg>
<seg id="359">"we are more accepting an authoritarian government system, conformity and prejudice."</seg>
<seg id="360">"a study shows that if you submit to test persons messages in which negative about Muslims were reported, they would rather voke military attacks on Muslim countries, as well as circumcision of the rights of American Muslims."</seg>
<seg id="361">This is not just an academic problem.</seg>
<seg id="362">"when you look at when the mood against Muslims was shot upward -- between 2001 and 2013 -- then this happened three times, but never in connection with terrorist attacks."</seg>
<seg id="363">It happened before the Iraq war and during two election periods.</seg>
<seg id="364">"so Islamophobia is not simply the natural response to Muslim terror, as I expected."</seg>
<seg id="365">"it can actually be a tool to manipulate the public, in order to undermine the foundation of a free society which has sensible and well informed citizens."</seg>
<seg id="366">Dealing with Muslims is an early warning sign.</seg>
<seg id="367">"we may feel it first, but the toxic air of fear harms us all."</seg>
<seg id="368">"with the allocation of collective guilt, it is not only about having to explain themselves."</seg>
<seg id="369">"Deah and his wife Yusor were a young, married couple who lived in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where they both went to school."</seg>
<seg id="370">Deah was a sportsman.</seg>
<seg id="371">"he was talented at the Faculty of Dental, talented, promising..."</seg>
<seg id="372">"his sister would tell me that he was the sweetest, most generous person she knew."</seg>
<seg id="373">She visited him there and he showed her his CV. she was stunned and said:</seg>
<seg id="374">"when did such an accomplished young man come from my brother?"</seg>
<seg id="375">"only a few weeks after the visit of Suzanne with her brother and wife, her neighbor, Craig Stephen Hicks, murdered her, just as the sister of Yusor, Razan, who was visiting in the afternoon."</seg>
<seg id="376">He shot at Deah eight times.</seg>
<seg id="377">Fanaticism can not only be immoral but also fatal.</seg>
<seg id="378">So back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="379">What happened after 9 / 11?</seg>
<seg id="380">Did we go to the mosque or did we stay safe at home?</seg>
<seg id="381">"we discussed it and for us it was not an easy decision, because it was about what America we want to leave to our children: one that would control us through fear, or one in which we can exercise our religion freely."</seg>
<seg id="382">We decided for the mosque.</seg>
<seg id="383">"with our son in the child's seat we drove silently, with high pressure to the mosque."</seg>
<seg id="384">"I took him out, went out of my shoes, went to the house of prayer, and what I saw I stopped."</seg>
<seg id="385">The hall was completely filled.</seg>
<seg id="386">"then the Imam made an announcement, thanked and welcomed our guests, as half of the assembled were Christians, Jews, Buddhists, atheists, believers and non-believers who came not to attack us, but to assist us."</seg>
<seg id="387">At this moment I have collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="388">These people were there because they had pretended courage and compassion and prejudice.</seg>
<seg id="389">What will you choose?</seg>
<seg id="390">What will you choose in the moment of fear and fanaticism?</seg>
<seg id="391">Will you be safe on number?</seg>
<seg id="392">Or will you join those who think: we are better than yours.</seg>
<seg id="393">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="394">Thank you very much!</seg>
<seg id="395">Helen Walters: so Dalia; you seem to have hit a nerve.</seg>
<seg id="396">"but I wonder what you say to those who might say that you are holding a TEDTalk, a thinker with draught, working in a noble thought factory, so an exception and not the rule."</seg>
<seg id="397">What would you say to those people?</seg>
<seg id="398">"Dalia Mogahed: I would say, do not deceive. I am completely normal."</seg>

<seg id="408">"control, environmental monitoring, photography, film and journalism: these are some of the possible applications for commercial drones. this is made possible in research facilities worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="409">"before air-parcel delivery in our social consciousness penetrated, an autonomous fleet of flying machines at the FRAC Centre in France has built a six-meter high tower consisting of 1 500 bricks. some years ago, they began to fly with ropes."</seg>
<seg id="410">"by connecting terminals, air units achieve high speed and acceleration in the smallest space."</seg>
<seg id="411">You can also build self-relieving structures independently.</seg>
<seg id="412">"they have learned to bear burdens, deal with turbulence and generally respond to natural laws."</seg>
<seg id="413">Today we would like to show you some of our new projects.</seg>
<seg id="414">Our goal is to cross the limits of possibilities in the autonomous flight.</seg>
<seg id="415">"in order for a system to operate autonomously, it must be collectively known where the mobile objects are located in the room."</seg>
<seg id="416">"in our laboratory at ETH Zurich, we often use external cameras to find objects. this enables us to concentrate on the rapid development of dynamic tasks."</seg>
<seg id="417">"for today's demos, we use a new localization technology from Verity Studios, a publisher of our laboratory."</seg>
<seg id="418">There are no external cameras.</seg>
<seg id="419">Each flight machine has internal sensors to determine the position in the room to determine calculations on board what the machine should do.</seg>
<seg id="420">"external commands are available at the highest level, e.g." "start" "and" "land". ""</seg>
<seg id="421">"this is a so-called rear starter,"</seg>
<seg id="422">A flight device trying to beat two flies with a flap.</seg>
<seg id="423">"like other starter motors, it is efficient in forward flight, much more efficient than helicopters in all their variations."</seg>
<seg id="424">"in contrast to most of the star-gliders it can float, and has great advantages when starting and landing, and is very versatile."</seg>
<seg id="425">"however, there is always a downside."</seg>
<seg id="426">A limitation of hedge-starters is that they react sensitively to turbulence like wind bucks.</seg>
<seg id="427">We develop new controls and algorithms to improve this.</seg>
<seg id="428">The idea behind this is that the flight device does not matter in what position the optimum position is regained and the performance can be improved by practicing.</seg>
<seg id="429">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="430">"during our research, we often ask ourselves basic abstract questions that advance to the core of the matter."</seg>
<seg id="431">"one such question would be, for example: what is the smallest possible number of moving parts for controlled flights?"</seg>
<seg id="432">There are practical reasons for wanting to know the answer to such a question.</seg>
<seg id="433">"helicopters are known as machines with thousands of moving parts, which assemble to hurt you."</seg>
<seg id="434">"decades ago, trained pilots were able to fly remote-controlled flying machines that only had two moving parts: a propeller and a stern rudder."</seg>
<seg id="435">"recently, we discovered that flying with only one works."</seg>
<seg id="436">"this is the Monospinner, the mechanically simple remote-operated flight device. it was invented recently."</seg>
<seg id="437">"it has only one moving part, a propeller,"</seg>
<seg id="438">"no flaps, hinges and lateral rudder, no further actuators or control surfaces, only one propeller."</seg>
<seg id="439">"although it is mechanically simple, the inner life happens very much so that it can fly stable and move everywhere in the room."</seg>
<seg id="440">"nevertheless, it does not have the elegant algorithm of the stern roller. to bring it to fly, I have to throw it right correctly."</seg>
<seg id="441">"the chance to throw it right, if everyone watch me is small, so I'll show you a video that was filmed last night."</seg>
<seg id="442">"if the monster is an exercise in cruelty, this machine is here, the Omnikopter with its eight propellers, an exercise in abundance."</seg>
<seg id="443">What to do with all this abundance?</seg>
<seg id="444">They see that it is only symmetrical.</seg>
<seg id="445">"therefore, it is ambivalent in its orientation."</seg>
<seg id="446">"as a result, he receives the aural skill,"</seg>
<seg id="447">"moving in the room in all directions, no matter which direction it rotates or even how it rotates."</seg>
<seg id="448">"of course, it is complex, mainly in the area of interactive rivers from the eight propellers."</seg>
<seg id="449">"a lot is conceivable in models, the rest is learned right when flying."</seg>
<seg id="450">Let's take a look at this.</seg>
<seg id="451">"if flying machines are to be part of our everyday life, they must be extremely secure and reliable."</seg>
<seg id="452">This machine consists of two separate two propeller flying machines.</seg>
<seg id="453">This rotates clockwise</seg>
<seg id="454">And the other anti-clockwise.</seg>
<seg id="455">"if you build them together, they act like a high-performance quadrocopter."</seg>
<seg id="456">"if something goes wrong, a motor or propeller drops off, the electronics or a battery -- can continue to fly the machine if it is limited."</seg>
<seg id="457">We will demonstrate this by making one half incapacitated.</seg>
<seg id="458">The last demonstration investigates synthetic chimeras.</seg>
<seg id="459">"the large number of autonomous, coordinated units enables a range of aesthetic expression."</seg>
<seg id="460">We took standard micro-quadcopter -- each single weighs less than one slice of bread -- and equip it with localization technology and algorithms.</seg>
<seg id="461">Each unit knows where in space it is and is self-controlled. that is why there is no upper limit.</seg>
<seg id="462">Hopefully you motivate these demonstrations to think about new revolutionary ideas.</seg>
<seg id="463">"the particularly safe machine, on the other hand, wants to be a flying lampshade on Broadway."</seg>
<seg id="464">"of course, it is difficult to predict the impact of this technology."</seg>
<seg id="465">For types like us is the reward in the development and the creative act.</seg>
<seg id="466">"it serves as a reminder, how wonderful and enchanting our universe is, and that it allows creative, clever creatures to form it in such a spectacular way."</seg>
<seg id="467">The fact that this technology has such massive commercial and economic potential is the icing on the cake.</seg>
<seg id="468">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="469">"1.3 billion years ago, two black holes circled each other in a very far distant galaxy, so they converted the mass of three suns to pure energy in a tenth of a second."</seg>
<seg id="470">"this short moment, they shone more brightly than all the stars in all galaxies of the entire universe known to us."</seg>
<seg id="471">It was a very big bang.</seg>
<seg id="472">But they did not set up their energy in the form of light --</seg>
<seg id="473">We finally speak of black holes.</seg>
<seg id="474">The whole energy was released into space-time-structure itself and the universe exploded in gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="475">Let us first arrange the events temporally.</seg>
<seg id="476">"1.3 billion years ago, there was just a multi-cell life on Earth."</seg>
<seg id="477">"since then, the Earth has produced a lot: corals, fish, plants, dinosaurs, humans and -- God stands for us -- even the internet."</seg>
<seg id="478">"about 25 years ago, a group of particularly courageous -- Rai Weiss from MIT, Kip Thorne and Ronald Drever from the Caltech -- decided to build a huge laser detector in order to look for gravitational waves, which are caused by colliding black holes."</seg>
<seg id="479">Most of them considered them crazy.</seg>
<seg id="480">But enough people recognized them as crazy geniuses so that the US National Science Foundation financed their idea.</seg>
<seg id="481">"after decades of development, design, conception and extremely hard work they built the detector Ligo: the laser interferometer gravitational-waves observatory."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the follow-up period, the precision of Ligo was significantly increased, which greatly improved the recognition performance."</seg>
<seg id="483">"therefore, it is called Advanced Ligo."</seg>
<seg id="484">"at the beginning of September 2015, Ligo was launched for a last test run to clarify some minor, persistent problems."</seg>
<seg id="485">"on September 14, 2015, just a few days after the detector was commissioned, the gravitational-waves of the two colliding black holes filled through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="486">They went through you and me</seg>
<seg id="487">And also through the detector.</seg>
<seg id="488">Scott Hughes: only two moments in my life were more emotional than this:</seg>
<seg id="489">The birth of my daughter</seg>
<seg id="490">And the farewell from my death-sick father.</seg>
<seg id="491">Basically it was the fruits of my life.</seg>
<seg id="492">"AA: this is my very good friend and colleague Scott Hughes, theoretical physicist at MIT. he has been studying gravitational waves from black holes for 23 years and her through observatories like Ligo measurable signals. but what are gravitational waves?"</seg>
<seg id="493">A gravitational-wave is a crow in the structure of space and time.</seg>
<seg id="494">"when passing the wave, the space and its entire content are stretched in one direction and put into the other."</seg>
<seg id="495">Teachers in courses of relativity theory often lead to a truly brilliant dance.</seg>
<seg id="496">"stretch and dustow, stretch and dustow."</seg>
<seg id="497">"the problem is that gravitational waves are extremely weak, even ridiculous."</seg>
<seg id="498">"on September 14th, for example, each one of us was stretched and polished at the arrival of the waves. the stretching of an average man was 10 high -21."</seg>
<seg id="499">"that means 20 zeros after the comma, followed by a 1."</seg>
<seg id="500">"with a five-kilometre laser detector, and that is already absurd, this length would have to be measured in less than a thousandth of the radius of an atomic nucleus. this is grotesque."</seg>
<seg id="501">At the end of his classical text about gravity</seg>
<seg id="502">"Kip Thorne, a co-founder of Ligos, described the hunt for the waves as follows:" the technical difficulties in building such detectors are enormous. "</seg>
<seg id="503">But physicists are inventive and with the support of the public all obstacles will be overcome. "</seg>
<seg id="504">"Thorne published this in 1973, 42 years before his success."</seg>
<seg id="505">Back to Ligo. Scott likes to say that Ligo is more an ear than an eye.</seg>
<seg id="506">I would like to explain what this means.</seg>
<seg id="507">"visible light has a wavelength, which is much smaller than the things around us: facial features, the size of your cell."</seg>
<seg id="508">"this is quite practical, because you can customize a picture or a map of things by observing the light coming from several points around you."</seg>
<seg id="509">With sounds this is different.</seg>
<seg id="510">Audible sounds have a wavelength of up to 15 meters.</seg>
<seg id="511">"this is why it is very difficult, actually impossible to produce a picture of things that mean a lot to you:"</seg>
<seg id="512">About your child's face.</seg>
<seg id="513">"instead, we listen to certain characteristics such as pitch and pitch, rhythm and volume to close the story behind it."</seg>
<seg id="514">"now just speaks Alice."</seg>
<seg id="515">"and Bob interrupts her."</seg>
<seg id="516">"stupid Bob, too."</seg>
<seg id="517">The same goes for gravitational waves.</seg>
<seg id="518">We cannot make simple pictures of objects in space with them.</seg>
<seg id="519">"but by paying attention to changes in amplitude and frequency of the waves, we can listen to their stories."</seg>
<seg id="520">At least for Ligo there are the measured frequencies in the audible range.</seg>
<seg id="521">"so when we convert wave patterns into sound, we can literally hear the universe speak."</seg>
<seg id="522">"to listen to the gravity, we can tell us much about the collision of two black holes, which my colleague Scott has already occupied for quite a long time."</seg>
<seg id="523">"SH: two black, non-rotating holes, just chirp: wupp!"</seg>
<seg id="524">"if the two bodies rotate very quickly, one hears the same chirping with an additional key change. this sounds like this: Wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu-wu!"</seg>
<seg id="525">"it is a kind of movement vocabulary, marked in the waveform."</seg>
<seg id="526">"AA: on September 14, 2015 -- a date that at least I will never forget -- Ligo heard the following: [Surrender's noise] Somebody, who knows what to hear, acknowledges this as a sound of -- SH:... two black holes with 30-fold solar mass, which rotate around as fast as the rods of your mixer."</seg>
<seg id="527">AA: let's think about what this means.</seg>
<seg id="528">"two black holes, the densest body in space, one with a mass of 29 suns, the other with a mass of 36 suns, revolve hundred times a second before they collide."</seg>
<seg id="529">Imagine these forces.</seg>
<seg id="530">Fantastic.</seg>
<seg id="531">And we know because we heard it.</seg>
<seg id="532">Therein lies the permanent meaning of Ligo.</seg>
<seg id="533">Ligo is paving the way for the exploration of the universe as it had never been possible before.</seg>
<seg id="534">On this path we can listen to the universe and hear the invisible.</seg>
<seg id="535">"much in space, we can -- practically or basically -- not see."</seg>
<seg id="536">"a Supernova, for example. I would like to know why massereiche stars explode in Supernovae."</seg>
<seg id="537">They are very useful. from them we learned a lot about the universe.</seg>
<seg id="538">"the exciting physical processes occur at the core, which lies hidden behind thousands of kilometers of iron, carbon and silicon."</seg>
<seg id="539">We will never go through because these are opaque.</seg>
<seg id="540">"gravitational waves penetrate iron as if it were transparent glass. the Big Bang: I would like to explore the first minutes of the universe, but we will never see them since the Big Bang is obscured by its own afterglow."</seg>
<seg id="541">Using gravity waves it should be possible to look back to the beginning.</seg>
<seg id="542">"and most importantly: I am optimistic that in all things we have never seen, which we will never see and of which we have no idea. things that we only discover by listening."</seg>
<seg id="543">"in fact, Ligo found things right in the first attempt that we did not expect."</seg>
<seg id="544">"my colleague at MIT, Matt Evans, an important member of the Ligo project, says to this topic: me: the kind of stars that produce black holes, as Ligo watches them, are the dinosaurs of the universe."</seg>
<seg id="545">"the black holes are the suckers for our archaeological work, so to speak."</seg>
<seg id="546">"Ligo gives us a totally different perspective on the happenings in space, the emergence of the stars and ultimately also on how we emerged from this chaos."</seg>
<seg id="547">AA: the challenge now consists in being as brave as possible.</seg>
<seg id="548">"thanks to Ligo, we know how to build great detectors and listen to the noise and chirping of the cosmos."</seg>
<seg id="549">We need ideas for new observatories -- a whole new generation of observatories on earth and in space.</seg>
<seg id="550">For what could be nicer than listening to the Big Bang?</seg>
<seg id="551">Now is the time of great dreams.</seg>
<seg id="552">Do you dream with us?</seg>
<seg id="553">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="554">"some time ago, I tried an experiment."</seg>
<seg id="555">"for one year I would say" "Yes", "in front of which I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="556">"no matter if it made me nervous, brought me into unpleasant situations, I forced myself to say" "yes". ""</seg>
<seg id="557">Did I want to speak to the public?</seg>
<seg id="558">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="559">Did I want to be live on TV?</seg>
<seg id="560">"no, but yes!"</seg>
<seg id="561">Did I want to start with the show?</seg>
<seg id="562">"no, no, no, yes, yes, yes."</seg>
<seg id="563">"and a crazy thing happened: exactly what to do, whereas I was afraid, removed my fear."</seg>
<seg id="564">"my fear to keep talking, my social anxiety -- puff, away."</seg>
<seg id="565">The power of a word is impressive.</seg>
<seg id="566">"yes" has changed my life.</seg>
<seg id="567">"yes," changed me. "</seg>
<seg id="568">But there was a certain yes that deeply changed my life. it began with a matter of my smallest ones.</seg>
<seg id="569">"I have three incredible daughters, Harper, Beckett and Emerson. and Emerson, the smallest, calls all" "kitten" "for inexplicable reasons,"</seg>
<seg id="570">As if she were a waitress from the south.</seg>
<seg id="571">"kittens, I need milk for my Schnabeltasse."</seg>
<seg id="572">"she asked me once, if I could play with her when I was on the go. and I said," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="573">This yes was the beginning</seg>
<seg id="574">"from then on, I swear to always play with them once you ask me. no matter what I'm doing, or where I go, I always say Yes -- every single time."</seg>
<seg id="575">"almost. I'm not perfect, but I'm very tired."</seg>
<seg id="576">"it has a magical effect on me, my children, to our family."</seg>
<seg id="577">"but it also has an amazing side effect: only recently I understood fully that the" "yes" "to play with my children saved my career."</seg>
<seg id="578">I have a real dream job.</seg>
<seg id="579">I am the author. I think things are awaking you to life.</seg>
<seg id="580">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="581">No.</seg>
<seg id="582">I am a Titan.</seg>
<seg id="583">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="584">I scream television. I produce television.</seg>
<seg id="585">"I make television, in a great style."</seg>
<seg id="586">In this TV-season I am responsible for carrying out 70 hours of program into the world.</seg>
<seg id="587">"four TV programmes, 70 hours of television. three to four shows are simultaneously in production."</seg>
<seg id="588">Each mission offers hundreds of jobs that did not exist before.</seg>
<seg id="589">The budget for an episode of a TV station can be between three and six million dollars.</seg>
<seg id="590">Let us say five.</seg>
<seg id="591">"a new episode every nine days once four shows, thus every nine days 20 million dollar television, four TV programs, 70 hours TV, three broadcasts that are simultaneously in production four times four, 16 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: scandal, 15 episodes: the Catch, 70 hours television,"</seg>
<seg id="592">350 million dollars for a season.</seg>
<seg id="593">In America my TV series run after each other on Thursday evening.</seg>
<seg id="594">"all over the world, my series run in 256 regions in 67 languages for 30 million viewers."</seg>
<seg id="595">"my brain is global, and 45 of these 70 TV-hours are broadcasts that I have created myself and not only produced, so on top of it. I have to find time, really quiet, creative time to gather my fans around the campfire and to tell my stories."</seg>
<seg id="596">"four TV series, 70 hours of television, three, sometimes four, shows at the same time in production, 350 million dollars, campfires burning around the world."</seg>
<seg id="597">Do you know who is doing that yet?</seg>
<seg id="598">"nobody, therefore, I am a Titan."</seg>
<seg id="599">Dream job.</seg>
<seg id="600">I don't want to impress you with that.</seg>
<seg id="601">I say it because I know what you think when the word "author" falls.</seg>
<seg id="602">"I say it to you, that all of you who work as hard as you are now running a company, a country or a classroom, take me seriously if I speak of work, so that you understand that I am not just lying on the computer and fanciful, and it is true when I say that it does not dream for a dream job."</seg>
<seg id="603">"it's all a job, all work, all reality, all blood, all sweat -- no tears."</seg>
<seg id="604">"I work a lot, hard and I love it."</seg>
<seg id="605">"when I'm immersed in the work, there is no other feeling."</seg>
<seg id="606">My work always creates a country out of nothing.</seg>
<seg id="607">It is as if I set up troops as I painted on a canvas.</seg>
<seg id="608">"as a result, one gets a high note, running a marathon."</seg>
<seg id="609">You feel like Beyoncé.</seg>
<seg id="610">And all this at the same time.</seg>
<seg id="611">I love to work.</seg>
<seg id="612">"it is creative, mechanical, exhausting and intoxicating, funny and disturbing, clinically and maternal, cruel and sensible."</seg>
<seg id="613">There is such a change in me when the work goes well.</seg>
<seg id="614">"a humming starts in my head, and it grows and grows, and the humming sounds like a busy road, I could go on it forever."</seg>
<seg id="615">"many people accept when I declare to them the sums, that I am persuaded that writing gives me joy."</seg>
<seg id="616">"don't get me wrong, you do."</seg>
<seg id="617">"but the sums -- when I began working and working with television, when I started working and doing, building, creating and working together, I discovered this thing, this humming, this energy."</seg>
<seg id="618">The sums are more than writing.</seg>
<seg id="619">The humming is action and activity. the humming is a drug.</seg>
<seg id="620">The sums are music. the humming is light and air.</seg>
<seg id="621">The humming is God's voice in my ear.</seg>
<seg id="622">"and if you have such sums, you can't strive for size differently."</seg>
<seg id="623">"the feeling of not being able to look different than to strive for size, no matter what price."</seg>
<seg id="624">This is called Summa.</seg>
<seg id="625">Or perhaps it means being a workaholic.</seg>
<seg id="626">Maybe it's called genius.</seg>
<seg id="627">Perhaps ego is called ego.</seg>
<seg id="628">Perhaps it is fear of failure.</seg>
<seg id="629">I don't know.</seg>
<seg id="630">"I only know that I'm not doomed for failure, and I just know that I love the buzz."</seg>
<seg id="631">"I just want to tell you, I am a Titan, and I know I don't want to question it."</seg>
<seg id="632">"the more successful I become, the more episodes, the more blurred boundaries, the more work there is, the more things I write, the more I write history, the more expectations there is."</seg>
<seg id="633">"the more I work to be successful, the more I have to work."</seg>
<seg id="634">And what did I say about work?</seg>
<seg id="635">"I love work, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="636">"the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone, the humming, the humming, the humming."</seg>
<seg id="637">I like this buzz. I love the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="638">I need the sums. I am the buzz.</seg>
<seg id="639">Am I just this buzz?</seg>
<seg id="640">And then the humming stopped.</seg>
<seg id="641">"overloaded, overloaded, overdone, burnt out."</seg>
<seg id="642">The sums stopped.</seg>
<seg id="643">Now my three daughters are used to the truth that their mom is a single working institute.</seg>
<seg id="644">"Harper tells people:" my mum will not be there, but you can write my Nanny. "</seg>
<seg id="645">"and Emerson says:" "kittens, I want to go to Shonda-Land."</seg>
<seg id="646">It is the children of a Titans.</seg>
<seg id="647">They are baby Titans.</seg>
<seg id="648">"they were 12, 3 and 1, when the sums were stopped."</seg>
<seg id="649">The buzz of the engine was speechless.</seg>
<seg id="650">I no longer loved my work. the engine was out.</seg>
<seg id="651">The sums did not come back.</seg>
<seg id="652">My humming was broken.</seg>
<seg id="653">"I did the same things as always: the same Titans work, 15 hours-days, worked weekends, no remorse, nothing delegate, a Titan does not sleep, does not give up, with whole heart, clear eyes, whatever."</seg>
<seg id="654">But there was no humming.</seg>
<seg id="655">In me was silence.</seg>
<seg id="656">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions at the same time, sometimes four."</seg>
<seg id="657">"four TV programs, 70 hours, three productions simultaneously..."</seg>
<seg id="658">I was the perfect Titan.</seg>
<seg id="659">"I was a pre-show Titan,"</seg>
<seg id="660">"everything was grey, I simply had no more fun."</seg>
<seg id="661">And that was my life.</seg>
<seg id="662">Everything I did.</seg>
<seg id="663">I was the buzz and the buzz I was.</seg>
<seg id="664">"so what do you do when what you do, the work you love, suddenly fade away?"</seg>
<seg id="665">"I know some may think," "Today, stupid author Titan."</seg>
<seg id="666">"but you know you do it, you do, you are working, you love what you're doing to be a teacher, a banker, a mother, a painter, Bill Gates, you just love another and that gives you the sum if you already knew the sums, who is you then?"</seg>
<seg id="667">What are you?</seg>
<seg id="668">What am I?</seg>
<seg id="669">Am I still a Titan?</seg>
<seg id="670">"when the song of my heart stops, can I survive in silence?"</seg>
<seg id="671">And then my "southern states waitress" asks me a question.</seg>
<seg id="672">"I'm on the way out, late, and she says:" "mum, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="673">And I don't want to say No when I am aware of two things:</seg>
<seg id="674">"first, I must say yes to everything and secondly, she called me not" "kitten". ""</seg>
<seg id="675">She does not call anyone any longer.</seg>
<seg id="676">When did that happen?</seg>
<seg id="677">"I miss it when I am Titan and mourn my humming, and everything changes in front of my own eyes."</seg>
<seg id="678">"and so she says," "Mum, do you like playing?"</seg>
<seg id="679">"and I say," Yes. ""</seg>
<seg id="680">There is nothing special about it.</seg>
<seg id="681">"we play and their sisters come across, we laugh a lot and I read quite dramatically from the book" Everybody Poops. ""</seg>
<seg id="682">Nothing extraordinary.</seg>
<seg id="683">"but it is outstanding because my pain and panic, in loneliness and absence of money, I can't do anything except watch out."</seg>
<seg id="684">I am focused.</seg>
<seg id="685">I am quiet.</seg>
<seg id="686">"the country I created, the marathon, which I run, the army, the screen, the high tone - they no longer exist."</seg>
<seg id="687">"everything that exists is sticky fingers and moist kisses, delicate voices, wax crayons and the song in which it's about letting go, or whatever the girl in" "The Ice Queen". ""</seg>
<seg id="688">Everywhere is peace and simplicity.</seg>
<seg id="689">The air in this place is so short that I can hardly breathe.</seg>
<seg id="690">I can hardly believe that I breathe.</seg>
<seg id="691">Playing is the opposite of works.</seg>
<seg id="692">And I am happy.</seg>
<seg id="693">Something inside me dissolves.</seg>
<seg id="694">A mental door goes up and an energy boost comes in.</seg>
<seg id="695">"and that not right away, but it happens, it happens."</seg>
<seg id="696">I feel it.</seg>
<seg id="697">The humming is slowly coming back.</seg>
<seg id="698">"no full volume, hardly there, it's quiet, barely audible, but it's there."</seg>
<seg id="699">"not the sums, but a sum."</seg>
<seg id="700">And now I feel like I know a magic secret.</seg>
<seg id="701">But let's stay with the matter.</seg>
<seg id="702">It is love. that's all.</seg>
<seg id="703">No magic. no secret. only love.</seg>
<seg id="704">It is something we have forgotten.</seg>
<seg id="705">"the sums, the sums of work, the titanium sum, that is just the replacement."</seg>
<seg id="706">"if I ask you who you are, if I tell you who I am, when I describe myself with the help of broadcasts and television hours and how working my brain is, then I forgot what the real sums are."</seg>
<seg id="707">The sums are not strength and it is not labour-specific.</seg>
<seg id="708">It depends on the joy.</seg>
<seg id="709">The real sum is dependent on love.</seg>
<seg id="710">The sum is the current that comes from the lust of life.</seg>
<seg id="711">The real sums are self-confidence and peace.</seg>
<seg id="712">"the real sum ignores the pressure of history, the tasks to be done, the expectation and the pressure."</seg>
<seg id="713">The real sum is simple and original.</seg>
<seg id="714">"true humming is God's voice in my ear, but perhaps God whispered to me the wrong words, for which God said to me that I am a Titan?"</seg>
<seg id="715">It is just love.</seg>
<seg id="716">"we all need a bit more love, much more love."</seg>
<seg id="717">"as soon as my child wants to play with me, I will say yes."</seg>
<seg id="718">"I do this as a rule, so that I can free myself as a workaholic of any guilt."</seg>
<seg id="719">"it is law, I have no choice. I have no choice if I want to hear the humming again."</seg>
<seg id="720">"I wish it would be so simple. I'm not good in playing, I don't like it."</seg>
<seg id="721">Playing is not enough for me as to how to work.</seg>
<seg id="722">"the truth hurts,"</seg>
<seg id="723">But I don't like to play it.</seg>
<seg id="724">I always work because I love it.</seg>
<seg id="725">I prefer working at the workplace than at home.</seg>
<seg id="726">"this admission is painful, because what a person prefers to work rather than being home?"</seg>
<seg id="727">"well yes, I."</seg>
<seg id="728">"honestly, I call myself" Titan. ""</seg>
<seg id="729">I have to have problems.</seg>
<seg id="730">That I am too relaxed is none of them.</seg>
<seg id="731">"we rush around in the garden, before and back, back and forth."</seg>
<seg id="732">"we make small dance parties,"</seg>
<seg id="733">We sing and play ball.</seg>
<seg id="734">We crumble soap bubbles.</seg>
<seg id="735">"I feel mostly stiff, absent and confused."</seg>
<seg id="736">I always take my phone.</seg>
<seg id="737">But it is ok.</seg>
<seg id="738">"my children show me how to live, and the humming of the universe fulfills me."</seg>
<seg id="739">I play and play until I ask myself: why have we ever stopped playing?</seg>
<seg id="740">You can also say it! always say yes if your child wants to play with you.</seg>
<seg id="741">Perhaps you keep me naive for a daydream.</seg>
<seg id="742">"you are right, but you can do it too!"</seg>
<seg id="743">You have time!</seg>
<seg id="744">And do you know why? they're not Rihanna or a Muppet Show character.</seg>
<seg id="745">Your child will find you less interesting than you think.</seg>
<seg id="746">It is only 15 minutes.</seg>
<seg id="747">"my little ones want to play with me at most 15 minutes, until they think they want to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="748">"it is wonderful 15 minutes, but just 15 minutes."</seg>
<seg id="749">After 15 minutes a ladybug or biscuit is replaced.</seg>
<seg id="750">"and talking my teen-daughter for 15 minutes with me, I am the mother of the year."</seg>
<seg id="751">"there are only 15 minutes, more is not needed."</seg>
<seg id="752">"each one can take 15 minutes on the piece, even on a bad mood-day!"</seg>
<seg id="753">15 minutes in the play!</seg>
<seg id="754">"no mobile phone, no laundry, no distraction."</seg>
<seg id="755">"the day is short: dinner, the children are ready to pray."</seg>
<seg id="756">But 15 minutes are in it!</seg>
<seg id="757">"my children are my well-being, my world. they don't have to be the children. it's important to feel the humming, having a place for peace of mind."</seg>
<seg id="758">"it's not about playing with your own children. it's about joy,"</seg>
<seg id="759">"in order to" "play" "in general."</seg>
<seg id="760">Treat yourself to the 15 minutes!</seg>
<seg id="761">Find out what you do well.</seg>
<seg id="762">Find out and maintain it.</seg>
<seg id="763">"I'm not perfect in it. I'll fail and I'll win. friends meet, read books, enjoy the day --"</seg>
<seg id="764">"do you want to play?" "stands briefly for everything I've given up when I got my first TV show when I was a Titan in the training, when I wanted to surpass myself more and more."</seg>
<seg id="765">15 minutes in the play why not treat yourself to 15 minutes?</seg>
<seg id="766">What can be wrong with it? nothing!</seg>
<seg id="767">The sums came back in my spare time. the sums seem to return when I don't work.</seg>
<seg id="768">Working does not work without playing.</seg>
<seg id="769">"it takes time, but after a few months a door opens, the energy flows in and I find myself again in my office. I hear an unknown melody, it fills me and my soul."</seg>
<seg id="770">"I like the buzz, but I don't love it."</seg>
<seg id="771">I don't need it.</seg>
<seg id="772">"I'm not the buzz, the buzz is not me... no more."</seg>
<seg id="773">"soap bubbles and sticky fingers, dinner with friends."</seg>
<seg id="774">This is my humming now.</seg>
<seg id="775">The humming of life.</seg>
<seg id="776">The Summa of Love.</seg>
<seg id="777">"the sum of the work is part of me, but just one part. and I am so thankful for that."</seg>
<seg id="778">It's snapped to me that I am a Titan. I have never seen a Titan who plays a trip to Jerusalem.</seg>
<seg id="779">I said yes to less work and more games.</seg>
<seg id="780">And yet I have everything under control. my brain is still functioning. my campfire is still burning.</seg>
<seg id="781">"the more I play, the happier I and my children."</seg>
<seg id="782">"the more I play, the more I feel as a good mother."</seg>
<seg id="783">"the more I play, the more clear my head is."</seg>
<seg id="784">"the more I play, the better I work."</seg>
<seg id="785">"the more I play, the more I hear the humming. the land I created, the marathon, which I run, the troops, the canvases, the high tone, the humming, the humming, the other, the right sum: the humming of life."</seg>
<seg id="786">"the more I feel this buzz, the more this unusual, dying, naked and new feeling of life in me is wide. less Titan -- more I!"</seg>
<seg id="787">"the more I feel this hum, the more I know who I am."</seg>
<seg id="788">"I am the author. I think things out, I wake you up to life."</seg>
<seg id="789">"this is part of the job, which means living his dream."</seg>
<seg id="790">"this is the dream of this job,"</seg>
<seg id="791">Because a dream job should be a little dreamy.</seg>
<seg id="792">"I said" "Yes" "to less work and more games."</seg>
<seg id="793">Titans have no chance here.</seg>
<seg id="794">"want to play?"</seg>
<seg id="795">Thank you very much.</seg>
<seg id="796">I am a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="797">"like most of my colleagues, I have to do with human tragedies every day."</seg>
<seg id="798">"I know how your life can change from one second to another, after a heavy stroke or after a car accident."</seg>
<seg id="799">"for us neurosurgeons it is very frustrating that the brain, unlike other body organs, has a very low ability to self-healing."</seg>
<seg id="800">"after a serious injury to the central nervous system, patients often have a permanent, severe disability."</seg>
<seg id="801">This is probably the reason why I became a neurosurgeon.</seg>
<seg id="802">What is a functional neurosurgeon?</seg>
<seg id="803">A doctor who tries to improve the nerve functions by various surgical measures.</seg>
<seg id="804">"they certainly have heard of one of the best known, the" deep-brain stimulation. "in doing so, one implantiates an electrode deep in the brain to influence the neuron circuits in such a way that the neurological function improves."</seg>
<seg id="805">It really is an amazing technology. it has improved the fate of patients with Parkinson's disease who suffered from severe tremors and severe pain.</seg>
<seg id="806">Neuromodulation does not mean neuro-healing.</seg>
<seg id="807">The dream of functional neurosurgeon is the restoration of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="808">"in my opinion, we approach this dream."</seg>
<seg id="809">I would like to show you that we are very close to you.</seg>
<seg id="810">"with some help, the brain can help itself."</seg>
<seg id="811">The story began 15 years ago.</seg>
<seg id="812">"at that time I was a senior physician, working day and night in the emergency room."</seg>
<seg id="813">Often I supplied patients with skull-brain trauma.</seg>
<seg id="814">"you must imagine that in skull-brain traumas, the brain becomes unwilling and the cranial pressure increases."</seg>
<seg id="815">"in order to save life, you have to lessen the pressure of the skull."</seg>
<seg id="816">Sometimes you have to remove a part of swollen brain mass.</seg>
<seg id="817">"instead of throwing away the swollen brain mass, we decided to analyse the brain mass with Jean-François Brunet, one of my colleagues."</seg>
<seg id="818">What do I mean by that?</seg>
<seg id="819">We wanted to make cells grow from this tissue.</seg>
<seg id="820">This is not an easy task.</seg>
<seg id="821">"to make cells grow from a tissue piece, is comparable to all small children who are taken out of your families."</seg>
<seg id="822">"you have to find the right diet, temperature, humidity, and environments to thrive them."</seg>
<seg id="823">That is exactly what we had to do with these cells.</seg>
<seg id="824">"after many attempts, Jean-François was eliminated."</seg>
<seg id="825">He saw that under his microscope.</seg>
<seg id="826">That was a big surprise for us.</seg>
<seg id="827">Why?</seg>
<seg id="828">"it looked exactly like a stem cell culture. with large green cells surrounded by small, unripe cells."</seg>
<seg id="829">"perhaps you still know from the biology class that stem cells are unripe cells, which can transform into any cell type of the organism."</seg>
<seg id="830">"the adult brain has stem cells, but very few. they are hidden in deep, small niches of the brain."</seg>
<seg id="831">It is surprising to obtain this kind of stem cells from the surface tissue of the brain mass in the surgery.</seg>
<seg id="832">We made another fascinating observation: normal stem cells are very active -- they share very quickly.</seg>
<seg id="833">They never die; they are immortal.</seg>
<seg id="834">But these cells behaved differently.</seg>
<seg id="835">They split slowly and after a few weeks they even died.</seg>
<seg id="836">"so we saw a new strange cell population, which looked like stem cells, but behaved differently."</seg>
<seg id="837">We needed long to understand where they came from.</seg>
<seg id="838">They originate from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="839">These blue and red cells are called Doublecortin-positive cells.</seg>
<seg id="840">We all have them in our brain.</seg>
<seg id="841">They make up 4% of our cerebral cortex cells.</seg>
<seg id="842">They play a very important role in our development.</seg>
<seg id="843">In the fetus stage they care for the folding of the brain.</seg>
<seg id="844">But why do they stay with us?</seg>
<seg id="845">We don't know that.</seg>
<seg id="846">"we believe that they participate in the healing of the brain, as we find them in higher concentrations close to brain injuries."</seg>
<seg id="847">But this is not so sure.</seg>
<seg id="848">But one thing is clear -- we received our stem cells from these cells.</seg>
<seg id="849">We stand in front of a potential cell source that enables brain healing.</seg>
<seg id="850">We had to prove this.</seg>
<seg id="851">So we decided to develop an experiment.</seg>
<seg id="852">We wanted to extract a piece of brain from the non-linguistic area and then cultivate the cells just as it did Jean-François.</seg>
<seg id="853">And then they mark them in color in order to be able to follow them in the brain.</seg>
<seg id="854">"in the last step, we re-engineered it at the origin of the same individual."</seg>
<seg id="855">We call the autologous transplantation -- autografting.</seg>
<seg id="856">One of our first questions was: what happens when we re-establish these cells in normal brain tissue? and what will happen when we re-establish the same cells in damaged brain tissue?</seg>
<seg id="857">"thanks to the help of Prof. Eric Rouiller, we were able to work with apes."</seg>
<seg id="858">"in the first scenario we put the cells into a healthy brain and we observed that after a few weeks they disappeared altogether as if they were taken back, they go back home. the space is already occupied, they are not needed there, so they disappear."</seg>
<seg id="859">"in the second scenario, we inserted an injury and re-engineered precisely the same cells and now the cells remained -- they grew to mature neurons."</seg>
<seg id="860">Here you see what we could observe under the microscope.</seg>
<seg id="861">These are the cells that have been re-imported.</seg>
<seg id="862">"the evidence they show are these little points. these are the cells, which we stained in vitro, in culture."</seg>
<seg id="863">"of course, we could not stop here."</seg>
<seg id="864">Do these cells also help a monkey to recover from a brain injury?</seg>
<seg id="865">So we trained apes with a manual dexterity task.</seg>
<seg id="866">They had to take food pellets out of one tray.</seg>
<seg id="867">They made it very good.</seg>
<seg id="868">"when they reached a stable level of skill, we passed the motor skills range in the motor cortex."</seg>
<seg id="869">"then the monkeys were paralyzed, they could no longer move their hand."</seg>
<seg id="870">"just as it would happen in humans, they spontaneously recovered up to a certain degree, just like after a stroke."</seg>
<seg id="871">"the patients are paralyzed and then they try to recover with the help of plastic brain mechanisms. they recover to a certain degree, just as with apes."</seg>
<seg id="872">"when we were certain that the monkey had reached his degree of spontaneous recovery, we implanted his own cells."</seg>
<seg id="873">On the left you can see the monkey that recovered spontaneously.</seg>
<seg id="874">It can provide about 40% to 50% of its original performance from injury.</seg>
<seg id="875">It is not so precise and not so fast.</seg>
<seg id="876">"see now, when we re-planted the cells: the same monkey, two months after the explantation."</seg>
<seg id="877">I can tell you that they were also very exciting results for us.</seg>
<seg id="878">Since then we have found a lot more about these cells.</seg>
<seg id="879">We can freeze them and use them later.</seg>
<seg id="880">"we can use them in other neuropathological models, for example in Parkinson's disease."</seg>
<seg id="881">But our dream is still to implanted them in humans.</seg>
<seg id="882">I really hope that I will soon show you how the human brain gives us the means to heal yourself.</seg>
<seg id="883">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="884">"Bruno Giussani: Jocelyne, that's wonderful, I'm sure that just now, several dozen people in the audience, maybe even the majority, think:" I know someone who can take it. "</seg>
<seg id="885">I definitely.</seg>
<seg id="886">"of course, the question is what the biggest obstacles are before you can start clinical studies on humans."</seg>
<seg id="887">"Jocelyne Bloch: the biggest obstacles are the authorities. starting from these great results, you have to fill out about two kilograms of papers and forms to go through this type of studies."</seg>
<seg id="888">"BG: this is understandable, the brain is very delicate, etc."</seg>
<seg id="889">"JB: yes, but it takes a long time, a lot of patience and an almost professional team."</seg>
<seg id="890">"BG: look into the future -- you completed the research and tried to get permission to start clinical trials. if you continue to look into the future, how many years it will take until someone can come to hospital, and this therapy will be available."</seg>
<seg id="891">JB: it's hard to say.</seg>
<seg id="892">"first, it depends on the approval of the clinical trial."</seg>
<seg id="893">Will it allow us the authority to launch it soon?</seg>
<seg id="894">Then you have to carry out this study with a small group of patients.</seg>
<seg id="895">It takes a long time to select patients to perform treatments and assess whether it is useful to make this type of treatment.</seg>
<seg id="896">"after that, you have to apply it to a multi-centric study."</seg>
<seg id="897">First you really need to prove that it is useful before you can offer this treatment to anyone.</seg>
<seg id="898">"BG: and that it is safe, of course. JB: of course."</seg>

<seg id="901">Democracy.</seg>
<seg id="902">We in the West make a big mistake to consider them self-evident.</seg>
<seg id="903">"we see democracy not as the fragile plant it is in reality, but as an inventory of our society."</seg>
<seg id="904">We tend to consider them as immutable indebness.</seg>
<seg id="905">We believe that capitalism inevitably leads to democracy.</seg>
<seg id="906">This is not true.</seg>
<seg id="907">"Lee Kuan Yew from Singapore and his great followers in Beijing proved beyond doubt that it is quite possible to have a flourishing capitalism and impressive growth, while politics remains completely undemocratic."</seg>
<seg id="908">"in fact, democracy is dwindling with us, in Europe."</seg>
<seg id="909">"at the beginning of the year when I represented Greece -- the newly elected Greek government -- was made clear to me as the finance minister in the Eurogroup, that the democratic process of our country -- our elections -- should not influence the austerity programs implemented in Greece."</seg>
<seg id="910">"at that moment I thought that there could be no better justification for Lee Kuan Yew or the Communist Party of China, or some of my friends who repeatedly told me that democracy would be abolished if it would change anything."</seg>
<seg id="911">"at this point, I would like to present you an economic model for true democracy."</seg>
<seg id="912">"I ask you, together with me, to believe that Lee Kuan Yew, the Communist Party of China and even the Eurogroup succumbed to wrong belief, we could save democracy, but that we need a genuine and defensive democracy."</seg>
<seg id="913">"without democracy, our societies are brighter, our future is bleating and our great new technologies are wasted."</seg>
<seg id="914">"on the subject of waste, I would like to point you to an interesting contradiction that is currently under threat to our economies."</seg>
<seg id="915">"I call it the" "twin summit paradox". ""</seg>
<seg id="916">"a top is known to you. you know and recognize him as the mountain of debt, which casts his long shadow over the US, Europe and the whole world."</seg>
<seg id="917">"we all recognize the mountain of debt,"</seg>
<seg id="918">But few recognize his twin brother.</seg>
<seg id="919">"a mountain of unused cash, which belongs to the wealthy economists and corporations, who are too timid to invest there where it would be productive and income, with which one could pay the debt mountain and also produce all those things that humanity urgently needs, for example" green "energy."</seg>
<seg id="920">I call them two numbers.</seg>
<seg id="921">"over the past 3 months, 3,4 trillion US dollars were invested in the United States, England and the euro area, in all the wealth producing goods such as industrial plants, machinery, office buildings, schools, roads, tracks, equipment and so on and so forth."</seg>
<seg id="922">"$3.4 trillion will sound after a lot of money until it compares with the $5.1 trillion US dollars, which at the same time lay around in the same countries and our financial institutions, and did absolutely nothing to inflate the stock market prices."</seg>
<seg id="923">"thus, debt and unproductive capital form the twin summits, which are not offset by the usual market mechanisms."</seg>
<seg id="924">"the result is stagnant wages, more than a quarter of the 25-54-year-old unemployed in the US, Japan and Europe, and consequently a low macroeconomic demand, which, as in an endless loop, advocates the pessimism of investors, which, as in an endless loop, could be true that his son would kill him if he grows"</seg>
<seg id="925">Unintentionally bring about the circumstances that cause Oedipus to kill him.</seg>
<seg id="926">This is my strife with capitalism --</seg>
<seg id="927">"his extremely lavish art. all unproductive capital should be used to improve our lives, develop human talents and especially to finance all the technologies," green "technologies that are decisive for the salvation of the earth."</seg>
<seg id="928">Is democracy the solution?</seg>
<seg id="929">"but before we proceed, what do we mean by democracy?"</seg>
<seg id="930">Aristotle defined democracy as the form of society where the free and the poor control the government as a majority.</seg>
<seg id="931">"of course, the Athenian democracy ended too many."</seg>
<seg id="932">"women, foreigners, and of course slaves."</seg>
<seg id="933">But it would be a mistake to reduce the significance of the Athenian democracy due to these exclusions.</seg>
<seg id="934">"the decisive thing in the Athenian democracy was and is that it applied the working poor and not only gave them the right to freedom of expression, but more important and decisive, which gave them the right to political co-determination with the same mood of mood in questions of public prosecutor."</seg>
<seg id="935">The Athenian democracy did not last long --</seg>
<seg id="936">"like a candle that glows very brightly, it is also quickly burned out."</seg>
<seg id="937">"however, our current liberal democracies do not have their roots in ancient Athens,"</seg>
<seg id="938">"but in Magna Carta, in the glorious revolution of 1688, even in the American constitution."</seg>
<seg id="939">"while the Athenian democracy focused on free citizens and strengthening the working poor, our liberal democracy is based on the values of Magna Carta, which ultimately was a statute for rulers."</seg>
<seg id="940">"the liberal democracy came only when a complete separation of politics and economy was possible and the democratic process was restricted to politics, while the economy -- i.e. the world of corporations -- has become a democracy-free zone."</seg>
<seg id="941">"in today's democracies, there has been a relentless struggle between the two since the time when this separation of politics and economy began, by gradually undermining politics and escaping them."</seg>
<seg id="942">Do you wonder why politicians are no longer as they used to be?</seg>
<seg id="943">It is not a degeneration of their DNA.</seg>
<seg id="944">"it is because today it is possible to be in the government and still not in power, because the power has migrated from politics into the economy and the areas are separated."</seg>
<seg id="945">I mentioned my discord with capitalism.</seg>
<seg id="946">"if you think about it, it is about like a herd of predators who so sustainably decimated the animals from which they fed, decimated that at the end they starved."</seg>
<seg id="947">"similarly, it is with the economy that has so far cannibalised politics that it hurts itself through the self-created economic crisis itself. the power of the corporations is growing, political goods are invalidated, the inequality arises, the macroeconomic demand falls and the managing directors of corporations are too scared to invest in the cash of their companies."</seg>
<seg id="948">"the more successful capitalism drives the" democrats "out of democracy, the higher the twin summits, and the greater the waste of human labour power and the prosperity of mankind."</seg>
<seg id="949">"if this is true, it is obvious that we have to bring together politics and the economy, and it would be better if the" demos "control the control, as in ancient Athens, apart from the exclusion of slaves, women and foreigners."</seg>
<seg id="950">"by the way, this is not a new idea."</seg>
<seg id="951">The Marxist Left had this idea 100 years ago and it did not go very well.</seg>
<seg id="952">The lesson from the debacle of the Soviet Union should be that the working poor only regain a position as in ancient Athens without creating new kinds of brutality and extravagance.</seg>
<seg id="953">But there is a solution: abolish the working poor!</seg>
<seg id="954">Capitalism does it by replacing low-wage workers with automation and robots.</seg>
<seg id="955">"the problem is, as long as economy and politics are separate areas, automation makes the twin summit higher, the waste habitable, and the social conflicts lower, as it is already very soon, as I believe -- in countries like China."</seg>
<seg id="956">"so we must reunite the economy and reunite the areas of economy and politics, and ensure that we are democratizing the re-unified area, otherwise we end up in an ill surveillance hyperautocracy, which makes the film" Matrix "like a documentary."</seg>
<seg id="957">"the question is, therefore, not whether capitalism will survive the technological achievements that it has produced --"</seg>
<seg id="958">"the more interesting question is whether capitalism is replaced by a dystopie, similar to the" matrix, "or something similar to society in" Star Trek, "in which machines are serving people and people indulge their energy into researching the universe, or to indulge in a high-tech version of the ancient Athenians" Agora. ""</seg>
<seg id="959">I think we can be optimistic.</seg>
<seg id="960">So what would it be like to have this "Star Trek" -like utopia instead of the "matrix" like Dystopie?</seg>
<seg id="961">"in practical implementation, I would like to give you some examples in brief."</seg>
<seg id="962">"in the area of companies, please introduce a capital market where you earn money while you work and in which your capital is followed by a job to the next, from a company to the next, and the company -- no matter where you are working -- is the property of those who are currently working in the company."</seg>
<seg id="963">Then all income comes from capital and revenue and the concept of wage labour is completely overtaken.</seg>
<seg id="964">"no distinction between those who belong to the company, but they do not work in it, and employees working there that the company does not belong to. no exchange of exchange between capital and labour, no big gaps between investment and savings, and ultimately no uplifting twin-tops."</seg>
<seg id="965">"in the field of global political economy: please briefly imagine that our national currencies would have a free fluctuating exchange rate, in a universal, global, digital currency issued by the IMF [International Monetary Fund], and the G-20 [Group of the 20 largest emerging countries], in the interest of all humanity."</seg>
<seg id="966">"imagine that the whole world trade is traded in this currency -- we call it" the Cosmos, "in units of" Cosmos "-- and every government pays the sum corresponding to the trade deficit or the trade surplus of each country into a common fund."</seg>
<seg id="967">"imagine that this fund is investing in" green "technologies, especially in parts of the world where investment funds are rar."</seg>
<seg id="968">This is not a new idea.</seg>
<seg id="969">It is basically what John Maynard Keynes proposed in the Bretton Woods Conference from 1944.</seg>
<seg id="970">The problem was that at that time it was not the technical means to implement it.</seg>
<seg id="971">"today we have them, especially against the background of a reunified politics and economy."</seg>
<seg id="972">"the world I describe to you is also liberally, in which it favours privileged people, and Marxian because it will have buried the separation of capital and labour in the garbage dump of history, and Keynesian, global Keynesian."</seg>
<seg id="973">But above all else it is a world in which we can imagine a true democracy.</seg>
<seg id="974">Will we wake up in such a world</seg>
<seg id="975">Or will we sink into a "matrix" - similar dystopia?</seg>
<seg id="976">The answer depends on how we decide together politically.</seg>
<seg id="977">"it is in our hands, and we do it better democratically."</seg>
<seg id="978">Thank you.</seg>
<seg id="979">Bruno Giussani: Yanis...</seg>
<seg id="980">You describe yourself as libertarian Marxists in your biography.</seg>
<seg id="981">How relevant is Marx's analysis today?</seg>
<seg id="982">"Yanis Varoufakis: if anything of what I have just said is relevant, then Marx is relevant."</seg>
<seg id="983">"the reason for the reunification of politics and economy is... Do we not do this, technological development will generate such a massive decline in aggregate demand, which Larry Summers call" long-term stagnation. ""</seg>
<seg id="984">"by transferring this crisis from one part of the world to the next, as we are currently experiencing, it will not only destabilize our democracies but also the countries whose interest in liberal democracy is low."</seg>
<seg id="985">"if this analysis is correct, then Marx is quite relevant,"</seg>
<seg id="986">"like Hayek, that is why I am a liberal Marxist, and as Keynes, and therefore I am totally confused."</seg>
<seg id="987">"BG: in fact, and now we are well."</seg>
<seg id="988">"YV: if you don't work, you don't think enough."</seg>
<seg id="989">"BG: this is a very Greek, a kind of philosophical explanation -- YV: actually it was Einstein who said this. BG: in your lecture, you mentioned Singapore and China and yesterday at the dinner of the speakers you have said very clearly what you think of the West's view of China."</seg>
<seg id="990">Would you like to repeat it here?</seg>
<seg id="991">YV: there is a great deal of hypocrisy.</seg>
<seg id="992">In our liberal democracies we have the appearance of democracy.</seg>
<seg id="993">"as I said in my lecture, we have limited democracy to politics, while the area where most of it plays, the area of economy -- is a completely democratic zone."</seg>
<seg id="994">"in a sense, if I dare to say so provocatively, China is similar to the England of the 19th century."</seg>
<seg id="995">"for -- remember -- we tend to combine liberalism with democracy -- that is a mistake, historically considered."</seg>
<seg id="996">"liberalism, liberals, like John Stuart Mill --"</seg>
<seg id="997">He was particularly sceptical about the democratic development.</seg>
<seg id="998">"what one can observe in China now resembles very much the development we had in England during the industrial revolution, particularly the transition from the first to the second."</seg>
<seg id="999">"to submit to China now to do what the West has done in the 19th century itself, smells tremendously to hypocrisy."</seg>
<seg id="1000">BG: I am sure that many listeners are curious about their experiences as Greece's finance ministers at the beginning of the year.</seg>
<seg id="1001">YV: I suspected this was coming.</seg>
<seg id="1002">BG: yes...</seg>
<seg id="1003">How do you look back six months later to the first half of the year?</seg>
<seg id="1004">"YV: very exciting, from a personal point of view, and very disappointing because we had the opportunity to start a new beginning with the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1005">"not only Greece, but the eurozone,"</seg>
<seg id="1006">"to say goodbye to complacency, and the constant denial that a massive dumping line went through the eurozone and continues, which massively threatens the development of the whole European Union."</seg>
<seg id="1007">"we had the opportunity, based on the Greek proposal -- by the way, the first proposal that revealed this denial --"</seg>
<seg id="1008">"unfortunately, the powers within the eurozone, within the European group, still chose the denial."</seg>
<seg id="1009">But you know what is coming.</seg>
<seg id="1010">This is the experience from the Soviet Union --</seg>
<seg id="1011">"if you try to maintain an economic system that is not viable, through political will and authoritarianism, you might be able to delay it for a while, but when the changes occur, it happens abruptly and destructive."</seg>
<seg id="1012">BG: what changes do you foresee?</seg>
<seg id="1013">"YV: there is no doubt that the eurozone has no future, if we do not change its structure."</seg>
<seg id="1014">BG: did you make any mistakes in your time as Minister of Finance?</seg>
<seg id="1015">YV: every day.</seg>
<seg id="1016">BG: for example? YV: everyone who looks back -- Seriously...</seg>
<seg id="1017">"if there is a finance minister or any minister who after 6 months in office, especially in such a tense situation, claims he has made no mistake, then it is a dangerous person."</seg>
<seg id="1018">Of course I made mistakes.</seg>
<seg id="1019">The biggest mistake was to sign the application for extension of the debt programme at the end of February.</seg>
<seg id="1020">I believed that there was an honest interest in the lenders of the lenders to find a common solution.</seg>
<seg id="1021">But there was no such thing.</seg>
<seg id="1022">"they merely wanted to bring our government down, just because they did not want to deal with the distortions passed through the eurozone."</seg>
<seg id="1023">They did not want to admit that they have been a catastrophic program in Greece for 5 years.</seg>
<seg id="1024">We lost one third of our nominal GDP.</seg>
<seg id="1025">There is worse than during the "Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="1026">"none of the troika's troika's troika, who imposed this policy on us, confessed:" this was a colossal mistake. "</seg>
<seg id="1027">"BG: despite all this, and despite the aggressive actions of the talks, you seem to be quite pro-European."</seg>
<seg id="1028">YV: absolutely.</seg>
<seg id="1029">"" "my criticism of the European Union and the Eurozone has come from someone who lives and loves Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1030">My greatest fear is that the euro zone will not survive.</seg>
<seg id="1031">"for if they do not survive, the released centrifugal forces will be demonic and destroy the European Union."</seg>

<seg id="1038">"most of them have never heard of Roy Price, although he is probably responsible for twenty-eight minutes of your life on 19th April 2013."</seg>
<seg id="1039">Probably also for 22 very entertaining minutes but not for very many of you.</seg>
<seg id="1040">This goes back to the decision that Roy had met three years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1041">Roy Price is a senior employee at Amazon Studios.</seg>
<seg id="1042">The TV production company from Amazon.</seg>
<seg id="1043">"he is 47 years old, slim, has an icon and describes herself on Twitter as" Movies, TV, Technique, Tacos. ""</seg>
<seg id="1044">Roy has a very important job because he is responsible for looking out the shows and the content that Amazon will produce.</seg>
<seg id="1045">"of course, this is a very hard-fought industry."</seg>
<seg id="1046">There are so many TV shows that Roy can not choose any.</seg>
<seg id="1047">"he has to find shows that are very, very good."</seg>
<seg id="1048">"in other words, he has to find shows that are on the right side of this curve."</seg>
<seg id="1049">This curve is the review distribution of over 2500 TV series on the IMDB website. the rating goes from 1 to 10 and the amount shows how many shows this review will receive.</seg>
<seg id="1050">"if your show is rated with nine and higher, this is a winner."</seg>
<seg id="1051">Then you have a successful show.</seg>
<seg id="1052">"these are shows like" Breaking Bad, "" Game of Thrones, "" The Wire "-- all the shows that are addicting where, after looking at a season, your brain asks:" where are there more of these episodes? "</seg>
<seg id="1053">This kind of show.</seg>
<seg id="1054">"on the left, here at this end, shows like" Toddlers and Tiaras "-- -- this should tell you enough what is going on at this end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1055">"Roy Price does not worry about getting to the left side of the curve, because I think one needs special intelligence to offer" "Toddlers and Tiaras". ""</seg>
<seg id="1056">"he gets more thoughts about the medium output, the average television -- shows that are neither good nor bad, they simply don't excite."</seg>
<seg id="1057">So he must make sure that he is really on the right side.</seg>
<seg id="1058">"the pressure is present, and of course it is the first time Amazon makes something like that, so Roy Price doesn't want to risk anything."</seg>
<seg id="1059">He wants to create success.</seg>
<seg id="1060">"he needs guaranteed success, so he stops a competition."</seg>
<seg id="1061">"he takes many ideas for TV shows and chooses by an evaluation eight candidates for TV shows, then he produces the first episode of each of these shows and places them online, where they can watch for free."</seg>
<seg id="1062">"and when Amazon comes out for nothing, is it going to attack, right?"</seg>
<seg id="1063">Millions of spectators watch these episodes.</seg>
<seg id="1064">"however, they do not know that they are observed when watching these shows."</seg>
<seg id="1065">They are watched by Roy and his team who record everything.</seg>
<seg id="1066">"you capture when you start the show, when you pause, which parts you jump over or look again."</seg>
<seg id="1067">You collect millions of data to decide which show you should produce.</seg>
<seg id="1068">"in fact, they collect the data, process them and this results in the answer, and this is:" Amazon should make a sitcom over four republican US senators. "</seg>
<seg id="1069">They made this show.</seg>
<seg id="1070">Does anybody know the name of this show?</seg>
<seg id="1071">"yes," Alpha House, "but it seems that not many can remember this show because it wasn't that good."</seg>
<seg id="1072">"it's just an average show -- in the truest sense of the word -- because the average of this curve is 7.4 and Alpha House lands around 7.5 -- meaning something above average, but not exactly what Roy and his team worked."</seg>
<seg id="1073">"about the same time with another company another manager has placed a top show through data analysis. his name is Ted, Ted Sarandos, the manager for programming of Netflix. just like Roy he is always looking to find this a super show and he also uses data for it, but he makes it a bit different."</seg>
<seg id="1074">"instead of hosting a contest, he and his team looked at the available data on the Netflix viewer, so the reviews they give the shows their course, what shows they like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="1075">"then they use this data to find out these little details about the audience: what shows they like, which producers, which actors."</seg>
<seg id="1076">"when they had all the parts together, they took a venture and decided not to make a sitcom over four Senators, but a drama series about a Senator."</seg>
<seg id="1077">Do you know this show?</seg>
<seg id="1078">"yes," House of Cards. "Netflix has landed a hit, at least for the first two seasons."</seg>
<seg id="1079">House of Cards "gets a 9.1 rating on this curve. so exactly where they wanted to go.</seg>
<seg id="1080">"of course, the question is: what has happened here?"</seg>
<seg id="1081">"one has two very competitive, data sealed companies."</seg>
<seg id="1082">"they combine these many data with each other and it works great for one of them, but not for the other company."</seg>
<seg id="1083">What is that?</seg>
<seg id="1084">Because logic says somehow that it should work with everything.</seg>
<seg id="1085">"if you collect millions of data, for a decision you make, you should make a good decision."</seg>
<seg id="1086">You have 200 years of statistics as a back-up.</seg>
<seg id="1087">It is optimized by very powerful computers.</seg>
<seg id="1088">"the least thing you can expect is good TV, isn't it?"</seg>
<seg id="1089">"if data analysis does not work this way, then this is a bit frightening, because we live in a time in which we have more and more statistics to make serious decisions, far beyond television."</seg>
<seg id="1090">Does anyone know the Multi-Health System here?</seg>
<seg id="1091">"nobody. OK, that's even good."</seg>
<seg id="1092">"multi-Health Systems is a software company and I hope that no one in this room ever comes into contact with this software. if you come into contact, you are in prison."</seg>
<seg id="1093">"if someone is in jail here in the US and ask for discharge, it is likely that the data analysis of this company is used to determine whether a discharge occurs or not."</seg>
<seg id="1094">"just like Amazon and Netflix. but instead of deciding whether a show will be good or bad, it will be decided whether a person will be good or bad."</seg>
<seg id="1095">"moderate television, 22 minutes, this can be really bad, but even more years in prison are worse."</seg>
<seg id="1096">"unfortunately, there is evidence that this data analysis, despite the many data,"</seg>
<seg id="1097">Not always produce the best results. this is not because a company like Multi-Health Systems does not know how to use data.</seg>
<seg id="1098">The data of experienced companies are also wrong.</seg>
<seg id="1099">"yes, even Google sometimes makes mistakes."</seg>
<seg id="1100">"in 2009, Google announced that they can predict outbreaks of flu, the worst kind, by data analysis of Google searches."</seg>
<seg id="1101">It worked wonderfully and was a great news sensation. success culminated in a publication in the magazine "Nature."</seg>
<seg id="1102">"it worked perfectly, year by year, until it suddenly stopped working,"</seg>
<seg id="1103">And no one could say why.</seg>
<seg id="1104">"it simply did not work, this was once again a sensation, including the revocation of publication in the magazine" Nature. ""</seg>
<seg id="1105">Even the data of experienced companies such as Amazon and Google sometimes misunderstand something.</seg>
<seg id="1106">"despite all these mistakes, data flow increasingly into decisions of life -- at the workplace, in the enforcement of law, in medicine."</seg>
<seg id="1107">So we should make sure that data is helpful.</seg>
<seg id="1108">"I also know many difficulties with data. I work in computer-aided genetics, an area where some very wise people use vast amounts of data to make serious decisions, such as deciding on a cancer therapy."</seg>
<seg id="1109">Or the development of a medication. over the years I have recognized some patterns about the difference between successful decisions based on data and not successful decisions. this pattern should be spread.</seg>
<seg id="1110">"you need to solve a complex problem, mainly two things:"</seg>
<seg id="1111">"first, disassemble this problem into its individual parts so that you can analyse individual parts; as a second you put the individual parts together in order to make a decision."</seg>
<seg id="1112">"sometimes you have to do this several times, but there are always two things: take apart and put together again."</seg>
<seg id="1113">And now the most important thing: data and data analysis are just good for the first part.</seg>
<seg id="1114">"data and data analysis, no matter how powerful, can only help to disassemble a problem and understand its parts."</seg>
<seg id="1115">They are not suitable to assemble the parts and then come to a conclusion.</seg>
<seg id="1116">There is another tool for this and we all own it: our brain.</seg>
<seg id="1117">"if there is something in which the brain is good, it is necessary to assemble parts and pieces again, even if the information is incomplete, in order to make a good decision -- especially when it is the brain of an expert."</seg>
<seg id="1118">"that's why I think Netflix was so successful because they used data and minds, where they also belong in the process."</seg>
<seg id="1119">"they use data to better understand their audience, which they would otherwise have not been able to do. but the decision on how to take all these parts together and make a show like" House of Cards, "was not in the data."</seg>
<seg id="1120">Ted Sarandos and his team met this decision for this show which meant that they had a great personal risk with that decision.</seg>
<seg id="1121">Amazon however did this in the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id="1122">"they used data to control all their decisions first when they were competing for TV ideas, then selecting" Alpha House "as a show."</seg>
<seg id="1123">It was a safe decision because they were always able to say: "they tell us the data."</seg>
<seg id="1124">It did not lead to the desired result.</seg>
<seg id="1125">"data is helpful for better decisions, but I think things go wrong when data start to control our decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1126">"no matter how powerful they are, data are just one tool, and to not forget that, this device is quite useful."</seg>
<seg id="1127">Many of you will...</seg>
<seg id="1128">"before there was data, this was the device for decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1129">Many know it.</seg>
<seg id="1130">"it's also called" "Magic 8 Ball". "it's amazing. for decisions using a yes or no question, you just need to shake the ball to get an answer." highly probable "-- exactly here at this moment."</seg>
<seg id="1131">I will fight it out later with a technique demo.</seg>
<seg id="1132">"I have made some decisions in my life so far, and I should have listened to the ball in hindsight."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"but, as you of course know, if you have the data available, you would like to replace it by something much more sophisticated, such as data analysis to make better decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1134">But this does not change the basic structure.</seg>
<seg id="1135">"in the end, it's up to us to make decisions if we want to achieve something extraordinary at the end of the right corner."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"and I feel this as very encouraging news that despite the large amount of data it is still paying off to make decisions, to be an expert in what you do, and take risks."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"at the end, it is not the data, but the risks with which you land at the right end of the curve."</seg>
<seg id="1138">Thank you very much.</seg>
