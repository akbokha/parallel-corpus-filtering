Munich 18@@ 56 : four cards that change your view of the city
an Ir@@ ren @-@ Anst@@ alt where young people should meet today .
a cryp@@ t which is now dug for the S @-@ Bahn tunnel .
farmers are cultiv@@ ating the former cause of farmers .
the oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .
it gets nervous when maps are not up @-@ to @-@ date .
everybody knows this because the car @-@ Nav@@ i showed a green meadow instead of a b@@ ypass road .
&quot; the historical maps of the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas , an offer of the Ge@@ op@@ ort@@ als Bavaria of the state government , are anything but current - but therefore very enligh@@ tening . &quot;
especially if you compare it to current online maps .
then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread @-@ area of Munich &apos;s Mer@@ cury have changed since the 19th century .
the digital Bayern @-@ Atlas is a pat@@ ch@@ work that you can &apos;t recognize as such .
&quot; for cities and municipalities , detailed maps , so @-@ called &quot; &quot; original sheets &quot; &quot; were incorporated into the large overview map . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bavarian Palace Department , these were created between 18@@ 10 and 18@@ 64 and the first measurement of Bavaria &apos;s first survey . &quot;
your Princip@@ al : Napoleon .
&quot; the French army leader , Bavaria , occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria . &quot;
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a top@@ ographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .
&quot; even if the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lun@@ é@@ ville from February 9 , 18@@ 01 : it was today &apos;s neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern @-@ map . &quot;
&quot; Elec@@ tor Max IV Joseph further promoted the project , founded the &quot; Top@@ ographic Bureau &quot; - and thus the Bavarian Palace Department . &quot;
the data sheet for Munich dates from the year 18@@ 56 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .
the comparison of early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital .
the city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .
&quot; one example is the for@@ ti@@ ling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 18@@ 56 . &quot;
&quot; Send@@ ling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created , i.e. in 18@@ 77 , as a Munich subur@@ b . &quot;
today it &apos;s located in the middle of the city .
&quot; the houses of Unter@@ send@@ lings are concentrated around 18@@ 56 along the today &apos;s Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser@@ strasse , which was named after George Sebastian Pl@@ ing@@ an@@ ser in 18@@ 78 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 17@@ 05 . &quot;
&quot; where today is the West@@ park , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : when zo@@ oming in , a small @-@ scale card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand@@ writing numbered fl@@ ur@@ pieces from the so @-@ called &quot; &quot; urine &quot; &quot; from which the basic tax was derived . &quot;
&quot; small par@@ c@@ els there are no more farmers there today , but farmers in the plant &quot; Land in Sun . &quot; &quot;
a large green area is located north of Unter@@ send@@ ling .
&quot; Ther@@ esi@@ en@@ wi@@ ese , the location of the Oktober@@ fest since 18@@ 10 , was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert . &quot;
&quot; on the other side of the Is@@ ar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiat@@ ric medicine . &quot;
&quot; in the area of today &apos;s district Au @-@ Hai@@ d@@ hausen , one reads not only the street name &quot; &quot; at Gast@@ ei@@ g &quot; &quot; or from the hill &quot; &quot; On the Venti@@ lation &quot; &quot; - but also in large letters &quot; &quot; Ir@@ ren Anst@@ alt &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; yes , here at the Au@@ er@@ feld@@ straße you once closed people with del@@ u@@ sions . &quot;
&quot; in 18@@ 58 / 59 there was the Munich district asylum &quot; &quot; Auf der auber@@ ge Lü@@ ften &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; from 18@@ 72 , Dr. Bernhard von Gu@@ dden led the institution - the psychiat@@ rist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II . &quot;
&quot; he was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the accus@@ ation of so @-@ called Ir@@ ren . &quot;
&quot; in addition , he has forbidden the personnel to apply force against the occup@@ ants , &quot; &quot; says Hermann Wilhelm , head of the Museum Hai@@ d@@ hausen , who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution . &quot;
&quot; for 280 patients it was first place , later extended to 500 places . &quot;
&quot; at some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chal@@ k ren@@ al in Haar in 1905 . &quot;
&quot; the Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost ( Is@@ ar @-@ Amp@@ er @-@ Klin@@ ik@@ um Munich @-@ Ost ) , one of Germany &apos;s largest psychiat@@ ri@@ sts since 2006 . &quot;
young people in the Munich @-@ based Sal@@ esi@@ an@@ um meet now on the grounds of the former prison institution .
the Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities .
&quot; west is the football field of the TS@@ V Munich East , east of residential buildings from the 1980s . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the children &apos;s house &quot; Casa Don Bos@@ co &quot; was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the Ir@@ ren@@ zia , which was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing ra@@ ids . &quot;
&quot; the Mari@@ en@@ platz was registered in 18@@ 56 as the &quot; Main Place , &quot; the Kauf@@ inger@@ straße was called &quot; Kauf@@ inger G@@ asse . &quot; &quot;
the Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .
&quot; in December 1944 , the Al@@ lies bom@@ bed many holes in the inner city . &quot;
a big remained until today - at Mari@@ enhof .
&quot; the English Institute , small business houses and a cryp@@ t from the Middle Ages were once occupied by Mari@@ enhof , where these days will take place and on 5 April 2017 the ground @-@ breaking ceremony for the second S @-@ Bahn stem route takes place . &quot;
with the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Mari@@ enhof .
civil Rights Committee releases a travel warning for Mis@@ sour@@ i
the National Federation for the Promotion of Far@@ ms has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Mis@@ sour@@ i based on discrimin@@ atory policies and rac@@ ist attacks .
&quot; the NA@@ AC@@ P Travel Advisory for the state of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for special attention to af@@ ro @-@ American travelers , visitors and Mis@@ sour@@ i , as a number of question@@ able , race @-@ based occur@@ ren@@ ces occur throughout the state and will be noted here , &quot; &quot; says the group &apos;s opinion . &quot;
&quot; a recently adopted law of Mis@@ sour@@ i , which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination , as well as the state prosec@@ uting authorities that dispro@@ portion@@ ately target minorities , initiated the group to issue the travel warning , said the NA@@ AC@@ P . &quot;
they have violations of civil rights that happen to people .
&quot; they are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , &quot; said the president of the Mis@@ sour@@ i NA@@ AC@@ P , R@@ od Chapel , the K@@ ans@@ as City Star . &quot;
we hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven &apos;t heard yet .
it is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States .
&quot; the group cited incidents such as rac@@ ist off@@ ences against black students at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i and the death of T@@ ory S@@ anders , 28 , a black man from Tenn@@ es@@ see . &quot;
S@@ anders died under question@@ able circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more petrol during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Mis@@ sour@@ i police without being accused of a crime .
&quot; the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Mis@@ sour@@ i General Public Prosecutor , which shows that black mot@@ orists in the state are 75 percent more frequent than white . &quot;
&quot; the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Mis@@ sour@@ i , &quot; Chapel . &quot;
&quot; people need to be willing , whether to bring ch@@ ewing money or to let relatives know that they travel through the state . &quot;
&quot; Mis@@ sour@@ i recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the hate crime programme of the FBI , which classi@@ fies the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country . &quot;
&quot; the warning is also an answer to a new Mis@@ sour@@ i law , which would make it harder to acc@@ use a company for housing or employment discrimination . &quot;
&quot; previously , the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union ( AC@@ L@@ U ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states committed immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for migration violations , leading to further racial profil@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently , interest groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States . &quot;
the electric fence project is elementary
the Fischer@@ bach Wei@@ de@@ j@@ n project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .
the CD@@ U federal deputy Peter Weiss and K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac obtained a picture on the spot .
representatives of the Fisch@@ bacher CD@@ U @-@ town association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two de@@ pu@@ ties met at the court of the Schwen@@ de@@ mann family .
&quot; Markus Schwen@@ de@@ mann initially provided insights into his farm , where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals cared for and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests . &quot;
&quot; for him , the &quot; Black Forest &quot; is the alternative route for the milk of its cows , such as Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
only region@@ ales arrive at the table of the holiday guests .
&quot; as he is also BL@@ H@@ V chairman of Fischer@@ bach , he described the electric fence project as &quot; &quot; essential . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I cannot profit@@ ably farm on such steep areas .
&quot; the grass@@ land area care for a lot of work , much must be processed with the br@@ ush@@ cutter . &quot;
&quot; we have to fight with the conditions and top@@ ography here , &quot; &quot; said Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , he took over the par@@ ental farm and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and ferti@@ liz@@ ers , even if it did not lead a bio @-@ business . &quot;
&quot; for mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : &quot; the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader @-@ promotion . &quot;
&quot; at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hect@@ are , farmers would have to be supported . &quot;
it is hoped that the re@@ for@@ estation of the land could be drawn out for quite a while .
&quot; the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to carry on their business , &quot; &quot; stressed the mayor . &quot;
the farmers are often critic@@ ised for the promotion
&quot; in 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced . &quot;
&quot; the area of disclosure is therefore 40 hectares , which may not be for@@ ested until at least 20@@ 23 . &quot;
&quot; of the total cost of 71 500 euros , half of the leaders were promoted , one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fisch@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; thus the farmers remained 12 6@@ 10 euros , which they had to invest in 16,@@ 2 kilometres of soft @-@ fence . &quot;
&quot; the great advantage is the lon@@ ge@@ vity of the f@@ ences , &quot; declared Schwen@@ de@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; K@@ ord@@ ula K@@ ov@@ ac stressed : &quot; &quot; you do a really good job , without farmers and house@@ wives , it doesn &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; also for Peter Weiss , it was clear that &quot; &quot; the best food is produced here . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Land@@ scape Conservation Line ( L@@ PR ) Baden @-@ Württemberg enables the state convey@@ ance of pasture @-@ f@@ ences .
the goal is to open the Black Forest .
the condition is the presence of a con@@ ve@@ yer marked by the L@@ PR .
&quot; in addition , the enclosed area may not be slu@@ gg@@ ish @-@ efficient ( inclin@@ ation of more than 35 percent ) and must therefore be threatened by re@@ for@@ estation . &quot;
&quot; for the Fis@@ her@@ men &apos;s soft @-@ launch project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 par@@ c@@ els is currently underway , which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence . &quot;
&quot; the area of disclosure corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros . &quot;
is nothing more sacred ?
now the White House of Tru@@ mp is taking the Statue of Liberty
the saf@@ est sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .
the Americans regard these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Fir@@ dos Platz in Bag@@ h@@ dad in 2003 .
&quot; Stephen Miller , one of the key ide@@ ologists of the Tru@@ mp regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic ax@@ e in a heated dispute with Jim A@@ co@@ sta from CN@@ N on the pro@@ positions of the president for dr@@ astic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty . &quot;
&quot; to stay fair , Miller did not handle the statue itself . &quot;
a hor@@ de of boat owners and Liberty I@@ mit@@ es would have liked him if he had done so .
&quot; but he resor@@ ted to its significance , and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after completion of the monument , was added to his base . &quot;
&quot; as Miller A@@ co@@ sta , &quot; I don &apos;t want to enter a complete thing about history here , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that illumin@@ ates the world . &quot;
the poem you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty .
&quot; Miller is fac@@ tu@@ ally correct , but as he formulated it himself , it is not really about history . &quot;
&quot; it is about the contemporary response to the start@@ ling words of Lazarus , the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants , but the poor@@ est of the poor : &quot; your we@@ ary , your poor , and your oppressed masses who long for free breathing , / the el@@ ating garbage of your rich coasts . &quot;
there was never a time when the &quot; mis@@ erable garbage &quot; was better to be seen on our screens .
Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Tru@@ mp USA .
this conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .
&quot; Lazarus - and her friends , who decided to place their words on the basis of their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action . &quot;
the sculpture should show the connections between French and American re@@ public@@ anism by presenting the female em@@ bodi@@ ment of freedom in a worn @-@ out classical illustration .
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .
and she gives herself a very different name : mother of the ex@@ iles .
the link between poem and image is a brilliant feminist cou@@ p and a devastating attack on American N@@ ati@@ vis@@ m .
&quot; and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time . &quot;
&quot; Grand Schrei@@ er R@@ ush Lim@@ bau@@ gh , a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Tru@@ mp , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty calls no one , but rather an early neo@@ conservative , who brings the American flame to the surrounding world : &quot; Lady Liberty continues . &quot;
it should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .
the torch should not enligh@@ ten the way to the United States . &quot;
&quot; quite unusual , Lim@@ bau@@ gh has come across something here . &quot;
the importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception .
&quot; the great imagin@@ ative action of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , mis@@ erable , but hop@@ eful people after long and often terrible journeys on the de@@ cks of ships . &quot;
&quot; in the true sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives . &quot;
her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear .
&quot; and , of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Tru@@ mp would ever want to recognize . &quot;
&quot; their torch should not illum@@ ine the path , but ign@@ ite the hatred that is their only source of power . &quot;
world Championships 2017 : N@@ eil Black pra@@ ises Scottish Members of the Great Britain
E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle re@@ members a time when only two Sc@@ ots belonged to the UK team .
&quot; the executive director of the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom , N@@ eil Black , says that the 16 @-@ member Scottish cont@@ ingent in the World Championship will make a massive contribution to the team . &quot;
a record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which will start on Friday .
&quot; black believes that &quot; &quot; something special developed in Scotland &quot; &quot; and the athle@@ tics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it . &quot;
&quot; we welcome it , and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it , &quot; Black said . &quot;
I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done .
the Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .
British Ath@@ le@@ tics : it has something to do with what they have done .
and also with the type on the street corner .
&quot; whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . &quot;
&quot; several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates , including Laura Mu@@ ir and Andrew But@@ flip - who will compete against Sir Mo Far@@ ah on the 5,000 m track , while E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Do@@ yle was elected by the team to captain . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; E@@ ili@@ d@@ h is rather modest . &quot;
&quot; her captain &apos;s speech was incredible , &quot; &quot; says Black . &quot;
&quot; a number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motiv@@ ating . &quot;
&quot; the passion and the real feeling , which E@@ ili@@ d@@ h did quite naturally , were great . &quot;
&quot; the Com@@ mon@@ wealth silver medal winner , who will compete in their fifth world champi@@ onships at the 400 m hur@@ d@@ les , says that it is &quot; incredible &quot; that 16 Schot@@ ten are in the British team . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven , which were reached in 1983 and 2015 . &quot;
the middle @-@ distance runner Mu@@ ir leads on this road and has set up five British and two European records last year .
&quot; it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs . &quot;
&quot; Chris O &apos;@@ H@@ are , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot@@ sman to watch the victory of the British Team Tri@@ als and the Anni@@ versary games . &quot;
Do@@ yle remembered her first world champi@@ onships as the only other Scot@@ sman in the team Lee Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell .
&quot; the team captain says she is &quot; &quot; enormously proud &quot; &quot; of the fact that many of her country@@ men are not only part of the team , but in some cases they will also be involved with the medals and the fin@@ als . &quot;
&quot; the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but knowing that my te@@ amm@@ ers voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me , &quot; she added . &quot;
obviously I am very proud of all the Sc@@ ots that belong to the team .
it only shows how far we have come .
&quot; and they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb on platforms . &quot;
as for my speech as a captain ?
&quot; yes , I think she went well . &quot;
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship .
so it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin .
I get a second chance to go out and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there .
blocking of critics about Facebook : don &apos;t worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the embarrass@@ ment of voters
the father of our country knew something of a bad press .
&quot; the Americans loved George Washington , but it didn &apos;t take long for the newspapers to beat him because of everything from domestic politics to its political principles . &quot;
&quot; he p@@ opped in criticism , sure . &quot;
but he did not silence his critics .
&quot; in 17@@ 83 , Washington said : &quot; &quot; freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dum@@ b , we are led like sheep to slaughter . &quot;
this brings me to Mary@@ land to Gover@@ nor Lar@@ ry Ho@@ gan who has to work on being more like Washington .
Ho@@ gan &apos;s employees have blocked and er@@ ased the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .
and the American Civil Liber@@ ties Union su@@ ed him at the beginning of this week .
&quot; the governor &apos;s staff dismissed the suit as fri@@ vol@@ ous , and the online comment was full of a counter @-@ reaction with &quot; Na , and ? . &quot; &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s just Facebook , &quot; many people said . &quot;
but it is important .
and it is particularly important if it is a type such as Ho@@ gan .
this is a republi@@ can governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amaz@@ ingly popular .
he has the second highest consent of the 50 govern@@ ors of the nation .
Ho@@ gan is not a reactionary heat @-@ head .
he has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adher@@ ence to the principles .
he was also very clever@@ ly in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hair @-@ less head after chemotherapy on his side .
&quot; therefore , the blocking of persons coming to the Gover@@ nor &apos;s side is a public forum that is considered to be officially designated and by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous . &quot;
&quot; in an interview with The Washington Post , Ho@@ gan spokes@@ woman Am@@ elia Ch@@ asse defended the governor &apos;s actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moder@@ ation . &quot;
but it is too easy to use the image of troll@@ s or sp@@ amm@@ ers or hat@@ eful people that vibr@@ ate online the whi@@ p .
the post spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by Ho@@ gan .
&quot; and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; they all said that their comments were respect@@ ful , thou@@ ghtful and not prof@@ ane . &quot;
the pastor prayed the Bible in his post and appe@@ aled to Ho@@ gan Catholic faith .
&quot; lawyer Lak@@ sh@@ mi Sar@@ ma Ram@@ ani of Bo@@ wie , M@@ d . , was not bot@@ tled , but she asked for hate crimes . &quot;
&quot; I pol@@ itely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , &quot; she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast &quot; The Post . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I do not like this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then they are dis@@ regarded by some rather as a so @-@ called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens . &quot;
&quot; what the governor &apos;s staff called &quot; concentrated spam &quot; attack would probably call others &quot; &quot; interc@@ ession &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment .
&quot; it is much cleaner than in earlier times , if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical items or to arrest demonstr@@ ators and silence them . &quot;
but that exactly happens digit@@ ally .
Ho@@ gan is not the first public official who critic@@ ises Facebook and other social media .
President Tru@@ mp is su@@ ed by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .
one of the first mil@@ estones in this question fell last week in Virginia .
&quot; the Chairman of the Board of Super@@ vis@@ ors of the Lou@@ dou@@ n County passed the First A@@ mend@@ ment , according to US District Ju@@ dge James C. C@@ ach@@ er@@ is in Alexandria , when they ban@@ ished a vot@@ er from their Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; and in K@@ entu@@ cky , Gover@@ nor Matt Bev@@ in ( R ) also received a visit from the AC@@ L@@ U for his use of Facebook and Twitter . &quot;
it should not be so difficult .
&quot; at the time of Washington , the time of affordable porting had a similar effect as the Internet . &quot;
&quot; the number of newspapers was multiplied between 17@@ 76 and 1800 , and anonymous correspondence hits his lead . &quot;
&quot; and even then , Washington had anonymous troll@@ s . &quot;
&quot; the people who used pseu@@ don@@ y@@ ms like &quot; Jur@@ ic@@ ola , &quot; &quot; Val@@ eri@@ us , &quot; &quot; Bel@@ is@@ arius &quot; and &quot; Por@@ tius , &quot; wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington &apos;s decisions . &quot;
&quot; peti@@ tions who critici@@ zed his position on the treaty of Am@@ ity , trade and shipping with Great Britain overwhel@@ med his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project . &quot;
but he has not put them into silence .
&quot; freedom of speech , dis@@ agreement and dis@@ courses are the basis of our nation . &quot;
and true guidance means to accept that .
Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club
&quot; the former European No. 1 Ron@@ an Raff@@ er@@ ty will be hoping for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance club in East Lot@@ hi@@ an hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open . &quot;
&quot; the Nor@@ di@@ re , who last year led the Arch@@ er@@ field to the final round , before he lost Paul E@@ ales , is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CE@@ Os Jer@@ ry Sar@@ v@@ adi . &quot;
&quot; I saw how the Renaissance club was built , and we see how he achieved his fame with this event , &quot; &quot; said Raff@@ er@@ ty . &quot;
&quot; players will see this course from its best side , it &apos;s in a great condition . &quot;
Jer@@ ry made a great job when he fixed this place .
he is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .
this is a great showcase for this course . &quot;
&quot; the Engl@@ ish@@ man E@@ ales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , although in his 32 @-@ year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour . &quot;
&quot; that feels really special , &quot; said the player based in South@@ port . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t defend the Extre@@ ma@@ dur@@ a Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them .
coming back to this part of the world is magical .
it is a wonderful place to play golf .
&quot; the memories of last year come back , and it was something special for me and my wife Shar@@ on to win last year here . &quot;
it was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate .
&quot; Gary Or@@ r , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50@@ th birthday this year , returns to the action on the home floor . &quot;
this event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aber@@ deen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .
&quot; it always means a bit more when playing at home , &quot; Or@@ r said , the man from Hel@@ ens@@ burgh . &quot;
&quot; you want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure . &quot;
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .
I am happy about how much has gone .
&quot; with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Wo@@ os@@ nam and Senior Major champion Paul Broad@@ hur@@ st , Roger Chap@@ man , Mark James and Mark Mc@@ N@@ one . &quot;
&quot; the former Ry@@ der Cup captain Sam Tor@@ ran@@ ce is among the six Sc@@ ots in the field , the others are Andrew Old@@ corn , Stephen Mc@@ Alli@@ ster , Bill Long@@ mu@@ ir and Ross Dru@@ m@@ mond . &quot;
&quot; admission is free , the car park costs £ 5 per car with an occup@@ ant and £ 10 per car with two or more passengers . &quot;
all proceeds go to Pro@@ state Cancer UK .
less pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer due to passive smoking
&quot; over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died due to pas@@ siv@@ ity of lung cancer . &quot;
scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg @-@ E@@ pp@@ endorf ( U@@ KE ) come to this conclusion in a study .
&quot; according to our estimates , 16@@ 7 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases are attributed to passive smoking per year , &quot; said Professor Hei@@ ko Becher . &quot;
&quot; as a comparison , he drew up his own study on this subject in 1994 . &quot;
&quot; at that time , there were still 400 pul@@ mon@@ ary cancer cases due to pas@@ siv@@ ity per year in Germany . &quot;
the new study is published in the &quot; International Journal of Public Health . &quot;
house connections prove to be very complex
&quot; the works in the Vill@@ inger Straße are in full swing and &quot; &quot; reasonably in time , &quot; &quot; said the director of the Bau@@ hof Fred Hein@@ ze . &quot;
&quot; in the area of the house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected as there is much hiding in the underground , which is not noted in the plans . &quot;
&quot; traffic , which again hin@@ ders the construction work , is a major problem for St@@ ump@@ p &apos;s building tru@@ pp . &quot;
&quot; the ignorance of drivers before red lights and shut@@ ters is already enormous , &quot; says Hein@@ ze . &quot;
the road is closed and only the regular buses are eligible for passage .
&quot; Angelo Car@@ us@@ o , Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z and Tim Ko@@ stor@@ z from St@@ ump@@ p have been working on the bridge for weeks . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; the hot days were very exhau@@ sting . &quot;
&quot; but luckily we were supplied by our friend Fritz Matt with cool mineral water , &quot; says Mar@@ vin Ko@@ stor@@ z . &quot;
poverty and Death in the Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land
&quot; when Bar@@ d@@ ina De@@ ge@@ i coo@@ ks dinner , she doesn &apos;t use a stove . &quot;
it even uses rarely a pot .
&quot; in her wooden house in En@@ cir@@ ali , the capital of the Pan@@ i@@ ai Reg@@ ent in the un@@ troubled Indon@@ esian province of Papua , house@@ wife usually speci@@ fies a sweet potato - locally called &quot; not@@ a &quot; - directly in the fireplace . &quot;
&quot; after half an hour the scar@@ let tu@@ ber with ze@@ al@@ ous , un@@ washed hands is removed and swal@@ lowed . &quot;
&quot; De@@ ge@@ i sits on the lo@@ am floor - she has no furniture - where she also performs her daily work , e.g. washing clothes with clou@@ dy water from the nearby sw@@ amp . &quot;
a bucket in an empty space serves as a lat@@ rine .
&quot; as youngest of the four wives of her husband , no fields were assigned to her . &quot;
poly@@ gam@@ y is common here .
&quot; of course , too late to work can be dangerous : most of the villa@@ gers are unemployed , and many drink heavily , and there are soldiers here . &quot;
&quot; nobody dar@@ es to run around in the village after 5@@ pm , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; it is a rare insight into the daily life in the high@@ lands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was recorded in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,@@ 0@@ 26 elders were to vote in front of the occupying troops . &quot;
&quot; an existing movement , which stir@@ red up the independence against the Dutch rule , quickly turned against the Jak@@ arta government , which has control over the region and exclu@@ des foreign journalists or legal observers from it . &quot;
&quot; in 2003 , the province was officially distributed in Papua and West Papua , where the independent part of Papua New Guinea became the eastern part of the island . &quot;
&quot; the journey includes a 90 @-@ minute flight from the provincial capital J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura to Nab@@ ire , and then a morning 5 @-@ hour drive with the car . &quot;
there is no public transport .
&quot; the town with some 19@@ ,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo @-@ f@@ ences , and of corrugated roofs , which were converted into different yel@@ low@@ ish tones by rust . &quot;
&quot; only very few Indon@@ esi@@ ans have made their journey here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners . &quot;
&quot; before Christian missionaries arrived , Me@@ e P@@ ago Pap@@ u@@ ans honored a god named U@@ ga Tam@@ ee . &quot;
there were other changes .
&quot; we were not used to wearing these clothes , &quot; says De@@ ge@@ i , pointing to her lively , hand @-@ woven tur@@ ban , her dark shirt and her light skirt . &quot;
&quot; in the past , we only had sheets on our bodies . &quot;
&quot; Papua is Indonesia &apos;s poor@@ est province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and liter@@ acy rates in Asia . &quot;
but it is also Indon@@ esian Gold@@ land .
&quot; the largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Gras@@ berg , owned by Free@@ port Mc@@ Mor@@ an from Phoenix , is located only 60 miles from Pan@@ i@@ ai , a high land province in the size of New Jersey with 15@@ 3,000 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 alone , Free@@ port has reduced the value of $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Papua has wood resources worth USD 78 billion . &quot;
&quot; these riches however , are a source of misery for Papua , ensuring that Indonesia &apos;s powerful military preserves a suff@@ oc@@ ating presence . &quot;
&quot; an investigation of 2005 in the New York Times reported that Free@@ port paid local military personnel and units of almost 20 million US dollars between 1998 and 2004 , including up to 150@@ ,000 US dollars to a single officer . &quot;
Pap@@ u@@ lian demands for greater autonomy thre@@ aten those golden g@@ ans and are treated mer@@ cil@@ essly .
&quot; according to activists , more than 500,000 Jews have been killed and thousands have been rap@@ ed , tortured and imprisoned by the Indon@@ esian military since 1969 . &quot;
mass kill@@ ings in Pap@@ u@@ as &apos;s tribal land in the 1970 @-@ s were made to commit genocide in accordance with the Asia Human Rights Commission .
&quot; in the region alone , the Indon@@ esian police arrested over 3,@@ 900 peaceful demonstr@@ ators last year alone . &quot;
&quot; we Wer@@ den Every@@ thing &quot; is stated in a report of the Bris@@ ban@@ e Arch@@ dioc@@ ese from 2016 , in which reports of atro@@ cities of the previous year are contained , such as illegal exec@@ utions and torture - rape and electric charges are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal suppression of peaceful demonstrations . &quot;
&quot; it is difficult to count the number of victims since every week incidents happen , &quot; says Andreas Har@@ son@@ o , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch . &quot;
the screws have increased since Pap@@ u@@ as resources bring a influ@@ x of sett@@ lers from other parts of Indonesia .
&quot; the population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing , as Muslim economic migrants come from the most popul@@ ous islands of Java , Bor@@ neo , Sum@@ atra and Sul@@ awes@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jav@@ an@@ ese war@@ den caf@@ et@@ erias sell fried chicken and G@@ ado @-@ G@@ ado , a mixed vegetables served with pe@@ an@@ ut sauce . &quot;
local people are fighting to keep up with this .
&quot; migrants have started selling chi@@ ckens and vegetables in the traditional market cheaper than local Papua , &quot; explains A@@ bet@@ h You , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old Pan@@ i@@ ai native who moved to the provincial capital of J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura . &quot;
it has cost the native Papua - the Mama @-@ Mama &#91; the women &#93; from Papua - their market .
&quot; the Indon@@ esian President Jok@@ o Wi@@ do@@ do , popul@@ arly known as Jok@@ ow@@ i , promised to address the ine@@ qualities and violations of law in Papua . &quot;
the former Zimmermann secured 27 out of 29 districts of Papua - including Pan@@ i@@ ai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jak@@ arta .
&quot; but in Papua , little has changed , and today the locals feel betra@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; our hearts are broken because we agreed to Jok@@ ow@@ i in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfill our hopes that justice will be restored , &quot; &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Pan@@ i@@ ai suffered a low point only two months after Jok@@ ow@@ is &apos;s inauguration in October . &quot;
&quot; on December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was outside and sang Christmas songs in front of a camp@@ fire in En@@ ligh@@ ali , when two Indon@@ esian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle . &quot;
the frigh@@ tened children told them that they should turn their head@@ lights on .
&quot; one of the soldiers took offen@@ se of their sound , and came back later with four soldiers , so the local pastor Y@@ av@@ ed@@ t T@@ eb@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; the soldiers who had drunk , hun@@ ted and struck the group with their rif@@ les , said victims and witnesses . &quot;
then one of the soldiers fired into the group of the children .
&quot; a child , 16 @-@ year @-@ old Y@@ uli@@ anus Y@@ eim@@ o , was so badly beaten that he fell into coma . &quot;
a few hours later the building of the nearby government commission was set on fire and the things escal@@ ated the next day .
&quot; about 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football field in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice . &quot;
they wore cerem@@ onial hunting bows and carried the orph@@ an@@ ette dance - running in circles and im@@ itating a bird song - from Pap@@ u@@ as Me@@ e P@@ ago tribe .
some demonstr@@ ators began to drag bricks onto police and military posts .
&quot; when the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent an order via an internal radio : &quot; &quot; if the masses resist more than three times , shoot them dead , &quot; &quot; it means in an official document of TI@@ ME which has not been released to the local media . &quot;
&quot; Y@@ er@@ em@@ ias Kay@@ ame , 56 , head of the K@@ ego K@@ oto district of En@@ cir@@ ali , saw the im@@ minent danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home . &quot;
nobody was able to listen to the mood .
&quot; when I turned around , I was suddenly shot in my left wrist , &quot; &quot; he said to TI@@ ME on the ver@@ and@@ ah of his colorful painted wooden house . &quot;
&quot; Kay@@ ame still doesn &apos;t know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here . &quot;
&quot; it was crowded , many shots were fired , &quot; he adds . &quot;
&quot; the native man Al@@ fi@@ us You@@ w was hit three times , so his cous@@ in , who witnessed the shooting . &quot;
&quot; I ran to him and examined his body to make sure that he was , &quot; &quot; said Y@@ oh@@ ane , who just holds a name like many Indon@@ esi@@ ans , the TI@@ ME in glo@@ omy mood . &quot;
I saw that he was dead ... I kis@@ sed him .
&quot; the chief inspec@@ tor of the Papua police , Y@@ ot@@ je Men@@ de , told re@@ porters that his officers only wanted to &quot; back up &quot; their station because they were attacked . &quot;
&quot; we must defend ourselves if people thre@@ aten to kill us , &quot; said the spokes@@ man of the Papua police , Commissioner Pu@@ d@@ jo Sul@@ isti@@ yo , in 2015 . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life and death . &quot;
&quot; according to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstr@@ ators were killed and many others were injured . &quot;
the news about the kill@@ ings came only on the following day &apos; filtered &apos; to Jak@@ arta .
&quot; three weeks Jok@@ ow@@ i held a passionate speech in J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura , in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and s@@ wore to address the historical gri@@ ev@@ ances in Papua . &quot;
&quot; I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will no longer happen in the future , &quot; he said . &quot;
Minister of Security Wi@@ ran@@ to said in October 2016 that he will set out an extra@@ judicial mechanism to commit historical violations of human rights .
but the exc@@ uses began almost immediately .
&quot; most of the injuries occurred long ago .
some were in the 90 &apos;s and at the beginning of the 2000 @-@ s .
&quot; the point is that we have committed to tackle these violations , but there are processes that must be tra@@ vers@@ ed , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; then Wi@@ ran@@ to with@@ drew when he spoke to TI@@ ME on June 5 in Jak@@ arta , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint in Papua . &quot;
&quot; instead , everything is regulated by law , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; Wi@@ ran@@ to , which the UN has accused of &quot; crimes against humanity , &quot; claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Tim@@ or &apos;s bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations were already attached in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai incident . &quot;
families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims faced such claims with gri@@ m in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity .
&quot; I was inter@@ viewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress whatsoever , &quot; says Y@@ oh@@ ane . &quot;
&quot; I am tired . &quot;
he says that he still lives in fear years later .
&quot; I &apos;m afraid , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I am afraid of being arrested by the military , I am afraid to be shot . &quot;
his brother Y@@ ac@@ inth reiter@@ ated the view that people in Pan@@ i@@ ai are afraid to discuss the incident .
he says he was struck by the military after he helped bury four of the victims .
&quot; after I buried the corp@@ ses , the military sought me , &quot; he says . &quot;
the sho@@ ot@@ ings have not ceased .
&quot; on Tuesday , the Indon@@ esian police shot villa@@ gers in the town of Pan@@ i@@ ais neighborhood Dei@@ y@@ ai . &quot;
&quot; during a confrontation between villa@@ gers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a man unconscious to the hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children . &quot;
&quot; the man , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old R@@ avi@@ anus Dou@@ w , drow@@ ned when he f@@ ished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . &quot;
excited villa@@ gers prot@@ ested in front of the company &apos;s office .
the police said that the villa@@ gers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .
but natives say that the mobile Brig@@ ade ( Indon@@ esian param@@ il@@ itary police ) started to shoot the crowd and killed one .
&quot; we were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , &quot; says the 29 @-@ year @-@ old Dom@@ ing@@ gu Ba@@ di@@ i , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered here , so the TI@@ ME . &quot;
&quot; I hid myself two days in my house . &quot;
the Dei@@ y@@ ai parliament has called for an account of the officers involved and withdraw the police bri@@ g@@ ade of the police .
Pan@@ i@@ ai was always an im@@ print for the Indon@@ esian government .
&quot; the lack of meaningful development strengthens the dis@@ content of the family members Me@@ e , Mon@@ i , Dan@@ i and dam@@ al , who live in the green high@@ lands of Papua . &quot;
&quot; many joined the &quot; Free Papua movement &quot; ( O@@ PM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of Papua by raising spor@@ adi@@ c attacks and kidn@@ app@@ ings of Indon@@ esian soldiers . &quot;
&quot; some of the top O@@ PM leaders come from Pan@@ i@@ ai , among them Ta@@ di@@ us Yo@@ gi and Daniel Yu@@ das Ko@@ go@@ ya . &quot;
&quot; in response to this , thousands of people in Pan@@ i@@ ai were arrested and arbitr@@ arily taken into custody under the pre@@ text of &quot; safegu@@ arding national sovereignty . &quot; &quot;
some never appear again .
&quot; among the people in Papua , Pan@@ i@@ ai is known as &quot; a tragic , forgotten place . &quot; &quot;
poverty boo@@ sts dis@@ satisfaction .
&quot; the little rice , which is sold in En@@ ligh@@ ali , is too expensive for locals . &quot;
bread is also out of reach .
people here build everything they eat : especially not@@ a and fruit and leaf@@ y vegetables .
agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .
they retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .
ten pieces of Not@@ a only cost 10.000 Indon@@ esian ru@@ pe@@ es ( 75 c@@ ents ) .
&quot; over time , economic ine@@ qualities between the native countries of Papua and the new migrants have grown , which have arrived in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the hub of Nab@@ ire . &quot;
the few jobs that exist in the region usually go to the better educated and prosper@@ ous migrants .
&quot; in Papua , they rarely have the capital or skills necessary to make their own companies competitive . &quot;
&quot; young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for there is no jobs or money , &quot; says John Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the Pan@@ i@@ ai tribe . &quot;
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .
&quot; in addition , restrictions on reporting international media remain ten@@ se . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , French journalists Fran@@ ck Esc@@ u@@ das and Ba@@ sil@@ le Long@@ ch@@ amp were deported from Papua because of lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they gave them a rare permit for filming . &quot;
&quot; according to P@@ hel@@ im K@@ ine , the Deputy Asia Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jok@@ ow@@ is electoral campaign to lift the restrictions of reporting to promote transparency and development are not realized . &quot;
&quot; there are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia &apos;s un@@ rest eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa denial and a black list , &quot; &quot; he said in an explanation . &quot;
lack of press control means that international pressure on Indon@@ esian government is largely restricted to the immediate neighbours of Pap@@ u@@ as .
&quot; in March , six Pacific states - T@@ ong@@ a , Nau@@ ru , Palau , Tu@@ val@@ u , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - demanded the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the &quot; various and widespread injuries &quot; in Papua , including the Pan@@ i@@ ai shooting . &quot;
the same countries have historically supported the O@@ PM .
&quot; the spokes@@ man of the Indon@@ esian State Department of Ar@@ r@@ man@@ ath@@ a N@@ asi@@ r rejected the alle@@ gations of the group and said journalists in Jak@@ arta : &quot; &quot; in Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there are free media so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . &quot;
people on the spot want more foreign governments to take note of this .
&quot; when an official delegation from the Netherlands , headed by the Human Rights Ambassador K@@ ees Van Ba@@ ar , visited J@@ ay@@ ap@@ ura on May 4 , local residents broke their silence and urged him &quot; We want freedom , &quot; according to a source that also attended the meeting , but would like to remain anonymous . &quot;
&quot; Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua people say they will probably not be able to vote for Jok@@ ow@@ i . &quot;
&quot; Jok@@ ow@@ i is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Pan@@ i@@ ai shots , &quot; &quot; says Gob@@ ai , Chairman of the tribal council . &quot;
&quot; he wants Jok@@ ow@@ i know that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , aside from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predat@@ ory military , is in poor educational and health services . &quot;
&quot; Gob@@ ai says that the Pan@@ i@@ ai people , like other Papua people , consider Jok@@ ow@@ i as a &quot; &quot; guilt &quot; &quot; that he has to pay back . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t need money , they just want justice , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; despite threats and in@@ timi@@ dation , families of the Pan@@ i@@ ai victims led a last symbolic act of de@@ fi@@ ance : the corp@@ se of an victim was buried in a terrain exactly opposite the police and the military station . &quot;
&quot; they know that perhaps they will never come to justice , but at least they do not forget those responsible for their crimes . &quot;
&quot; a member of our family has been killed , &quot; says Y@@ ac@@ obus with a lowered head . &quot;
&quot; what else can we do ? &quot;
fire record the &apos; Tor@@ ch &apos; sky@@ scra@@ per from Dubai for the second time
&quot; a fire took place on Friday in one of the highest towers in the world in Dubai , and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 3@@ 37 metre high , 79 @-@ storey building . &quot;
&quot; it is the second fire that is sweeping through the high @-@ rise building in only two years , which is acci@@ dentally called the Tor@@ ch Tower ( F@@ ack@@ el Tower ) . &quot;
&quot; the building was evacu@@ ated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . &quot;
&quot; we slept and we got up at the fire alarm and shou@@ ting the people .
&quot; we ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50@@ th floor , &quot; an inhabit@@ ant told his name as George ang@@ ab , Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Dubai &apos;s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting units dropped fire at 4.@@ 00 a.m. local time ( 00@@ .00 GMT ) and cooled down the building .
the government said that she is working on providing accommodation to those affected .
the incident can revi@@ ve questions on the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high @-@ rise buildings around the world .
&quot; an investigation by the management of the Tor@@ ch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damages from facing , exterior cl@@ adding to decoration or insulation came . &quot;
&quot; in Great Britain , the police said that the system of plates for insulation and cl@@ adding at the London Gren@@ fell Tower could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died . &quot;
no Davis Cup Reform : next Best @-@ of @-@ five
the President of the International Tennis Association ( IT@@ F ) has passed the General Assembly with his great Davis Cup Cou@@ p .
&quot; at the Ho Chi Min@@ h City session , the proposal for this sport was to play a revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup single only on two sets of profit , spar@@ sely not supported by the necessary two @-@ thirds majority . &quot;
&quot; these often very long , but also therefore very much appreciated five @-@ set classics remain the traditional competition . &quot;
&quot; 6@@ 3.@@ 54 percent of member states voted for reform , the goal of IT@@ F President David Hag@@ ger@@ ty was therefore only margin@@ ally missed . &quot;
&quot; we respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not accepted the whole reform package for the Davis Cup and the F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need a change to secure the long @-@ term future of these iconic and historical competitions , &quot; &quot; said Hag@@ ger@@ ty . &quot;
one will continue to work on improving the application .
&quot; not until the vote , after many in@@ consisten@@ cies , the proposal came before the proposal to take the final in a neutral place . &quot;
&quot; new from 2018 is only comparatively small details : in the next year , the fin@@ alists will have the host right in the next round of the Davis Cup and F@@ ed Cup . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places etc. are facilit@@ ated , and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; more than 1 of 5 American travelers brings prohibited objects to the aircraft , finds a survey &quot;
&quot; a survey conducted among air passengers found that more than 20 percent conscious or un@@ consciously banned items passed by the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while they acci@@ dentally carried forbidden knives or other items with blades . &quot;
&quot; less than 1 per cent claimed they had discovered late that they were mistaken for fire@@ arms , amm@@ uni@@ tion or explo@@ sives . &quot;
&quot; the survey conducted by more than 1,000 people - which was conducted by a jet charter service , Str@@ at@@ os Jet Char@@ ters Inc . - also noted that younger travellers are more likely to ignore the rules . &quot;
&quot; those sur@@ vey@@ ed who admitted that they know@@ ingly tried to fly with something forbidden by the T@@ SA were 19.@@ 7 percent mill@@ enni@@ als , compared with less than 15 percent , the members of the generation X . &quot;
the most common items that were deliberately passed by T@@ SA agents were food and liquids .
&quot; more than 3 percent said to know@@ ingly carried items with blades by security control , while 2,@@ 2 percent of female respon@@ dents and 3.@@ 7 percent of the male sur@@ vey@@ ors also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; the company said it asked travellers around the country to find out how many in@@ ad@@ vert@@ ently smu@@ g@@ gled goods would have brought smu@@ g@@ gling safety , and how many had deliberately done it . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that people who are most likely smu@@ g@@ gling goods - know@@ ingly or unknow@@ ingly - carry through safety , those who frequently fly . &quot;
&quot; however , the company points out that the T@@ SA guidelines are a bit complicated and conf@@ using . &quot;
people are often unsure which fluids they are allowed to take with or how much of it .
it is therefore no surprise that the largest quantity of items confis@@ cated by the T@@ SA are forbidden liquids .
&quot; for a while , people thought that the T@@ SA could watch books as smu@@ g@@ gled goods . &quot;
&quot; liquids are allowed on inland flights , but not on international flights . &quot;
El@@ on Mus@@ k doesn &apos;t matter : tens of thousands of Tes@@ la customers cancel orders
electric thous@@ and@@ ass@@ a El@@ on Mus@@ k is delighted with the huge number of pre @-@ orders for his new Tes@@ la &quot; Model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , he has so far under@@ estimated that some of the customers have already with@@ drew their non @-@ binding reservation . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the ever @-@ trium@@ phant numbers on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tes@@ la boss El@@ on Mus@@ k has for the first time betra@@ yed another , less da@@ zz@@ ling figure for the first time in the announcement of the latest quar@@ terly results : the pen@@ alties for the new mass market model 3 . &quot;
&quot; in the past few months , Mus@@ k has frequently tou@@ red with the more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery has just begun . &quot;
&quot; Mus@@ k now cle@@ ars : of the 5@@ 18@@ ,000 pre @-@ orders , 6@@ 3.000 have already been re@@ trac@@ ted . &quot;
critics always pointed out that there are only non @-@ binding reservations .
&quot; in case of a cancellation , Tes@@ la pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK 1000 pounds ) &quot; &quot; reservation payment &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; currently 45@@ ,000 of these non @-@ binding reservations envis@@ age , in a telephone conference , Mus@@ k entered into a telephone conference with analysts . &quot;
&quot; however , the Tes@@ la boss does not believe that the cancellation of up to 12 percent of all orders could become a problem . &quot;
&quot; his argument : the challenge for ambitious growth targets is not in demand , but on the production side . &quot;
&quot; last year , Tes@@ la delivered 8@@ 4,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; in 2018 , all models will be taken together - 500,000 will be one million by 2020 . &quot;
the demand for this is obvious .
according to Mus@@ k there are 1800 reservations per day .
&quot; who orders a &quot; Model 3 &quot; at the earliest can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - when Tes@@ la manages to drive his brand @-@ new , never @-@ ever @-@ tested production lines with maximum capacity utilization . &quot;
many experts doubt that this is possible .
&quot; but if there are bigger delays , then the lack of reservations may become a problem for Tes@@ la . &quot;
&quot; for then , the company cannot prevent dis@@ satisfied customers from running away in dro@@ ves . &quot;
EPA CEO P@@ ru@@ itt withdraw@@ s from Obama @-@ Er@@ a &apos;s reluct@@ ance to reduce emissions
&quot; a day after he was su@@ ed by 15 states , Scott P@@ ru@@ itt , the head of the environmental protection authority , took his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the rules of the Obama era to reduce emissions of Smo@@ g @-@ causing air pollutants . &quot;
P@@ ru@@ itt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administr@@ ations .
he did not mention the law@@ suit raised against his previous post in a Federal Court of Appe@@ al .
&quot; it is a deadline , which ran for States on 1 October , in order to comply with the 2015 O@@ zone standards . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt announced in June that he would delay compliance with one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid &quot; &quot; interfer@@ ing with local decisions or hin@@ dering economic growth . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt , before his appointment by President Donald Tru@@ mp Public Prosecutor of Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a , has long been a reliable opponent of severe environmental protection regulations . &quot;
&quot; since its arrival in Washington , P@@ ru@@ itt has repeatedly transgres@@ sed to block or delay regulation that resist@@ s the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels . &quot;
the sudden revers@@ al of Wednesday is the most recent legal set@@ back for the P@@ ru@@ itment regulatory roll back agenda .
&quot; last month , a Federal Court of Appe@@ als in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leak@@ age . &quot;
&quot; in a statement issued on Wednesday evening , P@@ ru@@ itt proposed that its revers@@ al in o@@ zone standards simply repe@@ ats the willingness of EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely completion of the new standards . &quot;
&quot; under previous administr@@ ations , the EPA has often failed to meet deadlines for execution and then waited for being charged by activ@@ ist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , &quot; said P@@ ru@@ itt , who accused the EPA more than a dozen times in its previous job . &quot;
&quot; we do not believe in regulation by court proceedings , and we take deadlines serious . &quot;
we also take the law and the authority it gives us seriously .
&quot; nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that P@@ ru@@ itt eventually will use his &quot; authority to delay and all other legally available authority &quot; to ensure that the provisions are based on a solid policy and the best available information . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in Congress push for a more comprehensive re @-@ version of the o@@ zone rules .

Tum@@ our celebrates 50@@ th anniversary of St. Hil@@ arius Church
&quot; 750 years of St. Hil@@ arius Church : on the occasion of the anniversary of the Berg@@ kirche , the old cemetery area in Tum@@ lingen will be invited to a Ser@@ en@@ ade at 4.@@ 30 p.m. on Sunday 16 July . &quot;
&quot; whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hil@@ arius facility is a popular place to stay . &quot;
the visitors of the 6th Bene@@ fi@@ z Ser@@ en@@ ade can be en@@ chanted by this powerful place .
the rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made Tum@@ lin@@ ois a cause for their concerns .
Walter Mart@@ ini emphasizes : &quot; it is a unique village gem . &quot;
&quot; in 12@@ 67 the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württem@@ berg@@ ische Jahr@@ buch , &quot; Count Hermann von Sul@@ z sold &quot; the mountain with the parish church of Tum@@ lingen and the Vo@@ g@@ bey &quot; at the Magi@@ ster Eber@@ hard von Hor@@ b and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver . &quot;
&quot; according to the wording of the document , on the Hill of Tum@@ our , besides the former parish church , there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round . &quot;
so there were also people there .
&quot; as from the description of the Ober@@ am@@ tes Freuden@@ stadt from 18@@ 58 , it was beside the Unter@@ dorf and the Ober@@ dorf that are still visible today in the town @-@ picture of Tum@@ lingen , the &quot; mountain &quot; of the third , the magnificent settlement @-@ core of the village . &quot;
old maps dating back to 1600 reinforce these historical circumstances .
the right of pat@@ ron@@ age arose from the early medieval church law .
&quot; a gentle@@ man who built a church and occupied himself with a parish priest , remained owner of this church and could also bequ@@ e@@ ath@@ ed this church . &quot;
this was associated with the right to use a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop .
there were three alt@@ ars in the church and two bells on the tower .
the elder of the two rocks at Christmas 16@@ 73 .
&quot; the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 16@@ 92 , but was later to be given in the Second World War in 1942 . &quot;
&quot; in the Thi@@ r@@ ty Years &apos; War ( 16@@ 16 to 16@@ 48 ) , the windows were sm@@ ashed and the bell pieces were stolen . &quot;
the roof was leak@@ y .
17@@ 96 French troops camped near the church .
they removed the pul@@ pit and church chairs and used it as fire@@ wood .
the remains of the church were threatened to fall in 18@@ 09 .
&quot; until 18@@ 69 , the Tum@@ linger Hil@@ arius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hör@@ schwei@@ ler . &quot;
in 18@@ 23 the cemetery was extended and the Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ kirche was abandoned .
only the church tower was left standing .
in the New Year &apos;s Eve in 18@@ 34 a storm broke the church tower and half collap@@ sed .
&quot; to prevent mis@@ fortune , the tower was abandoned . &quot;
only the tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness of the 750 @-@ year @-@ old church history .
&quot; today , Horst K@@ all@@ berger and Rolf @-@ Dieter Was@@ em maintain the Hil@@ arius facility as the successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn as successor of Dieter Do@@ ck@@ horn . &quot;
&quot; the organizers invite the friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ ois on Sunday , July 16 , to the sixth Ser@@ en@@ ade on the old cemetery to the St. Hil@@ ari@@ us@@ Chapel . &quot;
it is designed by the Com@@ bo of the Ke@@ pler Gramm@@ ar School Freuden@@ stadt and with essays by Kurt Kü@@ bler and Rein@@ hold Mat@@ tei@@ s .
&quot; Hart@@ mut Rom@@ ann , a local leader , speaks the closing word . &quot;
the program starts at 4.@@ 30 p.m .
admission is starting at 3.@@ 30 p.m .
&quot; to conclude the seren@@ ade , a trunk takes place in front of the cemetery . &quot;
&quot; enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over meadows towards the forest , the organizers expose the fantastic view . &quot;
the Ser@@ en@@ ade takes place only in dry weather .
&quot; the organizers are hoping for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hil@@ arius plant , which is important for tum@@ ul@@ ls and audi@@ tors . &quot;
friends and promot@@ ers of Tum@@ lin@@ ois feel particularly committed to home care as Ser@@ en@@ ade organis@@ er Walter Mart@@ ini re@@ affir@@ med .
association wants to let approval of wind turbines be checked
&quot; &quot; &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim resist@@ s &quot; &quot; sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the coun@@ cill@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the Bo@@ is@@ heim Association has called for &quot; &quot; Land@@ rat Andreas Co@@ enen ( CD@@ U ) to take his permit for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette . &quot;
it is illegal .
&quot; the association argued that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette , no wind turbines could have been approved , since at the time in Vier@@ sen only a wind force concentration zone exists in Vier@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes a exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city . &quot;
such zones shall prevent a &quot; conservation &quot; of the landscape .
&quot; the city of Vier@@ sen had decided a second wind force concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heim N@@ ette a few days earlier , but the city council of Düsseldorf had not approved the district government because of a lack of form . &quot;
&quot; due to the lack of planning legal requirements , the granted approval process is still un@@ lawful and therefore to be rejected , &quot; &quot; said Christoph Er@@ k@@ ens , Chairman of &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; current state of affairs : before the summer break , the City Council once again approved the wind concentration zone in the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette ; approval by the district government is still pending . &quot;
&quot; Er@@ k@@ ens : &quot; at this point , the issu@@ ance of a permit for the construction of wind turbines is excluded as planned . &quot;
the circle confirms the entrance of the request .
&quot; the corresponding writings have been received by the circle of Vier@@ sen since last week , &quot; &quot; said a spokes@@ man . &quot;
the circle takes her to examine the matter again .
&quot; however , they do not expect the procedure to be stopped . &quot;
&quot; with regard to ongoing proceedings at the Administr@@ ative Court , the circle on Thursday did not want to express itself to the argum@@ entation of the association &quot; Bo@@ is@@ heim . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning to build four each 200 @-@ metre @-@ high wind turbines on an area at the Bo@@ is@@ heimer N@@ ette . &quot;
&quot; last year , the company , in which the city of Vier@@ sen is indirectly involved , closed lease agreements with the owner of the approximately 65 hect@@ are area . &quot;
&quot; with the establishment of the four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households should be covered - this corresponds to roughly one fifth of the electricity needs of all four households . &quot;
the NEW re wants to invest some 20 million euros .
&quot; last summer , Vier@@ sen &apos;s City Council gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines in the Lin@@ ni@@ ch wind farm near Aachen , as well as participating in a wind turbine plant in Ü@@ bach @-@ Pal@@ enberg in the Hein@@ sberg district . &quot;
car and tractor crashing together : woman dies in a terrible accident
a terrible traffic accident happened on Friday morning at 10 am on the L 3@@ 33 between Nieder@@ wall@@ ab@@ ach and Bo@@ gel ( Rhine @-@ L@@ ahn @-@ Kreis ) .
a woman was wounded in death .
two more persons were slightly injured .
the national road remained closed for hours .
&quot; according to police information , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old young woman from Bor@@ ni@@ ch , with her passenger car , entered the L 3@@ 33 in the direction of Bo@@ gel with her 53 @-@ year @-@ old mother as a companion . &quot;
city and merchants plan &quot; home shopping &quot; weekend
bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ a and people from the region are expected to re@@ discover the shopping facilities in the city centre in September .
the Gewerbe@@ verein and the municipal administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to enti@@ ce the inhabitants to the shopping spre@@ e into the city centre .
&quot; as the Chairman of the Gewerbe@@ verein , Christian König , announced that the &quot; &quot; home @-@ shopping &quot; &quot; weekend should sensi@@ ti@@ ze customers to what offers the town offers apart from the usual supermarket goods . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market . &quot;
&quot; in addition , local firms should present themselves with their apprenticeship places . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to &quot; &quot; midnight shopping &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the action does not only aim at inhabitants of the city and the closer region .
&quot; in preparation , commerci@@ als are on the radio , an internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian König . &quot;
municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Industry and Commerce .
&quot; thus , the Gewerbe@@ verein and the city go into another stage of the project &quot; Attrac@@ tive city centre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this includes new offers such as the first &quot; &quot; Active Day &quot; &quot; for the well @-@ held Sunday , with sales so@@ ff@@ led Sunday , talks with all tra@@ des@@ people and hosts to move them to active participation . &quot;
attractive offers on Saturday and the wai@@ ver of parking fees this day are part of the concept .
&quot; in addition , customer potentials should be re @-@ developed or re @-@ opened . &quot;
this includes spa guests and tourists .
but also many locals would have lost the city centre while shopping .
&quot; in the end everyone would have to help anim@@ ate the inner city - up to land@@ lords , the factories of the whole city and clubs . &quot;
&quot; it was necessary to overcome the le@@ th@@ ar@@ gy with a network , which partly became wider , had told King in the spring . &quot;
&quot; Birgit St@@ reich , head of the Chamber of Commerce in Müh@@ l@@ hausen , said that the third &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; takes part in the country &apos;s third &quot; &quot; home shopping &quot; &quot; day , for the first time five Thurin@@ gian cities . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Bad Lan@@ gen@@ sal@@ za , this is Weimar , S@@ ö@@ mmer@@ da , Hei@@ ligen@@ stadt and B@@ leich@@ ero@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the day should &quot; &quot; promote the appreciation of local trade and strengthen its significance for the common welfare of our cities , &quot; &quot; says St@@ reich . &quot;
the action under the leadership of the Chamber of Commerce and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his direct surroundings with his buying behaviour .

Tru@@ mp replaced after sever@@ ed tran@@ scripts of phone calls Mexico under pressure because of the payment of the border wall
tran@@ scripts of phone calls between US President Donald Tru@@ mp and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .
&quot; on January 27 , Tru@@ mp requested in a telephone conversation with Mexican President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to to publicly say that he would not pay for a planned border wall . &quot;
&quot; the US president called on him because he publicly den@@ ounced the wall . according to reports , he said to him , &quot; &quot; You can &apos;t tell the press . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall at the southern border of the US , and s@@ wore to let Mexico pay for the project . &quot;
tran@@ scripts of his first call with the Australian prime minister Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull have also been published and revealed a ten@@ se exchange .
&quot; Mr. Tru@@ mp told Mr. Turn@@ bull that a trade for the USA was &quot; ridi@@ culous , &quot; &quot; mies &quot; and &quot; stupid , &quot; and that the existence on the trade that was im@@ par@@ ted by the Obama administration would make him look like a &quot; fool &quot; after he had proposed a ban on the reloc@@ ation of refugees to the United States . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp ended the call after he had said Mr. Turn@@ bull : &quot; this is the most unpleasant call for the whole day .
Mo@@ ore Ford massacre : activists perform rac@@ ist Lyn@@ ch@@ act as a call for justice
&quot; a 1948 @-@ long Ford Mer@@ cury drove through a group of spectators in Mon@@ ro@@ e , Georgia , and shr@@ unk to the Ford @-@ Bridge of Mo@@ ore . &quot;
&quot; before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way . &quot;
the leader of the mo@@ b - a middle @-@ aged man in a con@@ i@@ fer &apos;s suit - took a long train at his ci@@ gar and looked through the wind@@ shield .
inside the occup@@ ants were floating in fear .
&quot; we want this n --@@ -- r Roger ! &quot; the man ro@@ ared .
&quot; get it out of the car ! &quot; &quot; &quot;
scre@@ am tore the silence when a young black man was torn off by the passenger seat .
&quot; fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22nd , is just a post@@ war . &quot;
&quot; but when a loop around the neck of &quot; &quot; Roger &quot; &quot; is thrown , almost everyone in the audience threw out very real si@@ gh . &quot;
&quot; since 2005 citizens of Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge come back to im@@ itate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dor@@ oth@@ y Mal@@ com , as well as George and Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray Dor@@ sey - were du@@ bbed by the K@@ u Klu@@ x Kl@@ an in 1946 . &quot;
no one ever was accused of mur@@ ders .
&quot; it is really in@@ comprehensible that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we see them in our churches , although we know who they are , &quot; &quot; said Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks , who helps with the organization of the post@@ war . &quot;
&quot; it is a stain on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . &quot;
Broo@@ ks is a 71 @-@ year @-@ old former con@@ gres@@ sman of the state of Georgia and a life of civil rights activists .
&quot; for him , post@@ war serves as a dramatic call to action and represents an annual reminder of the Mon@@ ro@@ e community that injustice has never been corrected . &quot;
&quot; we want prosecution , we want to end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , &quot; he said . &quot;
we cannot come to healing and reconciliation until we receive justice .
&quot; a court physician lays down a sheet about the corp@@ se of one of the victims of the Mo@@ ore @-@ Ford @-@ Lyn@@ sel on July 27 , 1946 . &quot;
&quot; according to FBI files received by N@@ BC News , more than 50 men from Mon@@ ro@@ e and the surrounding coun@@ ties were suspected in the Lyn@@ ch@@ process . &quot;
but none was ever accused .
&quot; although the susp@@ ects have been free for decades , citizens voters say that the dual motivation for Lyn@@ ch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex . &quot;
&quot; in April 1946 , a decision of the Supreme Court of Justice allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote their vote for the first time in the summer . &quot;
&quot; approximately at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Mal@@ com asked a white land@@ owner , Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman . &quot;
Broo@@ ks said the rum@@ our in the city had been that H@@ ester had slept with Mal@@ com@@ s &apos;s wife Dor@@ oth@@ y and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .
&quot; on July 25 , 1946 Lo@@ y Har@@ rison , a prominent white land@@ owner , paid $ 600 to free Mal@@ com from prison , so the FBI . &quot;
he was accompanied by Dor@@ oth@@ y and her cous@@ ins Ma@@ e Mur@@ ray and George Dor@@ sey .
&quot; but when they removed from prison and approached the Mo@@ ore &apos;s Ford Bridge , a Lyn@@ ch@@ mo@@ b surrounded the car . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , it was Har@@ rison who prepared and ordered the kill@@ ings , &quot; concludes an FBI report . &quot;
&quot; it is also obvious that there was a plot between national and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the kill@@ ings , removed evidence and had disgu@@ ised the identity of witnesses . &quot;
Broo@@ ks formul@@ ates it even more conc@@ ise .
&quot; it was an electoral law massacre , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; they were all killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : &quot; &quot; when you register and when you vote , this will happen to you . &quot;
&quot; for almost a decade , Cass@@ andra Gre@@ ene has led the annual production of Mo@@ ore Ford Bridge Lyn@@ ch @-@ Mor@@ de . &quot;
&quot; their representation is vivid , gri@@ pping , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism , of which many would like to believe that he no longer exists in America . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to watch , and still more difficult to look , but Gre@@ ene said that it &apos;s the point . &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t want to talk about the ly@@ n@@ ching , because we are confronted with its ug@@ liness in all of us , &quot; she said . &quot;
but I can &apos;t build a relationship with you if you don &apos;t want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done .
&quot; the rehear@@ sals for this year &apos;s production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest bl@@ acks - pushed into a room and listened as Gre@@ ene started a well @-@ rehear@@ sed survey of the piece . &quot;
W@@ ade Mar@@ bau@@ gh is a co @-@ director here .
&quot; he has played the role of chief clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier . &quot;
&quot; I feel dirty because I &apos;m not that way , &quot; &quot; said Mar@@ bau@@ gh . &quot;
but I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times .
&quot; on the other side of the room , actors Dar@@ rius Brad@@ sha@@ w and Nick Ras@@ cona , who play Roger Mal@@ com and Bar@@ nett H@@ ester , rehear@@ sed their lines . &quot;
&quot; the piece begins with Mal@@ com , the ester cries and presses him , fur@@ ious that he slept with his wife Dor@@ oth@@ y . &quot;
&quot; I said , n --- he disappeared from my property ! &quot;
&quot; As@@ cona , the fire , reci@@ proc@@ ates . &quot;
there is a break .
and then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into laughter .
Gre@@ ene laugh@@ ed at the lou@@ dest .
&quot; what ? ! , &quot; said Ras@@ cona . &quot;
he is al@@ armed and confused .
was I too hard ?
&quot; no , &quot; &quot; said Gre@@ ene , still smiling . &quot;
I simply don &apos;t think white people say &apos; n --- he &apos; back then .
&quot; but , &quot; &quot; T@@ wit@@ ched one of the other black performers . &quot;
&quot; you only have to hit the hard &quot; &quot; R. &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; and exactly there the energy shifts in space , a sense of compan@@ i@@ onship replaces the discomfort . &quot;
&quot; everyone is busy trying to get this right , not just because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people . &quot;
the scene starts again .
&quot; this time when Ras@@ cona says the N word , he says it sharp and with re@@ print . &quot;
absolutely no one laughs .
this repetition ends violent and fast .
&quot; there are cries , shots and then silence . &quot;
&quot; a woman , dressed in a dream dress , stands above the corp@@ ses of the actors and leads Bil@@ lie holidays gri@@ eving pra@@ ises &quot; St@@ range Fruit . &quot; &quot;
her voice breaks with every second word .
&quot; about a hundred metres behind , a group of about four dozen people wi@@ pes out sweat and tears from the eyes . &quot;
the audience is almost equally divided between black and white .
&quot; a couple came from I@@ th@@ aca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street . &quot;
&quot; they have experienced Geor@@ gi@@ as oppres@@ sive humidity for almost eight hours , when Broo@@ ks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graves of the Mal@@ com@@ s and Dor@@ se@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; until this point , the kill@@ ings have remained an an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lyn@@ ch kill@@ ings took place , the air feels sp@@ ook@@ y . &quot;
&quot; when the last notes of the song sound out , Gre@@ ene invites the crowd to come closer and inspect the body &apos;s bodies . &quot;
&quot; children ho@@ ck at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whis@@ pers each other . &quot;
&quot; they are not really dead , &quot; &quot; m@@ um@@ bles a little boy , as if he wanted to remember . &quot;
after a few minutes gre@@ ens thanks for the crowd - and suddenly it &apos;s over .
the actors throw away the ly@@ n@@ ching rope and wipe off their tears .
&quot; Brad@@ sha@@ w surrounded Mar@@ bau@@ gh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member . &quot;
&quot; Nick Ras@@ mus@@ h embra@@ ces two of his fellow players and then breaks together in her arms , the emotional burden of the performance finally breaks with him . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s okay , &quot; one of the women whis@@ pers . &quot;
we know that this is not in your heart .
you did that for one reason . &quot;
&quot; later , the audience sat together with the actors for dinner . &quot;
&quot; at a table , a white couple from Atlanta talk about the post @-@ setting with a black couple that they just met . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ise Du@@ pl@@ in@@ sky strug@@ gled to find words , which feeling the performance left behind . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... coming from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; what this really does with me makes me believe that the Lyn@@ x is still going on , &quot; she added , &quot; today the only police shooting is called &quot; police shooting . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the same room , Ty@@ rone Broo@@ ks is holding court at his table , eating and remin@@ ding citizens &apos; rights . &quot;
he said he began planning the performance next year .
&quot; the delivery is in a way inspiring , as it describes the hor@@ r@@ ors of what we have endu@@ red , but it is also a moment of learning , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; it is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again . &quot;
&quot; whoever does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . &quot;
&quot; Ar@@ ma@@ ged@@ don &quot; reconc@@ iled the W@@ agn@@ eri@@ ans in Bayreuth
&quot; in the fourth part of Richard Wagner &apos;s monumental work , director Frank Cast@@ orf sets out on a color@@ full @-@ fri@@ vol@@ ous production in front of a gigantic , six @-@ story setting . &quot;
&quot; the revol@@ ving stage ( designed by Ale@@ ks@@ and@@ ar D@@ EN@@ IC ) shows either a sh@@ ab@@ by street corner with wall rest and D@@ ön@@ er@@ bu@@ de in Berlin , a &quot; Poster and Ela@@ ste &quot; logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange . &quot;
&quot; before that , an open Mercedes classic car , in which the Rhein@@ mort@@ als pose as rock energies , or alternatively a Is@@ etta . &quot;
&quot; stolen oil barrels remind of Cast@@ or@@ fs &apos;s leit@@ motif - money , power and greed - that moves through its &quot; ring &quot; production . &quot;
&quot; the three Rhein@@ pf@@ chter - sung by Steph@@ anie Hou@@ tz@@ e@@ el , Wi@@ eb@@ ke L@@ ehm@@ ku@@ hl and Alexandra St@@ einer - harmon@@ ize as already in the &quot; Rhein@@ gold &quot; wonderful . &quot;
&quot; he seduc@@ es Siegfried ( Stefan Vin@@ ke ) , sh@@ atter a corp@@ se into the trunk in Hollywood @-@ style and give the Kra@@ wall@@ o @-@ Cli@@ que . &quot;
Stephen M@@ illing sings the wonderfully nasty Hagen surrounding the aura of a heavy @-@ weight box@@ ers .
brutal the scene as he sm@@ iled Siegfried .
later Gun@@ ther ( Markus oak ) still has to believe in it .
the audience would like to thank the ensemble with a strong applause .
&quot; Fo@@ ster , M@@ illing , Vin@@ ke and conductor Jan@@ owski are being celebrated stor@@ my @-@ stor@@ my , who mo@@ dest@@ ly bows his hands to the Merkel @-@ Rau@@ te . &quot;
&quot; there is a big applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in light of the great heat in casual leisure wear . &quot;
the performance of Frank Cast@@ orf and his team of directors was expected with excitement .
&quot; in 2013 he had to leave a source of the pipe concert over him , there were five years later great jubil@@ ation in which the single &quot; &quot; Bu@@ h &quot; &quot; calls went underground . &quot;
Fest@@ spiel@@ ch@@ ef@@ in Katharina Wagner is expected to be happy .
&quot; one notices that the audience with the &quot; &quot; ring &quot; &quot; has grown together in a certain way , &quot; &quot; she had said shortly before the performance of the d@@ pa . &quot;
&quot; the audience has not only made a form of peace with Cast@@ orf , but also an understanding of its view . &quot;
I draw a positive summary .
Max amount works as a volunteer
they work in their volunteer year at several locations .
where everywhere ?
&quot; quantity : normally in St@@ einf@@ urt in the Furn@@ iture Market , once a week I will help in Gre@@ ven in the furniture bridge . &quot;
and I have also worked at school in the open whole day .
what are your experiences with it ?
&quot; lot : it &apos;s a nice , wide spectrum that I see here . &quot;
&quot; I have to do with different people , with young people , with refugees , with young adults . &quot;
&quot; they are now 26 years , so a late @-@ called volunteer . &quot;
how does that happen ?
amount : I made Ab@@ itur .
&quot; and then a civil engineering graduate , let &apos;s say , successful abor@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; I recognized for myself that it is the wrong for me and I want to do something different , working with people . &quot;
&quot; and then I asked myself , what are you doing ? &quot;
&quot; make a social year , there is an insight , there you can see how it is on site , at the focal point maybe also , really is . &quot;
and was it so ?
crowd : I collected great impressions .
&quot; in the winter semester , I will start my studies in social affairs . &quot;
&quot; I will study dual , probably in the Ju@@ gen@@ dam@@ t Her@@ ne a social worker training and study at Ham@@ m at the University of Applied Sciences . &quot;
isn &apos;t it unusual to have several different locations during the volunteer service ?
&quot; amount : yes , it is very variable . &quot;
it always depends on where you are going to be FS@@ J .
you can make it from retirement home to youth work - in all sorts of facets of social work .
it was very varied with me .
&quot; I was also partly in the O@@ GS , so in afternoon care . &quot;
&quot; for me , this was exactly the right thing that irrit@@ ated me . &quot;
I was able to see my own strengths and see how it really works .
unlike in civil engineering studies ?
&quot; amount : well , here it &apos;s not about calculating the St@@ ati@@ ken . &quot;
&quot; one always has other people up@@ side down , each having a completely different story behind them . &quot;
&quot; whether a refugee , whether a teen@@ ager , who has been taken out of the family , must always be responsive to it . &quot;
very interesting .
and you had no reservations ?
quantity : I am not the guy for that .
it is an area that gives you a lot .
&quot; lots of love , great kindness . &quot;
&quot; there are also times negative moments , but that &apos;s how life is . &quot;
Pear@@ son cuts more 3.000 jobs and cuts the dividend to revi@@ ve the business
&quot; the British education group Pear@@ son said on Friday that they will cut another 3,000 jobs and cut their dividing dividend by 72 percent , as another restructuring programme will be launched to overcome the pressure that the company is facing . &quot;
&quot; job cuts , announced by General Director John Fall@@ on in 2018 and early 2019 , will also result in its previous restructuring , where 4,000 jobs have already been lost . &quot;
Pear@@ son announced plans to reduce costs by another 300 million pounds ( 3@@ 94 million US dollars ) in May in a third cost reduction programme to revi@@ ve a business that was hit by the quick pace of digital learning .
&quot; the company , which had sold its stake in Pen@@ guin Rand@@ om House to partner Ber@@ tel@@ smann last month , said that the outlook for the fiscal year remained unchanged after it achieved a 1 percent increase in the first half of the year to 2.@@ 05 billion pounds . &quot;
Kab@@ ul &apos;s con@@ voy attack : NATO soldier killed in suicide bombing
&quot; a suicide bom@@ ber attacked a military con@@ voy in the Afghan capital Kab@@ ul , killed a NATO soldier and injured several others , say officials . &quot;
five soldiers and an interpreter were injured and announced an explanation of NATO .
&quot; according to un@@ confirmed local reports , three civilians died during the incident in the district of Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h . &quot;
the bombing is the last violence that Afghanistan has hit this month - on Tuesday more than 30 people were killed in a mosque in Her@@ at .
&quot; on Monday , a suicide bom@@ ber killed two people near the Iraqi embassy in Kab@@ ul . &quot;
NATO &apos;s statement states that the explosion on Thursday night had happened when a joint pat@@ rol with the Afghan army was attacked by a &quot; impro@@ vised explosive device . &quot;
the statement states that all injured are in a stable state and are dealt with in the US military hospital on the B@@ agra@@ m air@@ field .
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the growing strength of the Taliban and the group , known as the so @-@ called Islamic State ( IS ) in Q@@ arab@@ ag@@ h , is a great concern for NATO troops in the nearby agra@@ m . &quot;
&quot; according to the United Nations , there were at least 1,@@ 6@@ 62 civilian cas@@ u@@ alties in Afghanistan in the first half of 2017 , about 20 % in the capital . &quot;
&quot; at the end of July , a suicide bom@@ ber killed at least 30 people in a chi@@ ef@@ ly Shi@@ ite district of Kab@@ ul . &quot;
the Taliban said they had executed this attack .
&quot; on 31 May , a massive bombar@@ d@@ ment in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the most deadly milit@@ ant attack of the country , since the US @-@ led troops in 2001 forced the Taliban out of power . &quot;
&quot; violence under@@ lines the prec@@ arious security situation in Afghanistan , as U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp is considering increasing the number of U.S. forces supporting the military and police in the country . &quot;
&quot; correspon@@ dents say that the suicide bom@@ b@@ ings in Kab@@ ul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , their policy and in particular in the call of President Ash@@ ra@@ f Gh@@ ani . &quot;
EPA returns a decision to delay the smo@@ g rule after col@@ lagen
&quot; the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has a decision to delay the regulation of the Obama administration , rev@@ oked that states are obliged to cur@@ b the Smo@@ g @-@ causing emissions . this resulted in a day after 15 states su@@ ed the agency because of the stri@@ de . &quot;
&quot; the EPA announced late on Wednesday the decision to drive forward the so @-@ called &quot; O@@ zone Regulation 2015 , &quot; and said it the obligation of the agency to cooperate with states . &quot;
&quot; we believe in dialogue with and that we are responding to our state partners , &quot; said EPA CEO Scott P@@ ru@@ itt in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; P@@ ru@@ itt had announced the intention of the EPA in June to determine the o@@ zone regulations , in which pollut@@ ant emissions are to be measured in a part of the country in order to comply with stric@@ ter air quality standards , in order to delay a year by October 2018 . &quot;
&quot; a group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed suit on Tuesday and said the effort was illegal . &quot;
&quot; the government of President Donald Tru@@ mp has tried to drive a wide range of environmental issues imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , which according to Tru@@ mp should boost economic growth . &quot;
&quot; however , efforts have triggered the demo@@ lition of demo@@ crats and nature conservation groups who are worried about the impact of greater emissions on public health . &quot;
&quot; the website of the EPA says that inhal@@ ing air , the o@@ zone contains &quot; &quot; reduce lung function and increase respiratory symptoms &quot; &quot; such as asthma . &quot;
municipal council wants common room
&quot; in the end , the decision was clear : the municipal council of Flu@@ orn @-@ Win@@ der resol@@ ves the establishment of a common room in the future retirement home . &quot;
&quot; before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase agreement for the missing land part was signed , reports mayor Bernhard T@@ j@@ aden . &quot;
&quot; although the church community is still owned by the church , there is no plan for planning a project to be stem@@ med from a private investor . &quot;
there is a discussion regarding a common area .
one of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .
&quot; on the ground floor , it would provide a living space - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price . &quot;
&quot; the administration and the majority of the Municipal Council ho@@ vers such a common room not to be seen as a meeting point for the residents of the sen@@ i@@ or@@ ous living , but openly in the congregation . &quot;
&quot; as an example , the word &quot; &quot; Stri@@ ck@@ café &quot; &quot; made the round . &quot;
&quot; the decision , which has already been decided by the provision of funds for the running household last autumn , will be decided by funding opportunities . &quot;
the building is located in the renovation area .
&quot; the establishment of a common room would be , according to T@@ j@@ aden , eligible for 60 percent of 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; the proposal envis@@ ages to signal the investor that in this respect one does not want to throw a stick between the legs , the conclusion that both sem@@ it@@ rail@@ ers - which are le@@ aning against the surrounding environment - would be possible to reduce the height and make the construction more economical . &quot;
&quot; need@@ less to say , not only Wil@@ fried Soh@@ mer writes , is this additive . &quot;
&quot; if it helps , it will pass the body unanim@@ ously . &quot;
not that easy is the common room .
&quot; Daniela &apos;s call refers to the many own buildings with which one can &apos;t progres@@ sing so well , but now you lean back to the common room out of the window , she says : &quot; I &apos;m hard working with it . &quot;
Y@@ von@@ ne Sta@@ iger is absolutely speaking for the common room - but absolutely against a municipal involvement .
it sees behind it a cover@@ t subsi@@ dy to already wealthy or even foreign investors .
&quot; this is not the case , because with the purchase of the surface one does not give a grant , but receives a real exchange value which is market@@ able in case of doubt , is the counter @-@ speech . &quot;
&quot; for Sta@@ y &apos;s request to ple@@ ad the proposal appropriately , there will be three pro@@ pon@@ ents . &quot;
&quot; with two counter@@ parts in the original program , Stefan H@@ aller summ@@ ari@@ zes : &quot; if we summ@@ ari@@ ze the decision , we take a huge step in closing a huge gap in our infrastructure . &quot;
collision with car : cycl@@ ist is thrown on road
&quot; when crossing the street , a 82 @-@ year @-@ old cycl@@ ist on Wednesday in Gar@@ ath was captured by a car and severely injured . &quot;
&quot; like the police , the 82 @-@ year long Lan@@ gen@@ felder was around 12.@@ 20 o &apos;clock with his bike on the bike path of the road Schwar@@ zer Weg from the direction Hil@@ den had been on the road . &quot;
the senior wanted to cross the road in the height of the road Am Buch@@ hol@@ zer Busch .
a passenger car driver in the same direction granted him priority .
&quot; when the Lan@@ gen@@ felder left the road , he obviously did not notice the traffic . &quot;
he met with a car that was driving a 66 @-@ year @-@ old Hil@@ den@@ ess .
the man was thrown on the street .
he suffered severe injuries and was taken to a hospital by a ambul@@ ance .
FC Bayern Munich has to abst@@ ain from the Super@@ cup against Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund on David Al@@ aba and Thi@@ ago
the Super@@ cup takes place without him : David Al@@ aba has to su@@ ck the game against Dortmund .
&quot; with personnel care , the FC Bayern will travel to Dortmund for the first mandatory match of the new season . &quot;
seven professionals are missing the title defender in the Super@@ cup against the Cup winner .
&quot; in front of the Super@@ cup on Saturday ( 8.@@ 30 PM / ZDF and Euro@@ sport ) , the staff of the German soccer world champion Bayern München are getting bigger at Pok@@ al@@ si@@ eger Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund . &quot;
trainer Carlo An@@ cel@@ otti has to go to David Al@@ aba in the du@@ el with the BV@@ B .
the Itali@@ ans confirmed this on Friday .
&quot; in addition , Manuel Neu@@ er , James , Thi@@ ago , Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng , Ar@@ j@@ en Rob@@ ben and Juan Bern@@ at are missing . &quot;
&quot; for the five defe@@ ats in the past six test games , An@@ cel@@ otti was responsible for the physical condition and lack of balance in his team &apos;s play . &quot;
&quot; we know that we are not in the best physical condition , &quot; An@@ cel@@ otti said , &quot; The most important point is the balance in the team . &quot;
&quot; last but not least , this was not good . &quot;
&quot; however , the 58 @-@ year @-@ old believes in an increase in performance in the first official mandatory match of the season . &quot;
&quot; football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation . &quot;
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .
the team is ready .
&quot; we want to play intelligent , &quot; said An@@ cel@@ otti , who expects a &quot; difficult , intense game . &quot; &quot;
the du@@ el of the two German football heav@@ y@@ weights attracts the fans .
&quot; the game is sold out with 8@@ 1,@@ 360 spectators , divided the German Football League ( DF@@ L ) on Friday . &quot;
in the resin of star to star
&quot; in the Harz , the nation @-@ wide first &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; will emerge . &quot;
this is the planning of the association Stern@@ warte Sankt Andre@@ as@@ berg .
there is a planet path in Göttingen - since 2003 .
&quot; a &quot; &quot; star path &quot; &quot; comes to the information needs of many har@@ z@@ go@@ ers , called it . &quot;
&quot; he combines nature , science , movement and athle@@ tic performance . &quot;
members want to set up boards along the planned route and inform about stars and con@@ stell@@ ations .
&quot; in a first phase until 2018 , the association plans &quot; well @-@ accessible installations at five to six locations &quot; in Ober@@ har@@ z . &quot;
&quot; question : St. Andre@@ as@@ berg , Braun@@ lage , Hoh@@ eg@@ ei@@ ß and Sie@@ ber . &quot;
the information on the panels should be supplemented by internet .
&quot; therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of s@@ iting regions . &quot;
accessibility is also a criterion .
&quot; later , the Star@@ path Ticket is to be extended by train . &quot;
&quot; on the star path , visitors learn a lot of interesting facts , such as the physics of the individual stars , &quot; declared the association . &quot;
&quot; they also learned why stars could have different colors , or why an ast@@ er@@ isk grew stronger than another , even though it was far further away . &quot;
&quot; also , in which con@@ stellation I will find a selected star and when it is best to see . &quot;
&quot; the association has already been operating in the mountain town of St. Andre@@ as@@ berg since 2014 , the highest located observ@@ atory in Northern Germany . &quot;
&quot; according to the Federal Office of Natural Protection , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six dark@@ est regions in Germany . &quot;
often from there the Mil@@ ky Way and even the Andro@@ med@@ a gal@@ axy with naked eye can be seen clearly .
&quot; since 2003 , at the initiative of the &quot; &quot; Förder@@ verein Planet@@ arium Göttingen &quot; &quot; there have been something similar to the planned star @-@ wer@@ g - the planet path since 2003 . &quot;
&quot; starting from Geb@@ har@@ ds Hotel in the Goe@@ the@@ alle@@ e , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Plan@@ etary Trail leads up to H@@ ain@@ berg and the Observ@@ atory - and an &quot; &quot; extra @-@ terrestrial &quot; &quot; location in Di@@ em@@ arden with the planet Sed@@ na . &quot;
the stel@@ ae with the individual planets - including the Plu@@ to degra@@ ded to the d@@ warf @-@ planet - are positioned exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .
&quot; the earth shr@@ inks to a diameter of 6.5 milli@@ meters in diameter , while the exact 75 metres distant sun measures 70 centimet@@ res . &quot;
the entire distance of the planet route is about four kilometres .
&quot; while the light from Sun to the Plu@@ to requires about eight hours , pedestri@@ ans need a good hour to the st@@ ele with Plu@@ to . &quot;
&quot; so , pedestri@@ ans are faster than the light in the cosmos . &quot;
the march to the next fixed star would take half a year .
Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia and Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko meet for the first time and discuss a possible show@@ down
&quot; Vas@@ yl Lom@@ ach@@ enko and Mi@@ key Gar@@ cia , who were to stand in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; they were in separate rooms at ES@@ PN offices in Los Angeles , until Gar@@ cia , the un@@ defeated world Bo@@ xing Council lightweight Champion , went down the hall@@ way to welcome Lom@@ ach@@ enko , the World Bo@@ xing Organisation super @-@ fe@@ ather@@ weight champion . &quot;
&quot; after Gar@@ cia &apos;s victory through unanim@@ ous vote on the former four @-@ division World Champion Adri@@ en Bron@@ er on Saturday at Show@@ time , both fighters are members of the Top Five Po@@ und @-@ for Po@@ und @-@ List . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia put out his right hand and said , &quot; &quot; How are you , champion ? &quot;
I wish you good luck . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko def@@ ends his belt against Miguel Mar@@ ri@@ aga on Saturday evening at 7 o &apos;clock on ES@@ PN .
&quot; when the pair posed for photos , Lom@@ ach@@ enko @-@ Manager Eg@@ is Kli@@ mas noticed that a possible show@@ down between the fighters would be the &quot; perfect order . &quot; &quot;
&quot; I am a former fe@@ ather @-@ weight , &quot; Gar@@ cia remembered . &quot;
&quot; I rose up for Bron@@ es &#91; to 140 pounds &#93; , but I &apos;m not so big . &quot;
I am small for 140 .
I &apos;d like to come down to light weight .
and he must move to light wei@@ ght@@ lers &#91; 135 pounds &#93; and then we fight .
that is what the fans demand .
let us give them this . &quot;
Lom@@ ach@@ enko agreed .
&quot; boxing needs this fight . &quot;
&quot; climate asked whether it should be Pay @-@ per @-@ View , part of a strategy that has to fight Lom@@ ach@@ enko with a 135 pound debut this year ( 37 @-@ 0 , 30 Kno@@ ck@@ outs ) who also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lin@@ ares @-@ Luke Camp@@ bell according to their lightweight title fight in the Forum on 23 September . &quot;
&quot; this battle could take place in the Pay @-@ per @-@ View mode because all the fans were asked for him , &quot; Gar@@ cia said and later pushed open to fight on the network that offers the best financial package . &quot;
we are the best .
no other names can generate this kind of attention .
whenever they are ready ... &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said he would like Lom@@ ach@@ enko as &quot; an enormous fighter , &quot; and he may take part in his Saturday combat . &quot;
&quot; but Lom@@ ach@@ enko refra@@ ined from pra@@ ising Gar@@ cia , saying that he thinks that the three @-@ fight champion from River@@ side is very slow , sorry Mi@@ key ... you wanted to co @-@ end . &quot;
&quot; Gar@@ cia said the focus was to show punch strength , then boxes . &quot;
both said they could feel the momentum that was built up for their own struggle .
this is the struggle that must be carried out .
no other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .
&quot; I &apos;m more than happy to work on it , &quot; Gar@@ cia said . &quot;
&quot; Lom@@ ach@@ enko said : &quot; &quot; I waited for the top fighters , and that &apos;s Mi@@ key . &quot;
it will be a great fight . &quot;
four injured after the tyre rup@@ ture
&quot; in an accident on the A@@ 7 , four people were severely injured on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; after the first information , the driver of an Opel Za@@ fir@@ a lost control over his vehicle at 4.@@ 30 p.m. shortly before the connection point in the market . &quot;
&quot; the car hur@@ led to the right into the em@@ bank@@ ment , where it over@@ came and then stood on the roof in the green strip . &quot;
the four occup@@ ants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .
&quot; during the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A@@ 7 was closed in the direction of the north for about an hour , afterwards the traffic on the left lane could be passed by accident site . &quot;
For@@ tun@@ as Hoffmann : &quot; tri@@ ck@@ ette works better &quot;
&quot; after the 2 : 2 season op@@ ener , and@@ re Hoffmann hopes for the improvement of the defensive formation in Au@@ e points . &quot;
&quot; with the first season of the season , Andr@@ e Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , too , because there weren &apos;t the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig . &quot;
&quot; that were two opponents too much , and we have to watch out better in Au@@ e , &quot; says the defense player of Fort@@ una Dus@@ sel@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; in the Or@@ e Mountains , the triple chain is to be further optimized . &quot;
&quot; and a gate after a breach , the For@@ tun@@ ics don &apos;t want to catch up any more . &quot;
&quot; for the future , there will be no more than Michael ( R@@ ens@@ ing ) on the line . &quot;
Hoffmann is convinced that his team gets better after the experiences in preparation with the triple chain than with the quad@@ rup@@ ed .
&quot; still I don &apos;t know how we will act in Au@@ e , &quot; says his trainer Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , but Hoffmann is confident in his case , &quot; because we have just been able to build up on the semi @-@ positions in Ka@@ an Ay@@ han and Ni@@ ko Gie@@ ß@@ el@@ mann who can build up well , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; the prerequisite is , however , that we are even better harmon@@ izing and we don &apos;t have so many playing mistakes in building up . &quot;
&quot; of course , Hoffmann also goes to Au@@ e to win the game . &quot;
&quot; but whether you can talk about a mis@@ guided start , you don &apos;t know . &quot;
&quot; the performance could be okay , &quot; Hoffmann said . &quot;
&quot; but if we can get four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the tro@@ phy , we will certainly be able to talk about a decent season op@@ ener . &quot;
his coach didn &apos;t want to know about it .
&quot; the start of the season will only be judged after six to eight days of play , &quot; said Fried@@ helm Funk@@ el , who doesn &apos;t want to talk about an advantage against Au@@ e just because the game of the Sax@@ ons in Hei@@ den@@ heim pre@@ mat@@ urely had to be cancelled because of a thunder@@ storm . &quot;
&quot; now they can start the season almost with a home game , &quot; said Funk@@ el and Hoffmann , that the players from Au@@ e might even be a bit more fresh because they wouldn &apos;t have a heavy and complete game like Fort@@ una against a ascension favorite in the bones . &quot;
&quot; but they don &apos;t know about 100 percent where they are at the moment , &quot; &quot; says the inner defense of Fort@@ una . &quot;
&quot; the guests from the Rhin@@ eland , as a light favourite on Sunday , go to the meeting at the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Au@@ e . &quot;
&quot; that we sweep them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six is bull@@ sh@@ it , &quot; says Funk@@ el , whose record is quite positive with only one defeat against Au@@ e from nine games . &quot;
&quot; there is no squ@@ ad in the 2nd Bundes@@ liga which you have to hit from the start , &quot; explains For@@ tun@@ as &apos;s chief coach . &quot;
to make such a statement would be arrogan@@ t and arrogan@@ t .
and so Funk@@ el doesn &apos;t want to experience his players on Sunday .
new results of Swedish asylum @-@ based application tests published
&quot; the latest results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method for medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 percent of the tested persons are older than 18 years . but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results . &quot;
the Swedish authorities for For@@ en@@ sic Medicine ( R@@ ät@@ ts@@ medic@@ in@@ al@@ verk@@ et ) started the tests last year .
&quot; during the asylum procedure , they should take a closer look at the assessment of the age after the Swedish Migration Authority ( Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et ) was critici@@ zed for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor . &quot;
&quot; until today , Mig@@ rations@@ verk@@ et sent 6,@@ 8@@ 80 to test cases and the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,@@ 4@@ 81 tests from the period from mid @-@ March to 31 July 2017 . &quot;
&quot; ei@@ ghty per cent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , whereas in other 25 cases the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was &quot; possibly 18 years or older . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 4@@ 32 cases , the conclusion that the person &quot; may be under 18 years of age . &quot;
the tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .
&quot; according to Johan Go@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months . &quot;
&quot; we see no big difference in the statistics of the past few months , the numbers are fairly constant , &quot; he said the magazine The Local . &quot;
the high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied over their age .
&quot; in May , the Agency published the results of 5@@ 81 tests and said that there were 4@@ 42 cases that &quot; suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older . &quot;
&quot; when the paper Sv@@ ens@@ ka D@@ ag@@ bla@@ det examined the 5@@ 81 published results , she noted that in 24@@ 3 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year . &quot;
&quot; the method of medical age assessment , where x @-@ rays of wisdom teeth and MRI images of knee joints are made , which are then analyzed by dentists and radi@@ ologists , has also been critic@@ ised in some areas . &quot;
a scep@@ tic is the endo@@ cr@@ in@@ ologist Claude Marcus of the Kar@@ ol@@ in@@ ska Institute whose work covers the assessment of the biological maturity of people in order to see whether they went sooner or later than usually by pu@@ ber@@ ty .
I had reason to think about it and I don &apos;t think the type of measurement should be used .
assessing the biological age in this way is very uns@@ af@@ e .
&quot; if we cannot say it safe , we shouldn &apos;t do as if we could , &quot; &quot; he said to the Metro . &quot;
&quot; Gö@@ ran@@ sson of the For@@ en@@ sic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : &quot; in general , you can say that the risk to judge a child as an adult is low . &quot;
&quot; the biggest risk is when the person is under 18 , in this case this is about 10 percent . &quot;
full in the plan
the works on the three bridges of Land@@ straße 108 between Lau@@ ter@@ bach and Sch@@ ram@@ berg are progres@@ sing well .
&quot; on Wednesday , a seven @-@ ton concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; we are very good at the time , it &apos;s going great , &quot; says Rein@@ hold Lei@@ cht , Head of Operations at the Department of Traffic and Traffic in the Government Pres@@ i@@ dium of Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; in April , works began at the same time on all three refurb@@ ishment @-@ needy bridges between Sch@@ ram@@ berg and Lau@@ ter@@ bach . &quot;
the building is planned for October and Lei@@ cht is confident that the schedule is comp@@ lied with .
&quot; the first bridge , coming from Sch@@ ram@@ berg , leads over the Tro@@ mb@@ ach . &quot;
&quot; it is a v@@ aul@@ ted arch bridge made of concrete , covered with red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein and has a total length of 4.@@ 80 meters . &quot;
it was built in 1900 .
&quot; like the two other bridges , it has now come into the years . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly renovated . &quot;
the two other bridges take over the Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
they are made of red Bun@@ ts@@ and@@ stein .
&quot; both were built in 1939 and are twelve , respectively 10,@@ 60 metres long . &quot;
the bridge at the entrance of Lau@@ ter@@ bach was now on Wednesday morning on the north side a 1.@@ 30 meter wide and seven tons heavy so @-@ called bridge cap .
&quot; this is a marginal attachment , which is also used as a run@@ way . &quot;
on Friday a 2.@@ 20 meter wide bridge cap is to be used on the southern part of the bridge .
then the pedestrian route is to go .
&quot; the special thing is that it is finished parts , a patent from the Sch@@ ram@@ berger company Di@@ zw@@ o . &quot;
the other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge cap .
particular t@@ act sensitivity has required laying of cables through the building in Lau@@ ter@@ bach .
&quot; there is also a fibre @-@ optic cable , where many companies are connected . &quot;
&quot; prior to the work , local residents were informed about the project . &quot;
&quot; in addition , first fish and cru@@ stac@@ e@@ ans had to be f@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; for the bridges between the building yard and the collective farm towards Sch@@ ram@@ berg , traffic is arranged in one lane by a traffic light . &quot;
&quot; for the construction work on the bridge at the Lau@@ ter@@ bach village entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotel &quot; Tann@@ enhof &quot; and &quot; Seven Lin@@ den &quot; is fully blocked . &quot;
&quot; the cost of the three bridges is 700 000 Euros . &quot;
the whole is financed through the country .
Af@@ D in Ger@@ ol@@ stein : b@@ unter protest with German potato salad
&quot; it doesn &apos;t happen so often that parties pull on one strand , but when it comes to the Alternative for Germany ( Af@@ D ) , it comes together , which is hard to put under a hat . &quot;
&quot; the parties represented in the volcanic Eifel ( CD@@ U , SPD , Grün@@ e , F@@ DP , F@@ WG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag this day because the Af@@ D in the Ger@@ ol@@ st@@ einer Stadthalle invites R@@ ond@@ ell according to the poster &quot; &quot; big election campaign &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known names to the start - like Alice Wei@@ del , which together with Alexander Gau@@ land will be the leading duo for the German Bundestag election on 24 September , and the deputy chair@@ person Beat@@ rix von Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; but those who are on site already hours before the start of the event , do not want to listen to the Af@@ D artists , but demonstrate . &quot;
the motto &quot; The Eifel remains colorful . &quot;
&quot; the town @-@ picnic was originally planned under the motto &quot; All at a table &quot; on the well square , but is now taking place on the parking place below the R@@ ond@@ ells - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the Af@@ D event in the Stadthalle . &quot;
a colorful picture that offers itself .
&quot; and what Christ@@ a Kar@@ oli , chairman of the forum A world and one of the leading organizers , is really happy : &quot; great how many people came together here . &quot;
&quot; there is music and lots of food , including a &quot; &quot; ur@@ German potato salad , which could also eat the Af@@ D without any problems , &quot; &quot; says the woman who brought him along . &quot;
&quot; the police have ordered many officials to Ger@@ ol@@ stein , showing presence especially at the train station , which is only a few meters away from the venues . &quot;
how did the Af@@ D actually come to Ger@@ ol@@ stein ?
Mario Hom@@ pes from the Af@@ D vul@@ can@@ ic Eifel reports that he tried for such an event and received the supplement .
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old from G@@ ön@@ ner@@ sdorf was in demand first in Dau@@ n , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Lau@@ r@@ enti@@ us church there were not enough parking spaces available . &quot;
&quot; so the R@@ ond@@ ell , Hom@@ pes is pleased that &quot; we can have such a nice event here . &quot; &quot;
&quot; he says : &quot; &quot; this is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful . &quot;
&quot; it also does : at 8 p.m. a band provides entertainment , in the Stadthalle several speakers , among them the Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Af@@ D @-@ chairman Uwe Junge . &quot;
&quot; there are about 200 listeners in the hall who are waiting for the leading candidate for the parliamentary election , Alice Wei@@ del , and the Deputy Federal President Beat@@ rix of Stor@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; the police presence remained unchanged , but so far the officials had a quiet evening . &quot;
&quot; a little more than an hour , the Af@@ D event , the guests on the forec@@ our@@ t have a longer breath , but also there is announced shortly after 21 o &apos;clock . &quot;
the police can disman@@ tle - no special incidents .
tro@@ mb@@ one meets trumpet
&quot; a re@@ union with the Wolf@@ acher Pos@@ a@@ uni@@ sten Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is available in the series Has@@ la@@ cher &apos;s mon@@ astic concerts tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 pm in the monastery church . &quot;
&quot; together with the Bulgarian trumpet Mi@@ ros@@ lav Pet@@ kov , he gives a concert under the motto &quot; Black Sea meets Black Forest , &quot; or &quot; Balkan folklore &quot; meets a classical German education with roots in brass music . &quot;
both solo@@ ists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in European top orchest@@ ras .
thus Pet@@ kov Sol@@ ot@@ ro@@ mp@@ eter is the renowned Concer@@ t@@ geb@@ ou@@ w Orchestra Amsterdam and Freder@@ ic B@@ elli is solo trump@@ eter of the SW@@ R Symphony Orchestra .
&quot; both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres . &quot;
&quot; Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new gu@@ ise , Daniel Schn@@ y@@ der &apos;s &quot; world music &quot; unites themselves with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece &quot; Exchange Suite &quot; of the jazz pianist N@@ ils W@@ ogram , classical , jazz and free play blend into a fascinating complete work of art . &quot;
this cent@@ re@@ piece of the program was first performed in Freiburg this spring .
the renowned composer N@@ ils W@@ ogram made it especially written for the two musicians and more : the Has@@ la@@ cher Klo@@ sterk@@ irche with its special acoustics is consciously integrated into the concert .
Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart talks about their bis@@ exu@@ ality
&quot; some people love grilled cheese and will eat it until the end of their lives .
&quot; but I want to try everything , &quot; &quot; said Kri@@ sten Ste@@ wart openly about their bis@@ exu@@ ality . &quot;
&quot; once I bite into grilled cheeses , I think : &apos; Oh that was cool , what comes next ? &apos; . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known relationship of Hollywood stars was that of her &quot; T@@ wi@@ light &quot; colleague Robert P@@ att@@ inson , who eventually dealt bit@@ terly . &quot;
&quot; despite all this , the brun@@ ette Dar@@ stell@@ erin is insured against the &quot; Har@@ per &apos;s Ba@@ z@@ aar &quot; magazine : &quot; I was in love with everyone I &apos;ve ever dre@@ amt of . &quot;
&quot; or do you think , I would have played it ? &quot;
&quot; after her separation , Kri@@ sten had admitted that she was bis@@ exual : &quot; I have always lived du@@ alism and believed in it seriously . &quot;
so it has never confused or hin@@ dered me .
&quot; I never liked it , not to be taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; she especially suffered under &quot; &quot; B@@ ang Show@@ bi@@ z &quot; , &quot; but at school time , when she preferred to dress like a boy , &quot; &quot; not all girls are typical girls . &quot;
this really hurt me .
&quot; when I was eleven , the children told me , I would look like a boy . &quot;
&quot; I really felt attacked , frigh@@ tened and ashamed . &quot;
&quot; now I look back and think : &apos; girl , be proud of you ! &apos; . &quot;
especially the public don &apos;t like to explain their love life : &quot; people expect you to be in a certain way and that anno@@ ys me .
&quot; and perhaps some call me ung@@ rat@@ eful , but I don &apos;t like to justify myself in front of the whole public . &quot;
West Virginia Gover@@ nor announces that he changes the party
&quot; the Democratic governor of West Virginia , Jim Justice , announced Thursday evening with President Tru@@ mp that he will change the party . &quot;
&quot; whether you like it or not , the demo@@ crats have removed from me , &quot; said Gover@@ nor Justice . &quot;
&quot; today I will tell you with many prayers and a lot of thinking ... Today I will tell you as a resident of West Virginia , I can no longer help you if I am a democratic governor . &quot;
the rally broke out in jubil@@ ation .
&quot; tomorrow I will change my registration to the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , &quot; Justice added . &quot;
&quot; as a trainer , I would say that it &apos;s time to play another game . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp promised before a big announcement at the West Virginia rally .
Mr. Tru@@ mp won West Virginia with 42 points and Justice did not endor@@ se the democratic candidate H@@ illary Clinton .
&quot; Justice , who is the only billi@@ on@@ aire in the state according to For@@ bes , was elected in 2016 . &quot;
For@@ bes states that he has coal mines in five states and inherited a coal market from his father .
it is worth about 1.@@ 59 billion dollars .
&quot; in the meantime , the Republi@@ can National Committee issued an explanation on Thursday evening in which it said : &quot; the party change by Gover@@ nor Justice is another blow to a Democratic party that would prevent us from working as it would work to make our country great . &quot;
&quot; with only 15 provinces and the control of the least legislative bodies in history , the announcement by Gover@@ nor Justice is only the last rejection of a party which is from top to bottom without leadership and is not able to find a positive , uni@@ fying message , &quot; &quot; said the R@@ NC chairman Ron@@ na Mc@@ Daniel in an explanation of the C@@ BS News . &quot;
&quot; Co@@ E pra@@ ises &quot; &quot; honest &quot; &quot; Russian ap@@ ology for dop@@ ing sc@@ andal &quot;
&quot; the global leader of athle@@ tics , Sebastian Co@@ e , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a dop@@ ing sc@@ andal , but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resum@@ ed into the sport . &quot;
Russian athle@@ tics boss D@@ mit@@ ry S@@ hy@@ la@@ k@@ h@@ tin said during IA@@ AF con@@ gresses on the eve of the World Ath@@ le@@ tics Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight the dop@@ ing .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m sorry for &quot; &quot; all the athletes who were gra@@ bbed gold and silver medals at competitions . &quot;
&quot; despite its comments , the IA@@ AF congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) had found evidence on state @-@ sponsored dop@@ ing in Russia . &quot;
&quot; I thought it was a very open response today , a very honest presentation , &quot; &quot; said IA@@ AF President Co@@ e to the re@@ porters . &quot;
the entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re@@ designed .
Co@@ E said he was also &quot; pleased &quot; that Russia accepted the criteria for its re @-@ establishment .
&quot; I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re @-@ use Russia again , &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
we have to do everything in the coming months to norm@@ alize this situation .
&quot; the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; ninet@@ een Russian athletes will compete in the athle@@ tics world champi@@ onships , which begin on Friday in London , according to the strict IA@@ AF criteria as neutral actors . &quot;
&quot; the head of IA@@ AF @-@ Task Force , R@@ une Ander@@ sen , said on Monday that Russia must still fulfill some of the criteria for a re @-@ adjustment . &quot;
&quot; although drug tests are still inadequate and banned coaches are still free , he re@@ port@@ edly told re@@ porters in London after a lecture at IA@@ AF Council . &quot;
&quot; funeral p@@ act for soldiers cancelled in Mali , &quot;
&quot; during a funeral service in the nor@@ h@@ ess@@ ische Frit@@ z@@ lar , about 1000 people of the two soldiers were thinking about a helicopter crash in Mali . &quot;
the ceremony took place on Thursday in the cathedral city under high security measures .
&quot; to the un@@ explained crash , Secretary of Defense Ursula von der Le@@ yen ( CD@@ U ) said nothing . &quot;
&quot; she described the two opposite drivers , however , as the &quot; cor@@ onation of their profession . &quot; &quot;
&quot; we bow down to the highest sacrifice they have provided in the name of the Federal Republic of Germany , &quot; &quot; she explained . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Major and the 47 @-@ year @-@ old Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann from Nord@@ h@@ essen had died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .
their coff@@ ins were transferred to Germany and on Thursday accompanied by a vi@@ gil of the Bundes@@ wehr into the Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er Dom Sankt Peter .
&quot; at noon , only the relatives of the church took leave . &quot;
&quot; then the funeral service began in the circle of the family , the closest friends , the representatives of the Bundes@@ wehr and the politics . &quot;
among these were H@@ ess@@ ens Prime Minister Volker Bou@@ ff@@ ier ( CD@@ U ) and the chief inspec@@ tor of the Bundes@@ wehr Volker Wi@@ ek@@ er .
&quot; the sor@@ cer@@ ers laid down roses , the members stood arm in arm at the coff@@ ins . &quot;
&quot; in front of the church , Frit@@ z@@ lar@@ er and numerous soldiers persecuted the ceremony on a screen . &quot;
&quot; Minister of Defence of Le@@ yen called the in@@ verse soldiers as &quot; &quot; highly decorated &quot; &quot; and sm@@ ashed . &quot;
the Stab@@ sh@@ aup@@ t@@ mann had built the flight operations of the helicopter Tiger in Frit@@ z@@ lar and was one of the first six trained tiger drivers of his regi@@ ment .
&quot; Volker Bau@@ ers@@ ach@@ s , commander of the regi@@ ment to which the soldiers were , said : &quot; if this crew could not turn down the crash , nobody would have liked it . &quot;
&quot; doubts about the UN Mission in Mali , Minister of Le@@ yen , did not show that the deployment was dangerous . &quot;
&quot; but he is also of high significance &quot; for a country from which we are separated only by two states , &quot; she said . &quot;
after the funeral service the coff@@ ins were taken out of the cathedral .
&quot; when and where to be buried , the Bundes@@ wehr did not provide any information . &quot;
Prince Hen@@ rik does not want a grave next to his wife
&quot; the man of the Danish Queen Mar@@ gre@@ the ( 77 ) , Prince Hen@@ rik ( 83 ) , will not be buried next to his wife after his death . &quot;
that shared the royal house on Thursday .
&quot; traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Ros@@ kil@@ de . &quot;
the sculptor Bj@@ ør@@ n N@@ ør@@ ga@@ ard already made a sar@@ cop@@ hag@@ us for the two .
the Queen agreed with her husband &apos;s decision .
where Prince Hen@@ rik is buried is still unclear .
but he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .
Prince Hen@@ rik had never made a secret that he was not happy with his title .
&quot; after the accession of his wife Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1972 , he would have liked to become king . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , he retired and also covers the title &quot; &quot; Prince &apos;s Su@@ pper &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as Hen@@ rik did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see himself as equal to his wife - not after death , L@@ ene B@@ alle@@ by , the chief speaker of the Danish royal house . &quot;
&quot; where the last resting place of the 83 @-@ year @-@ old will eventually be , be still unclear . &quot;
&quot; but he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark . &quot;
he likes the country he has worked for over the last 50 years .
&quot; born in 1965 in London , Henri de Labor@@ de de Mon@@ pe@@ z@@ at , son of a French aristo@@ cratic family , met Mar@@ gre@@ the in 1965 . &quot;
&quot; on the Th@@ ames , he worked in the French embassy . &quot;
&quot; during his later wife , the sympath@@ ies of the people were always inter@@ tw@@ ined , Prince Hen@@ rik had a heavy standing at the Dan@@ es during his 50 @-@ year reign . &quot;
&quot; in an auto@@ biography , Hen@@ rik said about the first years in Denmark : &quot; a few months after my arrival , everything I did was critic@@ ised . &quot;
&quot; my Danish was wa@@ vering , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stock@@ ings instead of kn@@ itting so@@ cks , Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football . &quot;
&quot; even for the Gau@@ l@@ ises , which I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of corporate critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indul@@ gence . &quot;
I was different .
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed .
these were two mistakes ! &quot;
Prime Minister Wei@@ l wants fast re @-@ election
CD@@ U and F@@ DP in the presence of potential majority in Lower Saxony
&quot; after the loss of the red @-@ green government majority for a rapid re @-@ election of the Parliament , Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) is not willing to res@@ ign . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , he spoke out for the resolution of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Gre@@ ens from their state parliament in Lower Saxony had over@@ thrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) into a serious crisis . &quot;
&quot; five months before the official date of the Parliament elections , the red @-@ green coalition in Hanover lost its scar@@ ce one @-@ voice majority in parliament to the opposition from the CD@@ U and the F@@ DP . &quot;
the previous Green MP El@@ ke T@@ ables founded her step with the non @-@ nom@@ ination for the election of 2018 in her constitu@@ ency in Rot@@ enburg ( Wü@@ mme ) .
&quot; I see my political future in the CD@@ U , &quot; she stated on Friday in Hanover . &quot;
CD@@ U Group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend its Group to record it .
&quot; with this , CD@@ U and F@@ DP had 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land@@ tag , SPD and Green 68 seats . &quot;
so far the ratio was revers@@ ed .
the new Land@@ tag is scheduled for the 14th of January next year .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler said that the red @-@ green provincial government should now decide whether to go@@ vern in this situation without a majority .
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , however , considers it indispensable that the Land@@ tag decides as quickly as possible its self @-@ resolution . &quot;
the CD@@ U Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .
the state constitution also fores@@ ees the possibility that the country &apos;s day depri@@ ves the Prime Minister and el@@ ects a successor .
&quot; &quot; &quot; our constitution offers several options . &quot;
&quot; these possibilities must be legally audi@@ ted , &quot; &quot; said Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler . &quot;
all questions will be addressed in peace if they are legally audi@@ ted .
Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler called T@@ nurse &apos;s step &quot; but something strange . &quot;
the politi@@ cian himself stressed : &quot; I am not a tra@@ itor .
I feel very good . &quot;
she described herself as a wear@@ er of black @-@ green .
the Gre@@ ens called for the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ arians to return their country &apos;s mandate .
&quot; we , of course , assume that they have received their land mandate , which they have received through the green national list , with immediate effect , &quot; &quot; said the President Met@@ a Jan@@ ssen @-@ Ku@@ cz and Stefan Kör@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; the Group leader of the Green Anja P@@ iel , said : &quot; &quot; we regret the decision by El@@ ke T@@ west extraordinarily . &quot;
she deliberately chose not to engage in the faction .
&quot; even before the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot comprehend this step . &quot;
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condem@@ ns the transfer of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens El@@ ke T@@ wins to the CD@@ U as a betra@@ yal .
&quot; the attitude of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betra@@ yal of the elec@@ torate , but also betra@@ yal of red @-@ green , &quot; &quot; wrote the Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook . &quot;
he supported the decision of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) to quickly elect the Land@@ tag .
the exit of T@@ west costs the majority of red @-@ green in Lower Saxony .
&quot; in her latest vanity and fru@@ stration she puts her personal interests before the well @-@ being of the country , &quot; critic@@ ised SPD Secretary General Hu@@ ber@@ tus Heil . &quot;
it is sc@@ andal@@ ous that the CD@@ U in Lower Saxony uses this dirty intri@@ gue and tries to make political capital out of it .
Nieder@@ sachsen &apos;s CD@@ U group leader Bj@@ örn Th@@ ü@@ m@@ ler wants to recommend his de@@ pu@@ ties to record El@@ ke T@@ jackets into the CD@@ U .
&quot; the SPD leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , proposed to fal@@ si@@ fy the results of the 2013 Parliament election with personal careers . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U was the strongest force at that time in front of the SPD , but SPD and Gre@@ ens had a very thin majority in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; interview - How do we protect ourselves from gyp@@ si@@ es , Mr. Schmidt ? &quot;
Germany discusses about contaminated eggs .
how could the sc@@ andal happen ?
how can consumers protect themselves .
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CS@@ U ) is talking and answering in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) .
&quot; Mr. Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from pois@@ oned eggs ? &quot;
I can only encourage all consumers to look at the eggs in your fridge and check the stamp pressure .
&quot; on the consumer protection portal www.@@ foodstuffs war@@ n@@ ung@@ .de , the federal states provide the latest information on the affected eggs @-@ char@@ ms . &quot;
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .
&quot; even if after all that we know at present , a health hazard is virtually eliminated . &quot;
does Al@@ di now take over the best possible crisis reaction - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the clari@@ fier is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?
food monitoring is the task of the federal states .
&quot; nevertheless , my house has immediately switched off and has since become aware of the sad@@ ness of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries . &quot;
all information and risk assessment are available for consumers .
trade has the same concern as manufacturers to ensure that the sold products are market@@ able and harmless to health .
&quot; if you exceed 0,@@ 00@@ 5@@ mg / kg in eggs , these are not market@@ able . &quot;
&quot; however , un@@ loaded eggs can be sold and consumed . &quot;
this time the factories are not to blame .
are manufacturing companies and consumers in the same boat ?
&quot; according to the state of knowledge , the production companies are not directly responsible . &quot;
&quot; rather , they must expect economic damage based on the alleged illegal practices of service companies . &quot;
&quot; as always , there are too few controllers in the case of harvest . &quot;
is it only lacking in the staff or on conclu@@ sive jurisdiction ?
it was just the official controls that have revealed the process .
&quot; the truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 percent excluded . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , a consequ@@ ent clari@@ fication of such events and the transfer to the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in cases where criminal off@@ ences can be present are of decisive importance . &quot;
I have already made it clear several times that I expect a complete explanation from the responsible authorities .
is regular alarm for food sc@@ and@@ als really necessary ?
consumers have the right to only get safe and market@@ able foodstuffs .
&quot; if a non @-@ approved insec@@ ti@@ cide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indign@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; as a result of the pan@@ de@@ mic means , manufacturers , retailers and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary . &quot;
&quot; basically , it must be clear : the illegal use of the insec@@ ti@@ cide Fi@@ pron@@ il in the attitude of food @-@ supplying animals is unacceptable and must be terminated immediately . &quot;
this has to be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .
I expect from all competent authorities that the facts are quickly and completely clari@@ fied .
how the Football Fis@@ cal Rules affect N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to Paris
the rules aimed at preventing un@@ hin@@ dered expendi@@ tures of European football clubs will not distur@@ b N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris @-@ Saint Ger@@ main .
&quot; any consequences will be made for Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main of UEF@@ A , as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to prohi@@ bit teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament . &quot;
&quot; financial Fair Play rules , launched in 2011 by the UEF@@ A , mean that PS@@ G will have to prove at some point that the transfer from N@@ ey@@ mar was funded with no major losses . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona has paid 2@@ 22 million euros ( 26@@ 2 million dollars ) to get the Brazilian out of its contract , and N@@ ey@@ mar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year . &quot;
here are some of the financial aspects of N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s move to France .
PS@@ G can surely make the money loose so that N@@ ey@@ mar under@@ writes and bring it into a gal@@ axy of other stars in the face of the financing of the team by the power of the rich lord of Qatar .
&quot; clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but have to counter@@ act legitimate obj@@ ections that allow them to break the break even point in their business @-@ related business . &quot;
&quot; FF@@ P was designed by Michel Plat@@ ini in 2007 , following his election as the UEF@@ A President . &quot;
&quot; the former French player believed that clubs who had huge debts in their quest for success were effectively che@@ ating and ris@@ king to ruin themselves , when banks or owners with@@ drew their support . &quot;
&quot; in 2011 , FF@@ P shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses . &quot;
&quot; the change meant that the business model , which Roman Abra@@ movi@@ ch used in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue . &quot;
&quot; during the current three @-@ year period of FF@@ P , which runs until 2018 , clubs can take losses of 30 million euros . &quot;
&quot; although Plat@@ ini has fallen from the Pres@@ i@@ dency of the Pres@@ i@@ dency in 2015 , his successor , Ale@@ ks@@ ander C@@ efer@@ in , will continue to dis@@ courage from excessive spending . &quot;
&quot; surely FF@@ P is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future , &quot; &quot; said Andrea Tra@@ ver@@ so , who is responsible for the UEF@@ A for FF@@ P , compared to The Associ@@ ated Press last week . &quot;
&quot; although PS@@ G paid the buy @-@ out clause of N@@ ey@@ mar in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ey@@ mar has signed a five @-@ year contract , so that the sales revenue can be reported for the next five years amounting to EUR 4@@ 4.4 million in the annual financial statements . &quot;
&quot; the first wave of FF@@ P sanctions in 2014 brought the PS@@ G together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , with the he@@ avi@@ est sanctions . &quot;
&quot; PS@@ G received a fine of 60 million euros ( at that time 82 million dollars ) , which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players . &quot;
UEF@@ A is looking for clubs that could try to over@@ lay their financial supervision by infl@@ ating their revenue by companies connected to the owners of a club .
&quot; while a kat@@ ar@@ gic company could sponsor the PS@@ G if the value of sponsor@@ ing should exceed the standard market rates , UEF@@ A would not be regarded as legitimate income . &quot;
this happened in 2014 when the UEF@@ A decided that the value of sponsor@@ ing the P@@ SA was infl@@ ated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .
it was reported that part of the PS@@ G payments to N@@ ey@@ mar could come about payments from the Organ@@ izing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar .
but PS@@ G and Qatar 2022 have denied that N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s World Cup ambass@@ adors will be able to figure out such maneu@@ ver for UEF@@ A regul@@ ators .
the previous sanctions against PS@@ G mean that UEF@@ A will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to b@@ ypass the rules .
&quot; UEF@@ A had no prepar@@ atory talks with PS@@ G on N@@ ey@@ mar@@ s Transfer , on Thursday the people who were familiar with the situation . &quot;
they spoke on the condition of anonym@@ ity with The Associ@@ ated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PS@@ G situation .
the latest published reports show that PS@@ G 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than € 10 million with a turnover of € 54@@ 2.4 million .
the accounts for the last financial year must still be published .
&quot; PS@@ G expects N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s arrival to be a blessing for sponsor@@ ing deals , merchan@@ dising and tri@@ cot sales . &quot;
the association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .
&quot; the Spanish League was clearly irrit@@ ated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent N@@ ey@@ mar &apos;s way by claiming that PS@@ G would violate the FF@@ P . &quot;
&quot; it is a clear case of &quot; financial dop@@ ing &quot; with the club and the state , &quot; said the president of La League , J@@ avier T@@ eb@@ as , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kat@@ ar &apos;s final ownership on PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal @-@ Manager Ar@@ sene Wen@@ ger , whose association is owned by an American sport @-@ ty@@ co@@ ons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association . &quot;
&quot; it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , &quot; said Wen@@ ger on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; as soon as a country owns a society , everything is possible . &quot;
&quot; it is very difficult to respect the financial fair , because one can have different ways or have different interests if a country has such a great actor to represent a country . &quot;
Swiss is looking for a new creator supplier
&quot; over the past few years , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y has manufactured board chocolate for Swiss . &quot;
now the sweet co @-@ operation is at a possible end : the airline writes the order again .
&quot; Swiss @-@ spokes@@ woman Mei@@ ke Fu@@ hl@@ rot@@ t confirmed a report of the newspaper &quot; &quot; Nord@@ west@@ schweiz &quot; &quot; on Friday . &quot;
&quot; according to current planning , the airline will complete a new contract in the first half of 2018 . &quot;
the products would be checked every two or three years and subjected to quality control .
&quot; we are very satisfied with the current supplier Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y , &quot; said the spokesperson . &quot;
around 17 million small red @-@ white plastic bags packaged to 14 grams per year before landing on passengers .
Swiss Life did not want to provide any information about the cost .
&quot; industry insi@@ der estimates the volume of orders according to &quot; &quot; Nor@@ th@@ western Switzerland &quot; &quot; at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Mig@@ ros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs . &quot;
but more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a shock maker .
Swiss will not be able to betra@@ y how many applicants exist in the new call for ten@@ ders .
&quot; in question , however , only Swiss manufacturers are concerned . &quot;
&quot; according to the newspaper report , Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y will endeav@@ our to rev@@ ise the contract beyond the Spring of 2018 . &quot;
&quot; for the s@@ da , the biggest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for a statement . &quot;
chocolate boards distributed the Swiss since 2006 on board their flights .
&quot; before the Swiss signed a contract with the Mig@@ ros subsidiary , Barry C@@ alle@@ baut , in collaboration with Hu@@ g , delivered the chocolate tablets . &quot;
Swiss Life took the opportunity to place the logo two and a half years ago with Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y .
the airline is working with different Swiss chocolate producers .
&quot; on long @-@ haul flights , the customers of the First Class are spoiled with treats from the Spr@@ ün@@ gli Con@@ fis@@ erie , in Business Class , passengers Scho@@ gg@@ i from Lind@@ t and in Economy Class Scho@@ gg@@ i of Cho@@ col@@ at Fre@@ y . &quot;

&quot; his brother Christoph , Olympic Champion of 2016 , had failed in the national championship election and could only look at the disc@@ us competition from the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
&quot; also with the first attempt , the Polish title defender Pi@@ ot@@ r Mal@@ ach@@ owski , who designed 6@@ 5,@@ 13 metres , qualified for the final battle . &quot;
nostal@@ gia goes into &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; and &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; into the niche
&quot; this repetition of history is also nostal@@ gic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90 @-@ year Gr@@ unge era ( as the think@@ ers David W@@ ain and Michael Show@@ alter the Sk@@ etch comedy &quot; The State &quot; for M@@ TV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth B@@ anks , A@@ my Po@@ eh@@ ler and Paul Ru@@ dd , went to greater things . &quot;
&quot; as a cultural arti@@ fact , it is equally a par@@ o@@ dy and em@@ bodi@@ ment of our Facebook @-@ capable era of permanent memories . &quot;
but as fran@@ chise it feels like time is scar@@ ce .
&quot; first Day of Camp &quot; worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd Hum@@ ors ( it contained an original story for a talking sweet vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) . &quot;
&quot; by getting up at the core of the g@@ ags - middle @-@ aged actors play cool children , who will grow up - nevertheless , they managed to regain the last part of the W@@ itz@@ es . &quot;
&quot; ten Years L@@ ater , &quot; with his adults , who now play adults , is less emotion@@ ally rooted and his par@@ o@@ dy goes more after the casting criterion , including a reef on the stal@@ ker films of the 90@@ s like &quot; The Hand That Ro@@ cks the C@@ rad@@ le . &quot; &quot;
&quot; one point pul@@ ls a character through an Apple power@@ book , some inline sk@@ ates and &quot; a number of other things from 1991 . &quot;
many of the central stories are the same .
&quot; the lovely C@@ oop ( Mr. Show@@ alter ) , now Roman@@ au@@ tor , has not forgotten K@@ atie ( Mar@@ guer@@ ite Mor@@ eau ) . &quot;
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has not lost his vir@@ g@@ inity .
there is another crazy @-@ vi@@ cious P@@ lot involved in Ron@@ ald Re@@ agan ( also Mr. Show@@ alter ) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .
&quot; as always , the ex@@ ams are the best part of the fran@@ chise . &quot;
&quot; it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Ru@@ dd , who shows Matt D@@ ill@@ ons &apos;s sub@@ li@@ cking style of &quot; Sing@@ les , &quot; whose former Big @-@ Man @-@ on @-@ Camp Andy feels like an old boy . &quot;
&quot; there are the moments of random ma@@ dness that could hei@@ gh@@ ten this fran@@ chise as a kind of repeti@@ tive &quot; Seven Up ! &quot; series until he reaches what I considered his logical conclusion : &quot; &quot; wet Hot American Summer : Tw@@ enty Years L@@ ater &quot; , &quot; whose last scene will show the movie premiere of &quot; &quot; W@@ et Hot American Summer &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; on Amazon reminds of another type of nostal@@ gia : the revival of the Cold War of &quot; The Americans , &quot; to the film &quot; Atom@@ ic Bl@@ onde , &quot; and even to &quot; G@@ LO@@ W , &quot; with its East @-@ West @-@ West @-@ war icon@@ ography . &quot;
&quot; the comedy with Rh@@ ys Thomas created by Brian Gat@@ ew@@ ood and Alessandro Tan@@ aka : a Romanian drama of the eigh@@ ties with the two polic@@ emen as friends , two officers from Buchar@@ est fighting for truth , a@@ thei@@ sm and the path of Marxism @-@ Len@@ in@@ ism . &quot;
&quot; the main roles - a hard @-@ boiled Gregor and an ide@@ alistic I@@ os@@ ef - are played by Flor@@ in Pier@@ sic J@@ r. and Corn@@ eli@@ u u@@ lic@@ i , whose dialo@@ gues are synchron@@ ised by Ch@@ anning Tat@@ um ( also an exec@@ utable producer ) and Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt in English . &quot;
it is a brilliant idea .
but it is not much more than an idea .
there are some nice g@@ ags to look at ( the police spends the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football ) .
&quot; and the list of famous actors - including J@@ enny S@@ late , Nick Off@@ er@@ man , Mah@@ er@@ sh@@ ala Ali and Ch@@ lo@@ e Se@@ vi@@ gn@@ y - provides a decent game &apos; Find out the voice &apos; . &quot;
but &quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective &quot; is so much engaged in the tru@@ th@@ fulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a mur@@ derer wearing a Re@@ agan &apos;s mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .
&quot; with six long episodes , it withdraw@@ s and the comedy is not fast or frequent . &quot;
&quot; Com@@ rade Det@@ ective , who was re@@ arranged for a lower length , could better deliver his Ag@@ it@@ pro@@ p sati@@ re , since Gregor and I@@ os@@ ef constantly visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who dev@@ our a bunch of ham@@ bur@@ gers . &quot;
the message for the imagined Communist audience is that the Western culture can do everything to feed for money .
the fic@@ ti@@ tious Romanian cre@@ ators were not wrong : we even make it with our own younger history and with theirs .
strike against drug ma@@ fia in the country
the police have succeeded in a strike against the Italian ma@@ fia in Baden @-@ Württemberg .
&quot; on Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest @-@ Ba@@ ar district , in Rot@@ t@@ weil , Constance , Ess@@ lingen and Stuttgart many objects were searched , as the public prosec@@ utor Kon@@ stanz informed on Friday . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , 15 defend@@ ants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years old and issued arrest warran@@ ts against them . &quot;
&quot; the officials also assured large quantities of marijuana and co@@ ca@@ ine , fire@@ arms as well as several hundred thousand euros . &quot;
two people were arrested during the same period of time in Italy .
there were German arrest warran@@ ts against the two susp@@ ects .
the two will probably be extra@@ di@@ ted to Germany .
Italian and Bavarian investig@@ ators were involved in the action .
&quot; in total , more than 300 polic@@ emen were in use . &quot;
&quot; the Ma@@ fia members are accused of organised drug crimin@@ ality , heavy acts of violence , attempted murder , rob@@ ber@@ y and black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2016 , the public prosec@@ utor &apos;s office established consistency against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany . &quot;
between the prosec@@ ut@@ ors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investig@@ ators of the Kri@@ po Rot@@ t@@ weil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .
&quot; therefore , the large @-@ scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo . &quot;
the aim of the investigation was mainly Italian nation@@ als with close relation to the Italian ma@@ fia .
&quot; a incident on May 27 in Hü@@ fingen , where several shots were fired at a restaurant early in the morning , should go to the bank account . &quot;
Weise lam@@ ents large gaps in the ali@@ ens @-@ register
&quot; data from citizens who should not appear &quot; : &quot; according to a report , the foreigners register in Germany shows substantial short@@ com@@ ings . &quot;
this leads to partly serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures .
&quot; according to a media report , the Commissioner responsible for the refugee management of the Federal Government , Frank @-@ Jürgen Weise , pointed to large gaps in the immigration centre register . &quot;
&quot; short@@ com@@ ings in the data recorded there may lead to partly serious mis@@ decisions in the case of asylum procedures and deport@@ ations , in an analysis published by the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
&quot; according to the data , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the register , including 5,@@ 7 million from non @-@ EU countries . &quot;
the data is therefore managed by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany .
&quot; because the data had not been adequately maintained , the quality of data in parts has not been good so far . &quot;
&quot; data from 1921 have been found in individual cases , &quot; &quot; by people who are no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register any more . &quot;
&quot; faulty data input can significantly slow revers@@ al processes , &quot; &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in the statistics on adequate people , moreover , EU citizens are captured who have not had to travel at all . &quot;
&quot; such false orders , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient funds , &quot; according to the analysis . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families back to Italy with 16 @-@ year @-@ old children when they came from there . &quot;
&quot; this comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refu@@ ge@@ es ( BA@@ MF ) , reports the &quot; Neue O@@ sn@@ ab@@ rück Zeitung . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the paper it is said that the &quot; &quot; BA@@ MF lead &quot; &quot; such procedures &quot; &quot; concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and small children - after Italy since 1 June 2017 . &quot;
&quot; since the end of 2014 , this was virtually no longer possible , so the newspaper was referring to the difficult situation on the spot . &quot;
&quot; after the Dublin agreement , refugees from the EU state are in charge of reaching it first . &quot;
&quot; if a migrant is travelling to another EU country , this state can return it to the immig@@ rant country . &quot;
&quot; the office now writes : &quot; &quot; in the meantime , the capacity for families with minor children in Italy has significantly increased . &quot;
Italy provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .
even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECH@@ R ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .
other EU states would also send refugees back to the Dublin agreement .
&quot; the internal political spokes@@ woman of the left @-@ wing group in the Bundestag , U@@ lla Yel@@ ts@@ ke , critic@@ ised this decision : &quot; families with children are threatened with un@@ lawful reception conditions and a threat to child welfare because of the short@@ com@@ ings in the Italian asylum system . &quot;
second best result achieved
&quot; in a total of 220 liters of blood from people living in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach , the blood donation service has already been available to other people . &quot;
at least among the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday .
&quot; Jürgen Gre@@ ens , who now divided up to 100 liters of blood with his 100 donations . &quot;
&quot; traditionally , in the session of the Municipal Council , the congregation acknow@@ le@@ dges the multiple readiness to don@@ ate blood . &quot;
&quot; it is ingeni@@ ous how our body is created for it and we pay tribute to the don@@ ors who make their blood available to strangers , yet un@@ sel@@ fish , &quot; under@@ lined mayor Karl@@ h@@ ein@@ z K@@ ist@@ ner . &quot;
&quot; a single blood donation helps several people , &quot; explained the District Director of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Mais@@ enb@@ acher , because the cann@@ ed are de@@ composed into their components . &quot;
three people could already benefit from a blood donation .
&quot; at the same time , corn cre@@ ators reported on the actions carried out in the spring in Ober@@ rei@@ chen@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; this year , we achieved the second best result with 114 don@@ ors , &quot; &quot; said the D@@ CC district manager . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the change to the theatre has led to higher numbers of participants a few years ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , Thomas Bo@@ ck@@ stadt , Susanne Reich@@ le , Sandra Schö@@ ck , Thomas Reich@@ le and Met@@ a Stra@@ w@@ berry were among the maj@@ ors and were awarded for 50 per cent donated blood donations . &quot;
&quot; half so many book Herbert M@@ air and Dor@@ othe@@ e Ri@@ ex@@ inger , while Tam@@ ara Pier@@ rom@@ mer , Petra Schle@@ eh , Stef@@ anie St@@ oll and Uwe Vet@@ ter gave ten times each 500 milli@@ liter of their life juice . &quot;
the Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.@@ 25 %
&quot; the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and weak@@ ening inflation have damp@@ ened speculation about an increase . &quot;
the Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain slu@@ gg@@ ish when it kept interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure .
&quot; the Bank &apos;s political decision @-@ makers voted with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % , whereas in this month fewer members were reluct@@ ant to increase as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase . &quot;
&quot; in its quar@@ terly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7 % and rose to 1.6 % for 2018 and warned that the pressure on domestic revenues would continue to rise to just under 3 % in autumn . &quot;
&quot; but it sign@@ alized that in the next few years , interest increases would be necessary to cur@@ b the inflation heated by the Bre@@ x@@ it , and it said that lending costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mam@@ mot@@ h economic stimulus package , issued a year after the Bre@@ x@@ it . &quot;
&quot; it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February , even though it was said that it is now expected to make 15 billion pounds available within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds ster@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; after deciding on the interest rate , the Bank said : &quot; in the central pro@@ g@@ nosis of the M@@ PC , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households still bur@@ dened the consumption . &quot;
&quot; at the interest rates , it reiter@@ ated that &quot; a certain tigh@@ tening of monetary policy &quot; would be needed to cool inflation and a &quot; greater &quot; scale than the markets expect . &quot;
the markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .
&quot; the Bank emphas@@ ised however that increases would be &quot; &quot; gradual &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; limited &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Bank &apos;s growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .
it maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .
the Po@@ und fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .
the pound dropped by 0.5 % to 1.@@ 31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4 % to 1.@@ 11 euros .
&quot; the decision to no change comes after the recent dis@@ ap@@ pointing growth figures damp@@ ened the rising expectations of interest rate , and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months has risen to 0.3 % . &quot;
&quot; growth will likely be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the Bank at the end of the year . &quot;
&quot; the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal remuneration , as the sharpen@@ ing is getting worse first before it gets better . &quot;
&quot; she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot &quot; &quot; prevent &quot; &quot; in@@ comes &quot; , &quot; but she added that the wages at the end of her three year forecast can be &quot; &quot; clear &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods , which is attributable to the weak pound , which will compensate for a portion of the lower consumption expenditure . &quot;
&quot; the decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.@@ 25 % last August following the sho@@ cking EU vote , which caused the sin@@ king of the p@@ act . &quot;
the Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy .
&quot; before the Bank &apos;s final verdict on interest rates , the call for interest rate increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard @-@ pressed households , with three polic@@ y@@ makers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July . &quot;
&quot; inflation in the past month fell from 2.@@ 9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the bank said it was expected to attract it again in the coming months . &quot;
the Bank said that the excess in proportion to its target of 2 % was &quot; quite &quot; attributable to the weak pound .
&quot; Andrew Mont@@ lake , director of Cor@@ eco Mort@@ gage Bro@@ kers , said : &quot; in view of the recent swap rates , the mort@@ gage market is likely to become more competitive again , as the credi@@ tors are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way . &quot;
&quot; the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mort@@ g@@ ages complete , and many with toll @-@ free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . &quot;
N@@ HS ( National Health Service ) urged to prescri@@ be the controversial HIV drug of 10.000 people
patients will receive access to a &quot; transform@@ ative &quot; HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight against the High Court against financing the drug in the N@@ HS .
&quot; N@@ HS England announced that pre @-@ sex pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high @-@ risk patients by around 86 percent , is now delivered by the health service via a first three @-@ year study for estimated 10,000 people . &quot;
&quot; he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appe@@ al confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year , according to which the N@@ HS had the authority to pay for the pre@@ p in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance it . &quot;
&quot; announced on Thursday , N@@ HS England CEO Simon St@@ ev@@ ens was welcomed as an &quot; &quot; important new intervention &quot; , &quot; while the National AIDS Trust ( NA@@ T ) described this as a &quot; decisive moment . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual health clinics in London , Bri@@ gh@@ ton , Manchester , Liverpool and She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d will be among the first to enable people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 . &quot;
pre@@ exposure proph@@ yla@@ xis ( pre@@ p ) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .
studies have shown that pre@@ p significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection risk .
taking pre@@ p before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection .
such medicines may be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse .
&quot; those who come into question for the treatment include gay or bis@@ exual men , trans@@ sexual and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated . &quot;
&quot; suitable candidates are identified in clinics who agree to the study , including men , women , trans@@ gen@@ ders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti@@ retro@@ viral treatment . &quot;
individuals who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also opt @-@ in for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .
the program is subscri@@ bed to £ 10 million and N@@ HS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .
&quot; the study aims to assess the entire pre@@ p potential by collecting clinical evidence , as used in a large scale , and implemented . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens said : &quot; this great new intervention should supplement and over@@ take the far @-@ reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .
it is another milestone in the progress lasting more than three decades in cop@@ ing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . &quot;
&quot; Deb@@ or@@ ah Gold , Chief Executive at NA@@ T ( National AIDS Trust ) said : &quot; &quot; this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV . &quot;
&quot; pre@@ p , aimed specifically in vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epide@@ mic . &quot;
&quot; from September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this N@@ HS @-@ funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives . &quot;
we warmly welcome this announcement . &quot;
&quot; Ian Green , CEO of the Terr@@ ence H@@ ig@@ gins Trust , said : &quot; the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind . &quot;
&quot; now that pre@@ p test medicine has been procu@@ red , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV @-@ infected people . &quot;
&quot; Shar@@ on Ho@@ d@@ g@@ son , Shadow Minister of Health , said : &quot; &quot; the beginning of the pre@@ p process is welcome and over@@ due after months of delays and hes@@ it@@ ant implementation . &quot;
the evidence shows how transform@@ ative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life @-@ changing infection .
this attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of pre@@ p .
&quot; now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV @-@ infected , and that it will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society . &quot;
living a great life : mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Ear@@ ls Court apartment into a spacious home
&quot; Jo@@ anne Lei@@ gh , a former bank@@ ress with a passion for real estate , res@@ igned from a big house in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge to Ear@@ ls Court Apartment in 2014 . &quot;
it is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jo@@ anne has not packed and sold her bags .
&quot; before that I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Kni@@ gh@@ ts@@ bridge , &quot; says Jo@@ anne . &quot;
I was looking for something comparable to my price .
I was shown this apartment in Ear@@ ls Court and it had the same high ceilings .
I fell in love with them and made an offer this day . &quot;
&quot; since the first inspection , the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely over@@ hau@@ led . &quot;
originally a one @-@ room property with a ne@@ sted layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - Jo@@ anne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height .
&quot; I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light . &quot;
&quot; that was my request , &quot; &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Du@@ ck &amp; Sh@@ ed by Er@@ fan Az@@ adi in Not@@ ting Hill to use the 12.@@ 5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other , so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand . &quot;
Er@@ fan had to think cre@@ atively to solve the requirement .
&quot; the steel work is rather complicated , &quot; he explains . &quot;
&quot; we had to arrange the rooms in such a way , that they were stack@@ ed on top of each other without having to bend . &quot;
&quot; it was not only about building a simple platform , but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . &quot;
this arrangement enabled Er@@ fan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .
&quot; for the mezzanine , a classic copper @-@ light window from Ret@@ rou@@ vi@@ us looks down over the gl@@ amor@@ ous living area . &quot;
&quot; mirr@@ ored gold pieces , silver accents and vintage Ser@@ ge Mou@@ lin lighting set the style for the program . &quot;
&quot; the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light . &quot;
&quot; on both ends , a short corridor is mirr@@ ored to allow him to work longer . &quot;
&quot; in the kitchen , the mirr@@ oring feels like a window into another room . &quot;
&quot; at the entrance , mirr@@ ored units provide space for all the cutlery and glasses of Jo@@ anne . &quot;
&quot; through the perception of a gl@@ amor@@ ous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used . &quot;
fol@@ dable kitchens are nothing new .
the special thing about this is that it is a garage door .
&quot; a bit of engineering came in , &quot; explains Er@@ fan of the reinforced , vene@@ ered MDF door . &quot;
&quot; it is important , so when you push the door , it slides very easily . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Jo@@ anne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; in a ru@@ di@@ mentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size . &quot;
&quot; here , they managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high @-@ quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage . &quot;
&quot; the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , &quot; says Er@@ fan . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t love the electrical sockets in the walls .
&quot; these are important , but they do not play with your heart . &quot;
it shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meter number of some standard in something quite amazing .
&quot; in fact , like Jo@@ anne , you could decide not to leave it . &quot;
brothers fight for a $ 500 million real estate empire
&quot; two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dy@@ nasty , in a dispute over one of the largest real estate markets of Victori@@ as worth more than $ 500 million . &quot;
&quot; the former director of the &apos; Carl@@ ton Football Club &apos; and developer Col@@ in De Lu@@ tis lives in a villa in To@@ or@@ ak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul . &quot;
&quot; Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; together with her mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street , Coll@@ ing@@ wood . &quot;
&quot; there , the West@@ co family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores . &quot;
it was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars .
&quot; this money was invested in real estate , and De Lu@@ tis portfolio now covers offices in the city centre , the development areas of Br@@ uns@@ wick and Sor@@ ren@@ to , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Bul@@ ler as well as shopping m@@ alls in the suburbs . &quot;
&quot; after an agreement with her dec@@ eased father , Col@@ in - by Paul as &quot; principal operator and the dominant personality &quot; in the De Lu@@ tis family - has about two thirds of the company &apos;s assets and Paul about one @-@ third . &quot;
&quot; according to a court file , this means that Col@@ in property has a value of $ 3@@ 16 million and Paul worth $ 17@@ 6 million . &quot;
the division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul .
&quot; the divisions proposed by Col@@ in have left him with what I thought for the best objects , &quot; he wrote in 2015 in a first Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it . &quot;
&quot; last Friday , after several failed negotiations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place . &quot;
&quot; the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - of which Col@@ in , as Paul claims , excluded him . &quot;
&quot; Col@@ in ar@@ gues that this is not true , but tells Paul to manage some possessions in@@ compet@@ ently . &quot;
&quot; in an early Aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ it submitted by Col@@ in , he says he hopes to settle the dispute . &quot;
&quot; my Italian heritage stipul@@ ates that the family is the most important priority , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; the costs are in the fall , with hundreds of pages with aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its , emails and reports from companies , including Del@@ o@@ itte , Pit@@ cher Partners and Charter K@@ eck Cra@@ mer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan M@@ yers , Q@@ C , and both parties held by law firms . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. De Lu@@ tis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk bars and delic@@ at@@ essen in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Br@@ uns@@ wick in the early se@@ ven@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; they used security to buy the Coll@@ ing@@ wood property , in which Col@@ in opened the first Je@@ ann@@ ings of the family . &quot;
Col@@ in says he started West@@ co when he was &quot; in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child ( about 10 years old ) .
&quot; Anna De Lu@@ tis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property to their sons . &quot;
&quot; Luigi repeatedly said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lu@@ tis group , Col@@ in claims that at leaving the company $ 10 million and Luke 26 million dollars were paid . &quot;
&quot; both Luke and Mark were , &quot; &quot; Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation . &quot;
Col@@ in has kept himself very close even though he was a former AF@@ L board member and after a biography of 2015 by Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ire the best friend of the TV star .
Fair@@ fax Media contacted Col@@ in and Paul De Lu@@ tis and their lawyers .
&quot; just Col@@ in answered by SMS to say &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t really say much , &quot; &quot; because the case is before the courts . &quot;
&quot; it is very , very sad , that my brother Paul decided to su@@ e me and draw our family name through the courts , &quot; he wrote . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of 2016 , Col@@ in wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother &apos;s demands . &quot;
&quot; our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current fight , &quot; &quot; he said , adding that he &quot; still hope for a solution . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Friday , this hope seemed to be over . &quot;
&quot; our affair will be resolved in the near future from the courts , &quot; &quot; wrote Col@@ in . &quot;
the Tru@@ mp appointed new Chief of Staff to limit the media abst@@ in@@ ence of the President .
others have tried and failed .
perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .
&quot; if so , he will be the first . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co reports that the White House staff head is planning to limit the flow of information to President Tru@@ mp , including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more dis@@ counted rate . &quot;
here is a piece of re@@ porter Jos@@ h Da@@ w@@ sey :
&quot; when John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Tru@@ mp White House which he wanted to repair : poor information that got into the hands of the president . &quot;
Kelly said that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in brief@@ ings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information .
Kell@@ ys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to t@@ ame tru@@ mp by monitoring its media diet .
&quot; President Tru@@ mp &apos;s relationship with television reaches decades back - and now , where he is at the White House , his TV advertising is still strong . &quot;
&quot; if the candidate Tru@@ mp was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were too convincing , &quot; &quot; said the former election campaign advisor Sam N@@ un@@ berg in February towards Politi@@ co . &quot;
&quot; politi@@ cos Tara Pal@@ mer@@ i wrote at the time that &quot; the key to keep Tru@@ mp Twitter habit under control , according to six former election campaigns officials , insi@@ sts that his personal media consumption involves a steady lob@@ b@@ ying . &quot;
okay .
but the idea that Tru@@ mp &apos;s Twitter habit was ever &quot; under control &quot; is ridi@@ culous .
perhaps these campaign officials know something we don &apos;t know yet - that Tru@@ mp T@@ we@@ ets would have included even more combus@@ ti@@ bles without their intervention .
we will probably never know anything about the twe@@ ets that Tru@@ mp has not sent .
&quot; if his employees manage to keep his anger away from him a few times , their efforts have paid off . &quot;
but no one has consistently avoided that Tru@@ mp Contro@@ versi@@ es cause controversy .
&quot; part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Tru@@ mp material that may promote their views from the world . &quot;
&quot; Politi@@ co - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advis@@ ers , the president for strategic reasons doub@@ ting du@@ bi@@ ous information . &quot;
this was an example described by Re@@ porter Sh@@ ane Gold@@ macher :
&quot; current and former Tru@@ mp officials say that Tru@@ mp can react like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaged le@@ aks , and that he can find out where they come from . &quot;
&quot; this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the president of a copy of an article by Got@@ tar@@ .com , the website of Internet pro@@ voc@@ ate Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff K@@ atie Wal@@ sh , &quot; to be the source behind a he@@ ap of being &quot; in the White House . &quot;
&quot; although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of ch@@ ic@@ ans , or that he offered no concrete evidence , or that he sold false alle@@ gations in the past and rev@@ oked them . &quot;
Tru@@ mp read the article and started asking employees about Wal@@ sh .
&quot; Gold@@ macher added that the former Chief of Staff Rein@@ ce Pri@@ eb@@ us and the Secretary General of the White House , Ro@@ b Por@@ ter , have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper@@ work , the Tru@@ mp . &quot;
how did that work ?
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .
&quot; perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Pri@@ eb@@ us , but Tru@@ mp is still his impul@@ sive self , and his advis@@ ors are still striving for influence . &quot;
these imm@@ utable factors make Kell@@ ys mission very difficult .
most sought @-@ after criminals get post from Euro@@ pol
&quot; as the address is unknown , the help of the population will be asked and hoped . &quot;
the police across Europe sent postcards to dangerous criminals during this summer ( virtual ) postcards .
&quot; since the addresses of the most sought @-@ after bur@@ gl@@ ars are not known naturally , references from the population will be hoped and asked . &quot;
&quot; Euro@@ pol reported on Friday of the action , following the &quot; &quot; EU Most W@@ an@@ ted &quot; &quot; advent calendar from the winter . &quot;
&quot; the experiences would have shown that many fle@@ eting of holiday destinations hide , the name was Euro@@ pol . &quot;
I have put together 21 postcards for sought @-@ after criminals from 21 EU countries .
&quot; since 2016 , the website www.@@ e@@ um@@ ost@@ um has been available for more than 2.5 million copies . &quot;
&quot; 36 of the online respon@@ dents have been arrested so far , at least eleven of them on the basis of references to the publication on the website . &quot;
travelers negotiate a dit@@ ch and return to the &apos; Million@@ aire series &apos;
&quot; some of the weal@@ thi@@ est home@@ owners of the West Mid@@ lands are again with some determined travellers on the foot of the war , who have negotiated a dit@@ ch drawn by the commune in order to rec@@ laim a field in front of their mansion houses . &quot;
&quot; travelers have par@@ ked their 20 car@@ avans on a field outside of a prosper@@ ous road from Soli@@ hull , which is called the &quot; million@@ aire series . &quot; &quot;
&quot; they brought horses , babies and an army of vans , after they were thrown out only in May , without being deter@@ red by a dig@@ ging dug by the Council to prevent their sei@@ zur@@ es . &quot;
the tac@@ t@@ ful group found a gap in the defense units and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained un@@ hin@@ dered to find a way .
&quot; angry residents have pushed the Council of Soli@@ hull , who said it was &quot; useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
&quot; an anonymous inhabit@@ ant said : &quot; &quot; they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley He@@ ath , where they threw stones on the pass@@ ers @-@ by . &quot;
&quot; the Council must be forced through shame to implement it , as it was useless to deal with the problem . &quot;
the travellers were there in May and were moved forward and are now back .
&quot; more came yesterday evening , probably more today . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks . &quot;
&quot; I live on Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community , if the Council does not even stop . &quot;
&quot; a local who did not want to be named said : &quot; &quot; it is ridi@@ culous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers , only to be pl@@ under@@ ed by another round . &quot;
the figures have increased this time and even a horse is seen in the park area . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Soli@@ hull of Soli@@ hull said : &quot; &quot; we are aware of an un@@ authorised camp on the land beyond the Stre@@ ets@@ brook Road and work with the police of Soli@@ hull . we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible announce an anti @-@ social or criminal behaviour by the police by calling 101 . &quot;
this helps to create a picture of the situation in which the court must consider when we present our case .
Bir@@ k@@ enhof becomes Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise
the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise is located in the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof .
the house in front of the gates of Freuden@@ stadt is currently undergoing renovation and is scheduled to be re@@ opened on 1 March next year .
these are good news for the city .
&quot; because with the closure of the Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof by the then Ambiente company company mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and income from the local tax . &quot;
&quot; in the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving to the administrative district , the hotel building was offered to the administrative office as a collective shelter , which provided controversial discussions . &quot;
the city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location .
&quot; at that time , the decision was not un@@ disputed in the Municipal Council . &quot;
&quot; but especially Freuden@@ stadt &apos;s mayor , Julian Os@@ s@@ wald , defended the hotel location and spoke of serious prospects at that time . &quot;
he should be right .
the group Lu@@ is@@ enh@@ otels with managing director Birgit Sch@@ erer with registered office in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern has acquired the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three @-@ star plus category under the name Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise .
the group has four houses with the Freuden@@ stadt object .
two of them in Bad Berg@@ z@@ ab@@ ern and one in Bad Herren@@ al@@ b .
&quot; welcome to Hotel Lu@@ ise , Lu@@ isen@@ park , Park@@ hotel Lu@@ ise and now Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise . &quot;
&quot; the former Hotel Bir@@ k@@ enhof has been standing in front of the entrance for a long time already , and when you enter the house it becomes clear that extensive renov@@ ations are carried out . &quot;
&quot; the floors were torn out , ceilings partly disman@@ tled , old bath@@ tu@@ bs removed from the rooms . &quot;
the entire hotel building is a single building site .
there is still much to do until March .
&quot; it is actually a nice place , &quot; says Thomas Sch@@ erer in conversation with our newspaper . &quot;
everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .
&quot; the rooms are equipped with large walk @-@ in showers , the entrance area is re@@ designed , new windows are installed . &quot;
&quot; everything should be &quot; &quot; pretty &quot; &quot; later , as Thomas Sch@@ erer says . &quot;
&quot; we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it . &quot;
&quot; swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities . &quot;
&quot; they do not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lau@@ ter@@ bad , but already at a higher inner city level , Sch@@ erer emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; the Wald@@ hotel Lu@@ ise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide , explains Sch@@ erer . &quot;
&quot; individual vac@@ ation@@ ers , groups or business people should feel comfortable at the hotel . &quot;
&quot; he has already been talks with O@@ B Julian Os@@ s@@ wald and Tourist Director Michael Kr@@ ause , says Sch@@ erer . &quot;
the city &apos;s performances are similar to those of the hotel group .
&quot; we are on the same line . &quot;
&quot; according to the amount of investments , Thomas Sch@@ erer doesn &apos;t want to determine exactly . &quot;
&quot; just below a million euros , he reck@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the outer systems are also brought onto the front man , which is already clearly visible . &quot;
&quot; in a courtyard , there is a large terrace , which is accessible by the restaurant , which is open to the public . &quot;
Thomas Sch@@ erer is optimistic : &quot; Freuden@@ stadt is a good market . &quot;
Russia affair : US Special En@@ lar@@ gement sets up Grand Jury
&quot; in the Russia affair around US President Donald Tru@@ mp , Special Agent Robert Mu@@ eller was said to have used a so @-@ called Grand Jury after a report . &quot;
&quot; over the past few weeks , the body has been working on the work , wrote the Wall Street Journal , calling on people familiar with the matter . &quot;
the paper presented the step as a sign that Mu@@ eller had expanded and intensified its investigations .
the CN@@ N station reported that there are already first inv@@ itations of the body in connection with a meeting between the Tru@@ mp elder son and a Russian lawyer .
&quot; for some time now , U.S. intelligence services acc@@ use the Krem@@ lin to intervene deliberately in the 2016 presidential campaign . &quot;
Mu@@ eller investigated whether there were agreements between the Tru@@ mp campaign team and Moscow .
&quot; in the focus of the investigation , several men are supposed to stand in the election campaign as advis@@ ors to the re@@ public@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; according to reports , Mu@@ eller took a closer look at more and more Tru@@ mps &apos;s private and business environment . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , the &quot; Washington Post &quot; wrote that the Special En@@ counter Tru@@ mp has personally moved to the centre and investig@@ ates whether the president could possibly obstruc@@ t the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the course of the affair . &quot;
the main task of Grand jur@@ ys is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether they should be charged .
Grand Jur@@ ys are therefore also called In@@ dict@@ ments .
&quot; most of the time , they are turned on when they are larger and controversial cases . &quot;
the procedure is always followed behind closed doors .
the board can also be turned on by the public prosec@@ utor to charge persons under oath .
&quot; according to the CN@@ N , charges have already been issued that revol@@ ve around the meeting between Donald Tru@@ mp J@@ r. and a Russian lawyer . &quot;
people who were involved in the meeting were called upon to say a statement called it in the report .
&quot; in addition , they should provide documents . &quot;
&quot; in addition to Tru@@ mp J@@ r. , Tru@@ mp Consult@@ ants and son @-@ in @-@ law J@@ ared K@@ ush@@ ner as well as his former election leader Paul Man@@ a@@ fort were in the conversation . &quot;
&quot; legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the introduction shows that Mu@@ eller does not let himself be in@@ timi@@ dated in his work , and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly . &quot;
&quot; however , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the new revelations , the president on Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to show the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents . &quot;
&quot; the Russia story is a total invention , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; the subject gives the Democrats an opportunity to &quot; &quot; feel good &quot; &quot; because they have nothing else to talk about . &quot;
his special advisor T@@ y Cob@@ b explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .
&quot; but they usually work in secret , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
the White House advoc@@ ates all measures that accelerated the work of the special investig@@ ator in a &quot; fair &quot; way .
former FBI director James Com@@ ey said three times not to be as@@ cer@@ tained against the president .
&quot; there is no reason to assume that something has changed , it was said in the declaration . &quot;
but Mu@@ eller had only been used after Tru@@ mp had fired Com@@ ey .
&quot; because of this ro@@ oting , accus@@ ations against Tru@@ mp have become loud , he challenged the judi@@ ci@@ ary . &quot;
&quot; in June , Com@@ ey said before a Senate Committee , Tru@@ mp asked him to set up an investigation against the National Security Ad@@ visor Michael Fl@@ yn@@ n . &quot;
the president is under great pressure for the investigation .
&quot; after the presentation of US media , the White House gathered material against the Special En@@ counter and its employees . &quot;
this triggered speculation about whether Tru@@ mp Mu@@ eller wanted to release Mu@@ eller .
&quot; unlike an independent investig@@ ator of Congress such as the Wat@@ erg@@ ate affair about the later retired President Richard Ni@@ xon , Mu@@ eller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the urge of the President of the Ministry of Justice . &quot;
&quot; however , several Sen@@ ators of both parties want to prevent such a step . &quot;
two groups of Republi@@ can and Democratic sen@@ ators proposed legislation on Thursday that the Special Agent could no longer be dismissed as easily .
Antar@@ ctic : gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg drives in Antar@@ cti@@ ca
&quot; in the west Antar@@ ctic , a gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg of the barely seven @-@ fold size of Berlin has been solved by the Sch@@ el@@ ven . &quot;
this was announced by the Bre@@ mer@@ ha@@ ven@@ er Alfred @-@ We@@ gener @-@ Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .
&quot; the col@@ os@@ sus of about one tri@@ l@@ lion tons and 5@@ 800 square kilometres driving now to the north and will probably need two , three years until it mel@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest glaci@@ ers that have registered in the past three decades . &quot;
there is no danger to man from him .
&quot; to what extent climate change has played a role in the departure of the ic@@ e@@ berg , it is unclear after research data . &quot;
&quot; all in all , however , for some 30 years , there have been a series of unusual collap@@ ses of ice cre@@ ams in the region , writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NS@@ ID@@ C ) in a fact background . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
the now sever@@ ed col@@ os@@ sus has so far been a part of the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven .
Sch@@ el@@ ven is floating on the sea and is fed by large glaci@@ ers .
it grows ever further into the sea and breaks down regularly .
the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ ven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula .
&quot; North of this hor@@ ses@@ ho@@ e , the balance of wa@@ xes and ab@@ rupt was disturbed several years ago . &quot;
&quot; a complete Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is broken there , writes A@@ WI researcher Daniela Jan@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot to say that the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ ven is in danger , because the front edge has never gone as far as it is currently . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ice sheet stands under tension and can be dis@@ integrated if a key point breaks down a piece . &quot;
melting of Sch@@ el@@ ven and Eis@@ berg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as after the melting itself .
&quot; however , the loss of the Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us leads to the fact that the glaci@@ ers can flow directly into the sea and can flow far more quickly than before . &quot;
&quot; this could possibly increase sea level , but only to a small degree , writes the British research project on the observation of Antar@@ cti@@ ca ( Mi@@ das ) . &quot;
&quot; according to A@@ WI statements , the Lar@@ sen @-@ C @-@ Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us is the fourth largest shr@@ ine of the Antar@@ ctic with almost 50,000 square kilometres . &quot;
&quot; at the crossing from the mainland , it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters . &quot;
there it breaks down regularly .
&quot; although it is a natural happening and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the iron sign now comes into a more dangerous position , &quot; said Martin O &apos;@@ L@@ ear@@ y of British S@@ wan@@ sea University . &quot;
&quot; this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , &quot; &quot; he also confirmed . &quot;
&quot; among scientists was controversial whether the Lar@@ sen @-@ C Sch@@ el@@ hag@@ us should grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collap@@ ses , said his colleague Adrian Lu@@ ck@@ man and added : &quot; our models say that it will be less stable . &quot;
but this development will last for decades .
&quot; even if these researchers do not bring back this gigantic ic@@ e@@ berg back to climate change , many glaci@@ ers of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past few decades . &quot;
this long skirt of the Antar@@ ctic stretches towards South America .
&quot; according to data from the research programme British Antar@@ ctic Survey , the ice surface of the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s . &quot;
the drop in temperature has contributed to the decline .
&quot; the Antar@@ ctic Peninsula has been war@@ med by around three degrees in the last 50 years , making it one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest . &quot;
CD@@ U wants Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f at the staff
&quot; because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vac@@ ant positions , the CD@@ U demands to res@@ ign from the employer &apos;s association in order to become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; only a few minutes before the summer break , the Krei@@ tag has drow@@ ned 41 new jobs in administration . &quot;
more than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in M@@ ett@@ mann .
&quot; now , 17 trainees have left their first working day . &quot;
the apprenticeship places in the circle are obviously very sought after .
some 6@@ 20 applications were to be recorded for the places to be awarded this year .
&quot; nevertheless , the circle is still missing personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks . &quot;
&quot; currently , there are 50 non @-@ occupied places in the district of M@@ ett@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; among other things , we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of the general administration . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to take the initiative together with the F@@ DP and the U@@ WG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration .
&quot; according to the wishes of the parties , the administration will develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development . &quot;
&quot; the aim is not only to cover short @-@ term needs for skilled workers , but to counter@@ act the future @-@ oriented application short@@ ages . &quot;
&quot; the overall concept should ori@@ ent itself internally and extern@@ ally , show concrete measures for cross @-@ entran@@ ts and include an education offensive , call on CD@@ U , F@@ DP and U@@ WG . &quot;
this sounds like a good approach .
because the circle has it to do with personal problems that you didn &apos;t know before .
other cities adverti@@ se good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .
&quot; the speech is of a real &quot; &quot; competition of public employers . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition , there is a high number of employees who ex@@ crete disease or age caused by the service . &quot;
&quot; high time for action , so that not even more jobs remain un@@ occupied . &quot;
&quot; but Klaus @-@ Dieter Krieg , president of the CD@@ U , goes beyond the joint application with his party . &quot;
he already caused a bad surprise already in the circular day when he publicly challenged the personnel costs and ba@@ ff@@ led the rest of the parties .
&quot; &quot; &quot; people want all possibilities to be verified which allow a withdrawal from the communal employers &apos; association . &quot;
&quot; if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice , the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county @-@ affiliated towns - should aim for a &quot; Hau@@ st@@ ari@@ f , &quot; so peoples . &quot;
&quot; in this way , the CD@@ U tries to pay better the employees and officials than it actually envis@@ ages the tari@@ ff for the public service . &quot;
&quot; the sal@@ aries are currently precisely prescribed , increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level , which is oriented towards professional years . &quot;
but the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .
&quot; only a few weeks ago , new premises had to be established in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Pro@@ stitution Act . &quot;
&quot; not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Mr. Thomas Hend@@ ele and Kreis@@ direktor Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff . &quot;
Italy tigh@@ tens the tone to NGO migrants rescue boats
&quot; Italy has warned NGOs that use lif@@ ebo@@ ats for migrants in the Mediterranean , warned that they are not allowed to continue this unless they adhere to new rules for their operations . &quot;
&quot; if NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , &quot; said Interior Minister Marco Minn@@ iti in an interview with the Turin daily La St@@ amp@@ a . &quot;
&quot; Min@@ ni@@ tis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confis@@ cated a boat of the German relief organisation &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , because their team effectively collabor@@ ated with traffi@@ ckers in a way that facilit@@ ated illegal immigration . &quot;
&quot; the relief organisation , which has been in operation since one year , refused to express himself to detailed alle@@ gations by the Italian prosec@@ utor Ambro@@ gio Car@@ to@@ sio . &quot;
&quot; we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , &quot; the organisation said in an opinion on the social media . &quot;
&quot; we can assess all alle@@ gations that are currently being raised , after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . &quot;
&quot; the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of &apos; Youth Ret@@ tet &apos; , the I@@ u@@ vent@@ a , since October . &quot;
&quot; it is thought that its crew takes din@@ gh@@ y migrants aboard , which can be delivered directly by traffi@@ ckers , and that the smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers can go off so that the ships can be used again . &quot;
&quot; at least one such meeting took place at least 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast , according to the prosec@@ utor &apos;s act , whose content was published by Italian media . &quot;
&quot; the crew is suspected of over@@ seeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives . &quot;
&quot; under the Code of Con@@ duct , boats such as I@@ u@@ vent@@ a must have an Italian police officer monitoring their activities . &quot;
&quot; only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to keep the code : save the Children , Mo@@ as from Malta and Pro @-@ Activ@@ a Open Ar@@ ms from Spain . &quot;
&quot; the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not bring &quot; substantial changes or obstruc@@ tions &quot; of their rescue operations . &quot;
among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize lau@@ re@@ ate organization Doc@@ tors With@@ out Bor@@ ders ( MS@@ F ) .
&quot; Minn@@ iti has now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks , suggest@@ ing that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast@@ guards and co @-@ operation with local may@@ ors have borne fruit . &quot;
&quot; in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with C@@ had , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe . &quot;
asc@@ ents and Tri@@ als
&quot; nine Wei@@ ler@@ mer Bi@@ kers , the &quot; Berlin Out@@ post &quot; and two guest drivers met at Wach@@ en@@ heim in the North Pal@@ at@@ inate , to enjoy Trieste and sights for four days . &quot;
there were three friendly guides available for this purpose .
the accommodation in the Wach@@ en@@ heimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .
the Burg@@ und@@ y and wine festival of Wach@@ en@@ heim was a welcome extra .
the first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Micha@@ el@@ skap@@ elle above Dei@@ des@@ heim .
&quot; there were view@@ points , partly on towers , from which one could look far over the P@@ fäl@@ zer forest and the up@@ stream levels . &quot;
&quot; in between , there were again and again longer asc@@ ents , for the long tri@@ als p@@ opp@@ y . &quot;
on the second day we went to Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim to Sal@@ ine and to the folk festival saus@@ age market .
&quot; once again a bel@@ ve@@ dere asc@@ ended to the viewpoint , connected by &quot; &quot; flo@@ wi@@ ge &quot; &quot; tri@@ als and moderate asc@@ ents . &quot;
on the last two days there were again a lot of al@@ timet@@ ers .
&quot; caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shel@@ ters brought welcome breaks . &quot;
&quot; in Bad Dür@@ k@@ heim , the bi@@ kers inhal@@ ed healing br@@ ine in the open @-@ air inhal@@ atorium . &quot;
Neustadt was controlled too .
&quot; after 17@@ 3 kilometres and almost 4@@ 500 metres altitude , the group met the P@@ fäl@@ zer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural . &quot;
console instead of grass - Bundes@@ liga upgra@@ ds for e @-@ sport
do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium race against wind and weather ?
&quot; fact : e @-@ sport has long become a serious industry , become a lu@@ cr@@ ative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gau@@ ges included . &quot;
&quot; this has also recognized the first federal li@@ ga@@ des , which are increasingly involved in this field . &quot;
&quot; the beginning of 2015 was the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg , later the FC Schal@@ ke 04 and last of the V@@ f@@ B Stuttgart , who founded an e @-@ sport division in the middle of July , and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract . &quot;
&quot; we hope to inspire very new young target groups for the V@@ f@@ B , &quot; says CEO Jochen R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
he is sure that there are still a number of clubs on this train .
&quot; on the next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first Inter@@ active Club World Cup , in which the gam@@ ers of different clubs compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; besides Schal@@ ke and Wolfs@@ burg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main or PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven qualify . &quot;
Robin D@@ utt also sees great potential in e @-@ sport .
the ex @-@ trainer of Bayer Le@@ verk@@ usen and Wer@@ der Bremen meanwhile advises an agency for virtual football players .
&quot; the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 @-@ year @-@ olds , that the young people will go into the stadium also in the future , &quot; says the 52 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; and : the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets , especially the Asian . &quot;
&quot; with prominent e @-@ sports@@ men under the contract , one could be far more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Federal Tax Treaty to Asia . &quot;
what is it all about ?
&quot; in e @-@ sport , computer games such as League Of Legends , &quot; D@@ ota 2 , &quot; &quot; Co@@ unter@@ strike , &quot; or the football simulation of FIFA are challenged on competition level . &quot;
&quot; as in the normal sport , Li@@ sts have long since established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other . &quot;
&quot; and in the Asian Games 2022 , e @-@ sport is already part of the official program . &quot;
but is it really a sport ?
&quot; for many , the idea is safe to use . &quot;
In@@ go F@@ rob@@ erie has long dealt with the question .
&quot; e @-@ sport is a sport for the professor at the German Spor@@ th@@ ochschule in Cologne because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions which one can find in classical sports - such as increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormon@@ al changes . &quot;
&quot; in addition , cognitive skills , a technical and tac@@ tical understanding and a fast reaction ability . &quot;
professional gam@@ ers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition .
&quot; the fit player is a good player . &quot;
&quot; however , F@@ rob@@ erie also sees problems : &quot; dop@@ ing becomes more and more a topic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; controls are difficult to perform in online games , and in the scene the structures of classic sports are missing . &quot;
&quot; in a positive way , the scientist emphas@@ ises the high integr@@ ative effect of E @-@ sport . &quot;
&quot; players are on the move internationally , this is like a big global family , there are no intercultural obstacles . &quot;
a study of corporate consultancy Del@@ o@@ itte and the Federal Association Inter@@ active Entertainment software ( BI@@ U ) predic@@ ts rapid growth in E @-@ sport .
&quot; in 2016 , 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany , mainly via advertising , sponsor@@ ing and big tournaments . &quot;
&quot; in three years , turnover is expected to be at 130 million . &quot;
&quot; against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundes@@ liga , this is little . &quot;
&quot; however , the e @-@ sport is no longer far from other established sports such as hand@@ ball , basketball or hockey , &quot; writes the Del@@ o@@ itte advis@@ ors . &quot;
many countries are already on the move .
&quot; big markets are Asia and the USA , where ex @-@ basketball player Sha@@ qu@@ ille O &apos;@@ Ne@@ al and Bas@@ eb@@ all@@ star Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez are participating in the US Team N@@ R@@ G e@@ Sports . &quot;
Hollywood actor Ash@@ ton Kut@@ cher is investing in the e@@ Sport competitions Uni@@ kr@@ n .
&quot; in Europe too , some things are happening . &quot;
&quot; in a Norwegian school , e @-@ sport was introduced as a classroom , says F@@ rob@@ erie . &quot;
&quot; in the Netherlands and France , the football first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e @-@ sport department . &quot;
&quot; in the European comparison , Germany dec@@ lines behind , &quot; explains V@@ f@@ B @-@ Chairman R@@ ött@@ ger@@ mann . &quot;
only to fall into nostal@@ gia and to clarify the old times is no longer enough today .
&quot; the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but also to align the company with the modern market . &quot;
&quot; we live in a digi@@ ti@@ zed world , &quot; &quot; says D@@ utt . &quot;
you can &apos;t keep in mind that everything stays as it always was with football .

Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter sentenced to suicide because of the texts Con@@ rad Roy
a woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boy@@ friend through texts and calls to suicide .
&quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condem@@ nation behind bars and five years have been exposed to par@@ ole . &quot;
Car@@ ter was convic@@ ted in June of Con@@ rad Roy &apos;s neg@@ ligent killing that took place on 13 July 2014 .
the father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : &quot; my family is un@@ comfor@@ ting .
my son was my best friend . &quot;
Car@@ ter was allowed to remain free until his appointment .
&quot; she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness . &quot;
&quot; dressed in red trousers and a cream colored bl@@ ouse , Car@@ ter stood there with tears in her eyes , with folded hands and eyes directed down@@ wards when she was convic@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; their actions have killed Con@@ rad Roy , &quot; &quot; said the prosec@@ utor to the court . &quot;
she finished his life to make her own better .
&quot; she took no responsibility , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; she has shown no repentance . &quot;
but Car@@ ter &apos;s lawyer said it was a &quot; aw@@ ful circum@@ stance that she fully regre@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; judge Lawrence Mon@@ iz said , however , he did not find that their &quot; age or maturity &quot; or even their mental illness have a significant effect on their actions . &quot;
&quot; a public prosec@@ utor read a statement by Ro@@ ys &apos;s mother Lyn@@ n Roy , saying that there is &quot; no day in which I do not pray the loss of my beloved son . &quot;
&quot; I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything . I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ ys &apos;s sister , Cam@@ dy@@ n Roy , said she was &quot; &quot; persecuted &quot; &quot; by the recognition that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or would be an a@@ unt for his children . &quot;
&quot; no longer the only person I have been with since my birth every day is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; the case seems to be a legal preced@@ ent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to commit another to commit suicide . &quot;
Car@@ ter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon mon@@ oxide pois@@ oning in a vehicle in 2014 .
&quot; the case drew attention to national attention , after Car@@ ter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life . &quot;
&quot; hang up , spring from a building , get yourself , I don &apos;t know , there are many ways , &quot; &quot; she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on vacation with his family . &quot;
&quot; in the moments before his suicide she wrote : &quot; you must do it , Con@@ rad &quot; and &quot; Every@@ thing you have to do is turn off the generator and you &apos;ll be free and happy . &quot;
judge Mon@@ iz said Car@@ ter &apos;s attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the event by some press .
the case has divided the legal opinion .
&quot; among the few who defended Car@@ ter , Am@@ anda Kno@@ x was a member of Am@@ anda Kno@@ x who was convic@@ ted of murder at her UK resident in Italy before she was acqu@@ itted two years ago . &quot;
&quot; Ms. Kno@@ x , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : &quot; Mich@@ elle Car@@ ter deserves compassion and help , not jail . &quot;
Joshua Kim@@ mich : learning from the new Mini @-@ L@@ ame of FC Bayern
that Joshua was allowed to run as captain for the Audi Cup at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence .
the FC Bayern won a big season to the Con@@ fed Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt .
&quot; what was different on his place in the cabin , Joshua didn &apos;t see me right away , even though the extra garment was very , very small . &quot;
&quot; but as far and wide on the second day of the Audi C@@ ups , of course , no Philipp L@@ ahm and no Manuel Neu@@ er had to be seen , he put the band@@ age in front of him to the arm . &quot;
&quot; the coach did not announce it , &quot; the Con@@ fed Cup winner said after his first deployment as Bavaria Captain . &quot;
&quot; good , the entrance could have been better than at 0 : 2 against SS@@ C Nap@@ oli . &quot;
but Kim@@ i was able to interpret the sign of the coach .
&quot; not the eight @-@ year old Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal was chosen as a guide in the C @-@ El@@ f , who had been welcomed by youth players , de@@ but@@ ants and just out of the holiday , but he . &quot;
&quot; sugar is best distributed to those , to whom you want to eat much , which you want to keep in your mood . &quot;
&quot; so who was chosen to take on the heritage of L@@ ahm , can use a little extra motivation only well . &quot;
Kim@@ mich confirmed : &quot; that &apos;s what you want as a player : take responsibility .
&quot; on Wednesday , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old fl@@ atten@@ ed as a mini @-@ under@@ took over the field . &quot;
&quot; right behind , this is now his position , the white band@@ age on the arm did her rest . &quot;
&quot; and Kim@@ i also worked in this initial formation , like the one who can take the ru@@ dder at the best . &quot;
&quot; he gave instructions , tried to direct the un@@ en@@ acted tro@@ upe . &quot;
&quot; he had a look at the whole , while many others were busy with himself . &quot;
&quot; Vi@@ dal , trying to over@@ play his missing fitness ( did not fold ) ; Ren@@ ato San@@ ches thus , on the devil come out of the performance of the Asia trip ( also only limited ) ; and Sebastian Ru@@ dy and Ni@@ kl@@ as Sü@@ le , in their first appearance in the Bavaria Tri@@ cot , did not fall negative . &quot;
&quot; after all , it worked very well . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ le ran beside Kim@@ me , Ru@@ dy before the defense , both were acting confi@@ dently . &quot;
&quot; the well @-@ known Nap@@ oli @-@ storm was often difficult , and Sü@@ le also tried a few times in the build @-@ up . &quot;
&quot; his colleague Ru@@ dy admitted that the result was &quot; &quot; not as we had hoped for . &quot; &quot; &quot;
but he also showed a decent performance at the debut .
&quot; game reloc@@ ation , tempo change : &quot; I was also brought up for this style . &quot;
&quot; as usual , this Bayern @-@ World is still for the newcom@@ ers , one looked after the game . &quot;
&quot; for example , Ru@@ dy did not have one or two in the cat@@ ac@@ om@@ bs , but determined six or seven interviews . &quot;
Kim@@ i said goodbye after a few cra@@ cking say@@ ings in the back of his new fellow players .
&quot; there he heard an interesting sentence from Sü@@ le : &quot; &quot; what &apos;s going on here , I already noticed . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , you simply have to win any game . &quot;
&quot; after all , he doesn &apos;t have to teach the new . &quot;
Al@@ aba motiv@@ ates Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ La@@ dies
David Al@@ aba believes in the success of our Ö@@ F@@ B ladies
Austria &apos;s most famous foot@@ b@@ aller reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wished the Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ ladies all the best .
the Bavaria @-@ Legi@@ on@@ ary is virtually club @-@ mate of Ö@@ F@@ B @-@ Kapit@@ än@@ in Schn@@ ader@@ beck and fe@@ ather@@ ed with our La@@ dies .
the T@@ we@@ et of the Austrian football player of the year and champion League winner should be a special motiv@@ ational injection .
the famous Bayern Dus@@ el might also need our ladies well .
company satisfied with Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate Minister : economy lo@@ oms Wis@@ d@@ ress@@ ings
&quot; it was often irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate . &quot;
this is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wis@@ ser ( F@@ DP ) is in office .
chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister .
&quot; Frank nat@@ us , Chairman of the Association of Tri@@ erer Enterprises ( V@@ TU ) , says : &quot; &quot; Wis@@ ser picks up the wishes of the economy , which blocked Lem@@ ke all together . &quot;
the largest turn@@ around sees nat@@ us in the infrastructure policy : the gap between the highway 1 between Kel@@ berg and Aden@@ au is now at the top of the country &apos;s priority list .
&quot; this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is expected to be building law . &quot;
&quot; a role in the plans of the country also plays the western circum@@ stance of Trier , which is in the urgent need of the Federal Highway Plan . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to take the course into operation in December 2020 , says Minist@@ eri@@ es@@ spokesperson Cornelia Hol@@ t@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; nat@@ us sees this as a sign to support regional , but internationally competitive companies . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Industry and Commerce ( I@@ HK ) Trier is seeking , as by Wis@@ ser , an Rheinland @-@ Pfalz @-@ label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports declining for ten years . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Wis@@ ser has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company , the Chamber of Commerce commen@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; the Chamber of Cra@@ fts of Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says managing director Matthias Sch@@ wal@@ bach . &quot;
a premium of 1000 Euro is planned for the passed master examination and 2500 euros if graduates within ten years after the master &apos;s education become self @-@ sufficient .
the home@@ work list for the country remains long .
&quot; the planned road building will quickly provide facts , but at the same time it fails the country of the necessary personnel , &quot; says Jan Glock@@ auer , CEO of the I@@ HK Trier . &quot;
&quot; of 56 new engineers , who wants to hire Wis@@ ser in the country &apos;s mobility , only 29 positions have been occupied so far . &quot;
the Chamber of Commerce calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .
&quot; CD@@ U spokesperson on CD@@ U , Christian Bal@@ d@@ auf , refers to the calculations of the Court of Audi@@ tors , the country will invest more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of regional roads in 2017 and 2018 . &quot;
Frank nat@@ us also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region .
&quot; in addition , the former broad@@ band construction in the country is also sober@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , regional companies only rated the power supply in an I@@ HK survey with a rating of 3,@@ 4 . &quot;
they compla@@ ined about stagn@@ ant internet connections and break@@ through@@ s .
&quot; ex @-@ Economy Minister E@@ vel@@ ine Lem@@ ke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and still sits in the Supervisory Board of the wind power company Pro Wind . &quot;
&quot; the Green Group left Lem@@ ke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where they already cleared the field after four months because of in@@ consisten@@ cies . &quot;
&quot; Audi to change 8@@ 50,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a counter reaction &quot;
&quot; one day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said it would offer to update the software in more than 3@@ 50,000 vehicles . &quot;
&quot; the BMW Group said that the company believes that &quot; there are smar@@ ter options than driving restrictions , &quot; and thus moved to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles . &quot;
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .
none of the companies described the under@@ tak@@ ings as a recall .
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions .
&quot; nitrogen oxi@@ des , em@@ itting diesel engines , are considered carcin@@ o@@ gens and can cause asthma . &quot;
&quot; the cost of autom@@ akers to install exhaust f@@ umes from diesel vehicles is also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of sei@@ zing the powerful car companies and ignor@@ ing the signs of the problem .
&quot; the companies are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so @-@ called switch @-@ off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but in normal driving conditions . &quot;
&quot; in the United States , several Volkswagen employees were indic@@ ted ; others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic . &quot;
&quot; last month , the former director of ther@@ mod@@ ynam@@ ics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the former manager , Z@@ ac@@ che@@ o Giovanni P@@ am@@ io , is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extra@@ dition and could be tried in the United States . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circum@@ vent the emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was expanded . &quot;
the inclusion of Audi into the investigation could not burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes dispro@@ portion@@ ately to the benefit of Volkswagen .
this message has the raft on Saturday at the Is@@ ar
the city wants to protect the Is@@ ar .
&quot; in order for the Is@@ ar visitors to participate , a raft travels through Munich on Saturday , which has a special message . &quot;
&quot; if you go back to Is@@ ar on Saturday , there will be a big raft between F@@ lau@@ cher and Rei@@ chen@@ bach@@ brücke . &quot;
&quot; and this is not a nasty raft , with Is@@ ar tourists . &quot;
but the construction department wants to clear up .
on the raft you can see a large Inf@@ ot@@ ran@@ spar@@ ent .
it shows a garbage dump .
the pr@@ elu@@ de to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Is@@ ar visitors .
with the motto &quot; True love is ... &quot; the understanding of the Is@@ ar is to be sharpen@@ ed as a proof of wildlife .
&quot; last summer , the raft went over the Is@@ ar and also this year there are other actions and measures to achieve a consider@@ ate and environmentally conscious behavior . &quot;
Mor@@ dil@@ los Kn@@ oll@@ enn@@ es and the Lau@@ ghter against the Sor@@ ry
&quot; Mor@@ di@@ llo was at times one of the most publi@@ ci@@ zed carto@@ ons of carto@@ ons , the no@@ bles of his characters are his trademarks . &quot;
&quot; also with 85 , the Argent@@ ine@@ an is still drawing and working on a film . &quot;
&quot; his message : laughter , &quot; for there is too much suffering in the world . &quot;
&quot; Guill@@ ermo Mor@@ di@@ llo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires . &quot;
&quot; in the first years as an artist , he worked as a drawer for greeting cards - which frustr@@ ated him . &quot;
&quot; the happ@@ i@@ est day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , &quot; &quot; he said once . &quot;
&quot; after stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came to him at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his carto@@ ons in &quot; Paris Match , &quot; and then also in the &quot; Stern &quot; and other leading magazines around the world . &quot;
&quot; even in China , Mor@@ di@@ llo thought a lot of fans . &quot;
again and again the artist was inspired by cities .
&quot; large , ro@@ un@@ dish Mor@@ di@@ llo figures in drawings with the Le@@ aning Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow . &quot;
&quot; in the early morning , according to his own specifications , he is still sitting at the drawing table , works every day for almost ten hours . &quot;
&quot; with cal@@ endar@@ s , puzzles , books for young and old , t @-@ shirts , pl@@ ush toys and watches , his funny figures continue to be spread worldwide . &quot;
he has been working on a cartoon and a TV series with his characters for six years .
the main person in the movie &quot; Cra@@ zy Island &quot; is a gi@@ ra@@ ffe - Mor@@ dil@@ los most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thous@@ and@@ ler as a counter player .
&quot; for the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which should come to the cinema screen in 2019 . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know exactly what they will say , it &apos;s strange for me , &quot; &quot; says Mor@@ di@@ llo . &quot;
the script is not written by him .
&quot; for this reason , he rather relies on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wor@@ dless . &quot;
la@@ ven@@ der from Provence threatened by climate change
&quot; it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change . &quot;
&quot; the la@@ ven@@ der is declining because of drought @-@ remin@@ ding conditions and insect @-@ borne insects , causing great head@@ aches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions . &quot;
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse , expert of the agricultural research institute CRI@@ EP@@ PA@@ M in Provence , said : &quot; &quot; the la@@ ven@@ der in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years and much more in the spring . &quot;
this has effects on the li@@ fes@@ pan of la@@ ven@@ der .
&quot; there is also a small Zi@@ k@@ ade , a micro@@ bacter@@ ium that transfers the d@@ warf ci@@ ca@@ das , and in very dry weather there are many of them . &quot;
and there is much on the game .
la@@ ven@@ der oil attracts not only holiday@@ makers but also for perf@@ umes and cosmetics .
&quot; Eric Cha@@ isse said : &quot; &quot; instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under@@ developed and either missing or weakened . &quot;
so we have fewer parts with essential oil . &quot;
&quot; the solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slow@@ ing of evap@@ oration from the ground , but also the spra@@ ying of plants with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought . &quot;
the town of Gei@@ sa in the Thurin@@ gian R@@ hö@@ n celebrates its 1200 @-@ year anniversary .

the assass@@ ination of a journalist under@@ lines the growing threat in Mexico
&quot; the staff of the weekly Ri@@ odo@@ ce usually meet Wedn@@ es@@ days to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sin@@ alo@@ a through organised crime , corrupt officials and un@@ ce@@ asing drugs wars . &quot;
&quot; but on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security . &quot;
they were told that it is important to change their routines .
&quot; two high @-@ ranking journalists are discussing what feels more secure : they should take their children into the office , who were the target of an attack with gr@@ en@@ ades in 2009 , or leave them at home . &quot;
&quot; security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutr@@ als , allies . &quot;
&quot; they ask the re@@ porters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , percep@@ tions and abdominal feelings are enough . &quot;
&quot; there are drug smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , politicians , business@@ men , journalists suspected of standing on the government &apos;s pay@@ roll list or cart@@ els , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . &quot;
&quot; there is no rest from the violence , and while the corp@@ ses are pil@@ ing up throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President En@@ rique P@@ ena Nie@@ to began his office in December 2012 . 5@@ 89 are after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year . &quot;
&quot; among the latter , her editor and inspir@@ er of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , co @-@ founder J@@ avier Val@@ dez Car@@ den@@ as . &quot;
&quot; the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , &quot; &quot; wrote Val@@ dez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs . &quot;
&quot; two re@@ porters in the 1930 &apos;s , Aaron I@@ bar@@ ra and Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez , wearing t @-@ shirts , which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panam@@ ah@@ ut . &quot;
&quot; the workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the re@@ porters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their night@@ mares , sle@@ e@@ pl@@ essness , par@@ ano@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; although a Son@@ der @-@ At@@ tor@@ ney General was built in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists , the Committee on the Protection of Journ@@ alists has only initiated two criminal proceedings . &quot;
&quot; as with most of the thousands of mur@@ ders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the mur@@ der@@ ers of journalists are rarely brought to trial . &quot;
&quot; in Ri@@ odo@@ ce they still insist on treating the violence of Sin@@ alo@@ a , although they are in@@ consol@@ able and although the terrain is now more tre@@ ach@@ erous . &quot;
&quot; without information about the mur@@ der@@ ers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says I@@ bar@@ ra . &quot;
&quot; it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; as long as we don &apos;t know the why , we di@@ str@@ ust all . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of May 15 , Val@@ dez left the office of the newspaper Ri@@ odo@@ ce in the capital of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Cor@@ oll@@ a was stopped by two men . he was forced out of his car and was shot on him 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with &quot; twelve river . &quot; &quot;
the sho@@ oter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .
Val@@ dez was 50 years old .
he left a wife and two adult children .
ru@@ mo@@ urs tend to fly around freely in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
but on the subject of Val@@ dez there is practically nothing but silence .
&quot; since Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s arrest last year and extra@@ dition to the United States in January , Sin@@ alo@@ a had become one of the bloo@@ dies@@ t batt@@ le@@ fields of the country , as rival fac@@ tions are fighting here to fill the vacuum . &quot;
&quot; it doesn &apos;t matter that in Sin@@ alo@@ a someone or more people are shot on the street every day , or that the cemetery is full of orn@@ ate , two @-@ storey m@@ aus@@ ole@@ ums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living . &quot;
&quot; forget for a minute that there is a state of &quot; tranquility , &quot; if only a cart@@ el has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States . &quot;
&quot; despite the fact that Val@@ dez had become aware of the dangers of his work , Is@@ mail Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez ( 60 ) , a co @-@ founder and director of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , broke away with the guilt that he could not protect his friend . &quot;
he believes that two mis@@ understand@@ ings have contributed to the murder .
&quot; first , in February , the publication of an interview with Dam@@ asc@@ enes Lop@@ ez , a leader of one of the rival@@ ing cart@@ el frac@@ tions in war with Gu@@ z@@ man &apos;s sons . &quot;
&quot; this publication may have anno@@ yed the sons , they presum@@ ed gang@@ members bought each copy of the issue , as soon as they were delivered to newspaper ki@@ os@@ ks . &quot;
&quot; the second mistake was not to comp@@ el Val@@ dez after the confis@@ cation of another newspaper , which had published the same story , to leave the country on its own security . &quot;
Val@@ dez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .
he had survived so long that his friends and colleagues felt that he would always be there .
he worked as an experienced re@@ porter for Nor@@ o@@ este in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Ri@@ odo@@ ce and sold 50 US dollars .
&quot; in Sin@@ alo@@ a , &quot; it was impossible to run journ@@ alism without encounter@@ ing the drug addi@@ ct , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; with time , the newspaper gained a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased . &quot;
re@@ porters loved to be able to publish hard @-@ fitting investigations without fear of cens@@ orship and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dar@@ ed to treat .
&quot; eight years after the establishment of Ri@@ odo@@ ce , she received the prestigious &quot; Maria Mo@@ ors Cab@@ ot Award &quot; for her coverage in Latin America . &quot;
&quot; in the same year , Val@@ dez won the &apos; International Press Freedom Award &apos; of the Committee on the protection of journalists for his courage to prosec@@ ute the Mexican drug history , wherever it led . &quot;
he volunte@@ ered to be afraid .
&quot; I would like to continue living , &quot; he said at the time of the CP@@ J Award . &quot;
&quot; drug trafficking in Sin@@ alo@@ a &quot; is a way of life , &quot; he said last October in an interview with Rom@@ pe@@ vi@@ ento @-@ TV . &quot;
you have to take over the task which you will notice as a journalist - either that or you play the dum@@ my .
I don &apos;t want to be asked : &quot; what have you done in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ?
&quot; the Ri@@ odo@@ ce team mis@@ ses Val@@ dez , the fun bird , who was able to curse like a do@@ ck@@ worker , a friend who gener@@ ously embra@@ ced hu@@ gs and coun@@ sels , a teacher who knew how to survive . &quot;
they trusted in his routine .
he would always wear his hat .
&quot; he would always go to El Gu@@ ay@@ ab@@ o , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table . &quot;
&quot; then ask them , &quot; &quot; Was his love to the routine his destruction ? &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work , and stay alive . &quot;
&quot; they don &apos;t like it when you deal with their wives , their children , their clean stores , their home starting and landing ways &quot; &quot; to move drugs . &quot;
&quot; these things were not allowed , &quot; &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; the result is , even in the best times , a high degree of self @-@ cens@@ orship and self @-@ preservation . &quot;
trust his own instinc@@ ts .
&quot; if it smells wrong , stay away from it . &quot;
&quot; anger is , the editor of the Ri@@ odo@@ ce Andr@@ es Vill@@ ar@@ real said that &quot; smell is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with J@@ avier . &quot;
&quot; the old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sin@@ alo@@ a - just like in Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as , Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z , Gu@@ err@@ ero , and other states in which a po@@ ison@@ ous mixture of lu@@ cr@@ ative smu@@ g@@ gling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home . &quot;
the landscape is changing constantly .
&quot; in the room where the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce met for safety training , suddenly no cell phones were allowed . days before it was known that Spy@@ ware , which was sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico . &quot;
outside two polic@@ emen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .
they were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Ri@@ odo@@ ce in a four @-@ storey building in a middle @-@ class neighborhood of Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an .
&quot; half in the joke , some of the re@@ porters questioned whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the polic@@ emen who referred to the governor himself as not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; it has been months since the re@@ porters went to the mountain scenery , where the drug gangs are de facto control . &quot;
for the issue of this week Ri@@ odo@@ ce has fu@@ cked on three main stories .
there was the assass@@ ination of brother of the former famous ju@@ lio C@@ esar Cha@@ vez in Sin@@ alo@@ a .
they also had an expos@@ é to the state expendi@@ tures focused on the Gover@@ nor &apos;s hom@@ etown .
&quot; and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Cu@@ li@@ ac@@ an , a block from the Office of the Public Prosecutor , conducted a kidn@@ apping . &quot;
&quot; there was no official word about who was kidn@@ apped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ porter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politi@@ cian , who belonged to the ruling Institu@@ tional Revolution Party ( PR@@ I ) which ruled all the political levels almost the whole century . &quot;
&quot; recently , several PR@@ I govern@@ ors were accused of corruption in high @-@ cali@@ ber cases . &quot;
&quot; Vill@@ ar@@ real asked the re@@ porter to write about previous incidents in this pub , including one in which a son of &quot; El Chap@@ o &quot; Gu@@ z@@ man escaped a military attack . &quot;
&quot; only a few months earlier , readers would have considered the column of Val@@ dez as the most informed source about the ab@@ duction . &quot;
&quot; previously we would have known what happened , &quot; &quot; said Vill@@ ar@@ real , 46 , with the nick@@ name &quot; &quot; El Fl@@ aco &quot; &quot; because of its slim body stat@@ ure . &quot;
&quot; now , all channels of communication with our sources are broken . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez &apos;s office was dedicated to the storage space for signs and sti@@ ckers prot@@ esting against the mur@@ ders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press . &quot;
re@@ porter Mi@@ ri@@ am Ram@@ i@@ rez sn@@ apped a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist at the office of the Public Prosecutor .
&quot; Salvador Ad@@ ame disappeared three days after Val@@ dez had been killed , in the western state of Mich@@ o@@ ac@@ an . &quot;
&quot; a burnt body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is . &quot;
&quot; in the whole country , journalists have become lou@@ der by written in organized protests &quot; S@@ OS Press &quot; on walk@@ ways and buildings . &quot;
&quot; on that day , director Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez is in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judi@@ ci@@ ary in the Val@@ dez case . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with the governor of Sin@@ alo@@ a on the day after the assass@@ ination of Val@@ dez , Ram@@ i@@ rez accused the authorities of picking up journalists and letting them move because they told the truth . &quot;
&quot; she has since then asked that she is re@@ organized by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has viol@@ ated her objectiv@@ ity . &quot;
&quot; Val@@ dez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , government officials and a valid society . &quot;
&quot; in his last book &quot; Nar@@ co @-@ Journ@@ alism , &quot; he wrote that re@@ porters were not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders from politicians and security forces , who were infected with organised crime under a blanket . &quot;
&quot; last year , the media group &quot; Arti@@ cul@@ o 19 &quot; assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists by the police and officials . &quot;
&quot; in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth , &quot; &quot; said Ram@@ i@@ rez . &quot;
&quot; obviously , the kill@@ ings have a deter@@ rent effect . &quot;
no one for@@ gets the death of the blo@@ gger Maria Elizabeth M@@ aci@@ as in the northern border state of Tam@@ au@@ lip@@ as six years ago .
her body was found along with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Z@@ et@@ as Kart@@ ell : &quot; here I am because of my reports .
a computer keyboard and headphones are located next to their separate head .
some branches have chosen to close like the newspaper El Nor@@ te in the northern border state Chi@@ hu@@ ah@@ ua after the assass@@ ination of correspon@@ dent Mi@@ ros@@ lav Bre@@ ach in March .
others continue as El Man@@ ana of Nu@@ evo Lar@@ edo did after the assass@@ ination of its director in 2004 .
&quot; in 2010 , the Di@@ ario de Ci@@ u@@ dad Ju@@ are@@ z directed publicly to the drug cart@@ els with an editorial on the front page with the title &quot; What do you want of us ? &quot; &quot;
some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .
it is a painful decision .
&quot; it is hard to find work in exile , and they still watch the streets and search for dangers . &quot;
&quot; and sometimes they are hun@@ ted , as evi@@ dently the photographer Ru@@ ben Esp@@ in@@ osa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Ver@@ ac@@ ru@@ z . &quot;
&quot; for those who remain behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with ris@@ ky decisions . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bar@@ ra , who once wanted to be a poet , ad@@ mits that drug trafficking was frigh@@ tened . &quot;
&quot; Mexico goes to hell , and so I became re@@ porter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at midnight on the last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Ri@@ odo@@ ce sat on the side@@ walk in front of the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to sum up . &quot;
a number of shooting companies with belt riv@@ alities and security forces near the seaside resort Maz@@ at@@ lan had left 19 confirmed dead .
the war escal@@ ated as promised by a series of Kart@@ ell messages in the region .
&quot; from the cur@@ b edge , they released the news on the website of Ri@@ odo@@ ce on mobile phone . &quot;
the title page had to be changed the next day .
si@@ r@@ ens stayed nearby - another shooting in the area .
Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were ready .
&quot; if they were afraid at all , they didn &apos;t show it . &quot;
&quot; under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to all of Sin@@ alo@@ a , the staff of Ri@@ odo@@ ce followed his tracks . &quot;
&quot; how can you only think of closing it , &quot; said Bo@@ j@@ or@@ qu@@ ez , &quot; if on the same day , where J@@ avier was murdered , the intern@@ s asked me to send them to the road . &quot;
din@@ osau@@ rs used cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to ev@@ ade his enemies
&quot; at first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frigh@@ tening . &quot;
researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible r@@ ash@@ or@@ ns of a Canadian min@@ ers have been so well received that experts described it as &quot; Mon@@ a Lisa of Dinosau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; it was so well received that they could even find out that his sc@@ aly skin was of red@@ dish brown , and they said she had something of a &quot; &quot; troubled past &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report in the journal &quot; Current Biology &quot; described it as &quot; the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r , ever found , and one of the best din@@ osau@@ rs in the world . &quot;
the fossil is a newly discovered type of No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier which lived in the middle of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .
&quot; his amaz@@ ingly well @-@ preserved condition has start@@ led researchers , who describe it as &quot; truly remarkable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to reports in National Ge@@ ographic , the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous is the best preserved fossil of its kind . &quot;
&quot; Sha@@ wn Funk found it in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada . &quot;
&quot; he met something out of the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely . &quot;
the fossi@@ ls discovered by him were sent to the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ e@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; during the next six years , they spent the next six years revealing the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,@@ 100 kg ) of crude oil . &quot;
&quot; after all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed . &quot;
&quot; if you only blin@@ king a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it was sleeping , &quot; &quot; said the main author Cal@@ eb Brown , scientist at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum , where the creature is to be seen . &quot;
it will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved din@@ osau@@ rs - the Mon@@ a Lisa of the din@@ osau@@ rs .
&quot; researchers have found that this her@@ bi@@ vor@@ ous , even though it is covered with a arm@@ or and resembles a changing tank , probably threatened by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
&quot; the heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r used a red and white cam@@ ou@@ f@@ lage to hide from predat@@ ors , and used a shiel@@ ding technique known as counter @-@ protection , which is also used by many modern animals . &quot;
&quot; this would have allowed it to better blend in its surroundings and to ev@@ ade its enemies , experts say that it was threatened by major din@@ osau@@ rs . &quot;
the 110 million years old creature from the No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier family made head@@ lines in May and is now exhibited at the Royal Ty@@ r@@ rel@@ l Museum of Pal@@ ae@@ ont@@ ology .
&quot; researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta mark@@ mit@@ ch@@ elli according to the Museum technician Mark Mit@@ ch@@ ell , one of a team that has spent more than 7.@@ 000 hours to uncover it carefully . &quot;
the amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mit@@ ch@@ ell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of sheds and arm@@ or over his body .
&quot; they discovered the counter @-@ sh@@ ading , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the head of the creature was darker than its under@@ side . &quot;
&quot; although the counter @-@ sh@@ ading is common , the results are surprising since the size of Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta far exceeds that of today living animals . &quot;
it suggests that the din@@ osau@@ rs were driven by enough pressure by car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs that evolution favor@@ ed the conce@@ al@@ ment of confrontation as a means of survival .
&quot; but most contemporary animals that use the counter @-@ shade - think of deer , zeb@@ ras or ar@@ ma@@ dil@@ los - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loo@@ t , which signals that this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier was exposed to a real fight for survival . &quot;
&quot; strong predat@@ or behavior on a massive , heavily arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r show how dangerous the din@@ osau@@ rs of the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous period must have been , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the chemical analysis of organic compounds in her scales also shows that the skin of the din@@ osau@@ r was bay .
&quot; scientists continue to examine the animal on clu@@ es about his life , including its con@@ served bow@@ el content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal . &quot;
&quot; they believe that the din@@ osau@@ r , when he died , got into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea . &quot;
&quot; at that time , Alber@@ ta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today . &quot;
&quot; this No@@ dos@@ au@@ rier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved sc@@ aly skin , but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , &quot; Brown said . &quot;
the result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chal@@ k time .
&quot; you don &apos;t need to use much imagination to re@@ construct it . if you just shoot a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that he is asleep . &quot;
&quot; the C@@ ret@@ ac@@ eous Age was a time when huge ther@@ opo@@ ds , car@@ ni@@ vor@@ ous din@@ osau@@ rs , who stood on two legs , went through the earth . &quot;
&quot; although the king of them , the Tyran@@ n@@ osau@@ rus Re@@ x , lived millions of years after Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta , the arm@@ oured din@@ osau@@ r was hun@@ ted by some of his terri@@ fying ancestors . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Ac@@ ro@@ can@@ th@@ osau@@ rus , a 38 foot ( 1@@ 1,5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters . &quot;
&quot; the scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Bor@@ e@@ al@@ op@@ el@@ ta sank after death in the sea and was m@@ um@@ i@@ fied in mud . &quot;
&quot; the creature was found by Sha@@ wn Funk , when he was buried in the Sun@@ cor Mill@@ enium Mine near Fort Mc@@ Mur@@ ray in the north of Alber@@ ta , Canada , on 21 March 2011 . &quot;
&quot; according to the museum , it is the best @-@ preserved din@@ osau@@ r of the world , including skin and arm@@ or , and is completely from the mu@@ zzle to the hip . &quot;
&quot; the creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,@@ 300 kg ) . &quot;
it contained two 20 @-@ inch long spi@@ kes which ra@@ ged from his shoulders .
the researchers believe that the ar@@ mor@@ ed her@@ bi@@ vor@@ es were sw@@ amped by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .
but the underwater crew of the din@@ osau@@ r kept his arm@@ or in exquisite detail .
the fossi@@ li@@ zed remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hau@@ tre@@ ste still cover hol@@ lowed ar@@ mor@@ ed ar@@ mor@@ ed plat@@ e@@ plates along the din@@ osau@@ r
&quot; as Michael G@@ res@@ h@@ ko wrote for National Ge@@ ographic , such a level of preservation is as &apos; rare as a win in the lot@@ tery . &quot;
&quot; the more I consider it , the more conf@@ using it becomes . &quot;
pet@@ ri@@ fied remains of the skin still cover the b@@ ump@@ y arm@@ oured plates that carry the skull of the animal .
&quot; his right foref@@ oot is on his side , his five fingers are spread upward . &quot;
I can count the scales on his sole .
in the thunder@@ storm : mass incar@@ n@@ ate on A@@ 8 : many wounded
violent accident on Thursday evening on the A@@ 8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass incar@@ nation .
&quot; there are numerous wounded , kilometres long stands - and G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
&quot; on the Stuttgart @-@ Munich highway ( A@@ 8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass incar@@ nation on Thursday afternoon . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , at 17@@ .00 hrs there were almost 30 vehicles between the jun@@ ctions of Adel@@ z@@ hausen and O@@ del@@ z@@ hausen ( district of A@@ ich@@ ach @-@ Fried@@ berg ) , among them trucks . &quot;
&quot; at first , there are no indications of the exact number of the injured . &quot;
&quot; it was a matter of mild to moderate violations , said a police spokes@@ man . &quot;
a large number of emergency vehicles were charged at the accident site .
the A@@ 8 was completely closed in the direction of Munich .
&quot; in the direction of driving direction Munich , there was an approximately ten kilometer long re@@ sta@@ u . &quot;
&quot; as reported by an A@@ Z re@@ porter , it also happened on the counter @-@ road to massive han@@ di@@ caps - by numerous G@@ aff@@ er . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade noted the characteristics of the car anch@@ ors that have now to be reck@@ oned with sensitive pen@@ alties .
&quot; shortly after 18 : 45 p.m. , another accident occurred on the A@@ 8 , this time between Augsburg and D@@ asing . &quot;
there was a collision between a car transpor@@ ter and a passenger car .
a rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .
Deutsche Bahn : group tests &quot; Comfort Check @-@ in &quot;
it &apos;s a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : you are sitting in the train and sleeping .
or one is deep@@ ened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .
and then : buff@@ f .
comes the conductor and w@@ akes up an impro@@ mp@@ tu or sn@@ aps the passenger in the middle of the workflow .
ticket control .
but the times of interrup@@ tions are over soon .
the Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the head@@ less ticket control .
you simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and vali@@ date the ticket .
&quot; currently , a test run runs on two routes . &quot;
&quot; if the offer comes , we extend it . &quot;
&quot; it will then be available in Germany at the beginning of next year on many more remote traffic routes in Germany , &quot; &quot; said a railway speaker . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; comfort Check @-@ in &quot; &quot; lists the ticket de@@ valuation without a conductor . &quot;
&quot; in order to be able to use them , however , some requirements have to be fulfilled : you need a smartphone or tablet . &quot;
and you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway .
&quot; it also has to be purchased via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is anyway the most convenient way of booking a ticket . &quot;
and last but not least you need a seat reservation .
&quot; for the &quot; comfort check @-@ in &quot; works : one climbs into the train , calls his ticket under &quot; My Tickets . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with the test clients , a button for electronic de@@ valuation will be displayed . &quot;
the train atten@@ de@@ es get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is on the train and has taken the booked seat Y .
the train atten@@ dant at the ticket control at Platz Y knows that there is a passenger sitting there with an already vali@@ dated online ticket .
&quot; so you can continue to sleep , continue to work , keep silent . &quot;
&quot; check @-@ in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should use the passengers . &quot;
&quot; those who want to travel relaxed without ticket control by our train crew , check out the DB Navigator yourself . &quot;
&quot; this enables passengers to make their travel time in the train more personal , &quot; says Michael Peter@@ son , Marketing Director of DB Fern@@ verkehr . &quot;
&quot; second plus : &quot; &quot; and our employees have more time than today to respond to the individual customer needs . &quot;
&quot; those who often travel by train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest anno@@ y@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; often one has , in any case , one of the contribut@@ ors not all the documents needed for the validation of online tickets . &quot;
either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to provide is missing .
&quot; the result is endless discussions between train atten@@ dant and passenger , which leads to bad mood in the section or large room and delays in the control of your own ticket and takes the Schaff@@ ner at the end the time to take care of other matters . &quot;
only a small number of test@@ ers can use the new service .
and that &apos;s just on the connections ICE 9@@ 15 Dortmund @-@ Stuttgart and ICE 9@@ 12 Stuttgart @-@ Essen .
additional numbers on the same route are not un@@ locked yet .
how an activ@@ ist came to learn the answer to the question : &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot;
&quot; on 9 August 2014 , Br@@ itt@@ any Fer@@ rel@@ l was sha@@ ken to its core . &quot;
&quot; just one day after she had arrived in New York City , the apartment she rented in St. Louis was sitting on the bed of an air@@ b@@ n@@ b apartment she rented and sc@@ rolled through Facebook on her phone . &quot;
she stum@@ bled over a post by someone from the High School .
&quot; the police had just killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old child , and it still lies on the road , &quot; &quot; said it there . &quot;
&quot; confused , since nobody else posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . &quot;
a user with the Hand@@ le @ The@@ e@@ Phar@@ o@@ ah was constantly rescu@@ ed on their tim@@ eline .
&quot; the ra@@ pper from the area of St. Louis was to twe@@ ets the death of Michael Brown , an un@@ armed black 18 @-@ year @-@ old , who was killed by a white polic@@ eman in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , Mo . &quot;
he posted an image of Brown &apos;s lifel@@ ess body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours .
&quot; that &apos;s wild , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l thought . &quot;
but death was nothing new for them and their community .
she left her cell phone to return to T@@ we@@ ets on the Can@@ field @-@ Drive later in the evening .
&quot; there were photos of police tape and people crying out , and a man who claimed to be a father &apos;s father who wore a sign with the inscription : &quot; F@@ erg@@ us@@ on police just killed my un@@ armed son ! &quot;
she watched a live feed where a polic@@ eman stood in front of a group of prot@@ esters with a bark@@ ing dog .
&quot; in another video she said , another polic@@ eman escaped his gun and cried , &quot; &quot; I &apos;m going to kill you ... animals all kill . &quot;
&quot; this is not usual , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l to her statement . &quot;
this is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical .
at this moment I felt shi@@ vering .
I was angry and cried . &quot;
she booked a return flight and went home the next day .
after the landing at 11 o &apos;clock she took her 6 @-@ year @-@ old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on the next morning .
&quot; what happened in the following three years with Fer@@ rel@@ l and F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , is the theme of a new documentary film called &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the cinem@@ as from the 11th century onwards . &quot;
&quot; it is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consist of the perspective of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers . &quot;
&quot; as Fer@@ rel@@ l with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown , went to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on , the two talked a conversation that they had countless times before this morning &apos; over the black experience and the black state . &quot;
&quot; you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? &quot; &quot; she reminded her of what she said . &quot;
we are now going to F@@ erg@@ us@@ on because the police killed a 18 @-@ year @-@ old boy and that wasn &apos;t right .
&quot; I could not take her along , &quot; Fer@@ rel@@ l said later . &quot;
what has happened today is a climax of what happened in the past .
it must know it and see it and be raised in it .
&quot; it must be well developed , not only activ@@ ism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves . &quot;
&quot; even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally do not experience a blat@@ ant racism , she is no different from the next black women &apos;s child . &quot;
I feel I would be a bad service to keep them far away .
&quot; the first stop when they arrived in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on was located at the South Flor@@ iss@@ ant Road , a place opposite the police authority which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non @-@ charge of Officer Dar@@ ren Wilson . &quot;
&quot; there Fer@@ rel@@ l and her daughter joined together with a local business owner , who made lunch . &quot;
they prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstr@@ ators .
slowly a new type of activ@@ ism began to take shape for Fer@@ rel@@ l &apos;s form .
&quot; my activ@@ ism was totally changed after 9 August , &quot; she said , and noticed that she was a student at the University of Mis@@ sour@@ i @-@ St. Louis , President of the Min@@ ority Student Nur@@ ses Association and focused on food justice and health ine@@ qualities in black communities . &quot;
&quot; I had no experience in organising .
it is all come . &quot;
&quot; weeks later Fer@@ rel@@ l met Sab@@ a@@ ah Fol@@ ay@@ an during an evening demonstration , one of the co @-@ directors of the film . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an said she and her cam@@ er@@ aman Lucas Al@@ var@@ ado @-@ Far@@ ra@@ r just wanted to &quot; document &quot; what happened .
&quot; a question came about Fer@@ rel@@ l : &quot; &quot; do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? &quot;
&quot; this skep@@ ticism was nour@@ ished by countless cases of people , often by wh@@ ites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resili@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; as Fol@@ ay@@ an recently stated in an interview , &quot; &quot; We had heard that people who were born and raised in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently . &quot;
&quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an had already collabor@@ ated with the former co @-@ director Dam@@ on Davis , an artist from the area known for his activ@@ ism around To@@ de@@ stra@@ kt in@@ mates . &quot;
&quot; his commitment brought Fer@@ rel@@ l closer to the project , along with six other locals followed the team of &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; in the years after Brow@@ ning &apos;s shooting . &quot;
&quot; this documentary is not someone who speaks to us or talks to us . we &apos;re talking , &quot; &quot; Davis said . &quot;
&quot; that was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , for so I will be represented . &quot;
&quot; the goal was not to focus on Ferr@@ ara &apos;s experience - to show that the movement &quot; is not a mes@@ si@@ ah leader but a community that comes together , &quot; Fol@@ ay@@ an said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film . &quot;
&quot; as a result , documents from &quot; Wh@@ ose Stre@@ ets ? &quot; are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferr@@ is &apos;s life , as they love and marry their wife . &quot;
&quot; I felt like naked , &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , laugh@@ ing when she saw the finished product for the first time . &quot;
but I have understood that there must be some vulner@@ ability in this work and in the human@@ ization of black people .
&quot; in addition , Ferr@@ is &apos;s history repe@@ ats the role of black gay women in the wider Black @-@ Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter movement . &quot;
&quot; two of the three founders of the movement , following the killing of the black teen@@ ager Tra@@ y@@ von Martin in 2012 , identified the film &quot; &quot; Black@@ live Mat@@ ter &quot; &quot; in social media , identifying themselves as gay . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether , &quot; &quot; said Fer@@ rel@@ l , &quot; &quot; and so we are constantly fighting on different fron@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . &quot;
Fol@@ ay@@ an agreed to note that &quot; the movement is really held by black women and many black women .
&quot; however , it insi@@ sts that &quot; this is not an affir@@ mati@@ ver type of action , &quot; in which Fer@@ rel@@ l was chosen as the heart of the film on account of her identity . &quot;
&quot; she was the person who sh@@ ook this energy , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it is not a coincidence , although it was at the forefront because in a life at these cross@@ ings as a black gay woman there is so much on the game . &quot;
you can feel their energy through the screen . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the news cameras in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist . &quot;
Fer@@ rel@@ l is on prob@@ ation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration .
it describes the socio @-@ political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : &quot; chaos . &quot;
nevertheless she cl@@ ings to a chant and she feels obliged to this memory since she went on the road three years ago in F@@ erg@@ us@@ on .
it is our duty to fight for our freedom .
it is our duty to win .
we have to love and support one another .
we have nothing to lose - except our chains . &quot;

&quot; but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian prec@@ inct , since the first presentation in 2009 , divi@@ des people into pro@@ pon@@ ents and opponents . &quot;
&quot; cold , the subject hardly leaves one . &quot;
the topic is also discussed on our Facebook page &quot; Volks@@ fre@@ und Bit@@ burg . &quot;
&quot; while the one to the bit gallery say , &quot; That would be a dream &quot; ( Anja Becker ) or &quot; That would be real class &quot; ( Nicole Schau@@ ste ) , comes from the other side : &quot; doesn &apos;t need a person &quot; ( Sig@@ gi B@@ etzen ) or quite simply : &quot; meg@@ al@@ om@@ ania ! &quot; ( Lars Schol@@ z ) . &quot;
&quot; while the pro@@ pon@@ ents build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city , of which the other businesses benefit , the opponents fear that then the pedestrian prec@@ inct is bleeding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer &apos;s market hall stands , in which 13 direct marketing offers its products . &quot;
at the beginning of the construction work will be finished .
&quot; the Galerie @-@ makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - in addition to the Bed@@ a @-@ Platz , with the possibility to sit outside . &quot;
Simone Zimmer : &quot; we have been shopping in the farmer &apos;s market almost weekly for many years .
&quot; mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the house@@ wives , again and again very gladly . &quot;
also the but@@ cher &apos;s shop we discovered for us .
we would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer .
&quot; in other cities , there is that too . &quot;
especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . &quot;
Gerd D@@ ens@@ ing : &quot; whether direct marketing is moving in a market hall in the gallery comes to the amount of rent .
&quot; but this should not be low in the new project . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; Eva K@@ ili@@ c : &quot; &quot; why shopping palaces in Bit@@ burg ? &quot;
&quot; whether it &apos;s clothing , shoes , dru@@ g@@ stores or supermarkets : I think that &apos;s unnecessary . &quot;
there is enough of this in our city .
&quot; you see , how many stores are empty here - some for months and years . &quot;
&quot; but since there is not yet a regular weekly market , it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains . &quot;
&quot; after all , the goods offered there are fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap at the top . &quot;
&quot; as you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rented equipment is often not portable for retailers . &quot;
&quot; it is a shame , special business@@ s almost no longer exist and what is left of it will probably disappear . &quot;
wolf F@@ andel : &quot; a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me .
and the gallery does not fit into Bit@@ burg .
above all : where should the farmer &apos;s market hall be used during the construction period ?
the old E@@ de@@ ka would be the solution - even in the long run when the bit gallery actually comes .
or does the spec@@ tra@@ l bit gallery already manage to drive all shops out of Bit@@ burg ?
George Mar@@ quet : &quot; it simply won &apos;t work .
&quot; and a shopping center , which is empty , no one needs . &quot;
&quot; in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer &apos;s market , instead of this gallery . &quot;
&quot; but for a farmer &apos;s market hall , thanks to the ins@@ an@@ ely many - as I find - sen@@ sel@@ ess building projects in Bit@@ burg are no longer a place . &quot;
&quot; once the farmer &apos;s market hall is destroyed , a piece of culture will disappear again . &quot;
a suitable simil@@ arity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mann@@ ings DNA
&quot; in the middle of the room of the Fri@@ d@@ man Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost in@@ conspic@@ uous - hanging on cables from the ceiling . &quot;
the 30 portraits were created by He@@ ather De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg from W@@ angen @-@ T@@ up@@ pers and hair@@ cuts sent to her by Chelsea Mann@@ ing .
Mann@@ ing sent excer@@ pts from Fort Le@@ aven@@ worth prison where the former intelligence analy@@ st ban@@ ished a 35 @-@ year prison sentence after she publicly tra@@ ded diplomatic reports on the Wiki@@ Le@@ aks website .
&quot; the new exhibition , opened on August 2 , is called &quot; &quot; A Bec@@ oming resem@@ b@@ lance &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; she is the product of two years correspondence between De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose discipline combined her expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Mann@@ ing , a trans@@ gender woman and ground@@ breaking dis@@ sident whose conviction has been transformed by Barack Obama , when he had only three days in his office . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg has an algorith@@ mic analysis of DNA extracted by Mann@@ ing and created out of the 30 portraits , how someone could look with these gen@@ om@@ ic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determin@@ ism of these interpretations - but also for identity . &quot;
&quot; Mann@@ ing , who was born as Brad@@ ley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since pu@@ ber@@ ty , was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the es@@ pi@@ onage law , computer fraud and theft . &quot;
&quot; her image was supp@@ ressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photo - a gra@@ ined black @-@ white sel@@ f@@ ie in which Mann@@ ing was obviously sitting on a driver &apos;s seat and wearing a plat@@ inum @-@ blonde wig - with which she was associated . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg came just about the great success of her 2012 project &apos; Stran@@ ger Visi@@ ons &apos; . &quot;
&quot; in this , the artist produced portraits of for@@ en@@ sic art@@ ef@@ acts like cigarette but@@ cher and ch@@ ewing gum by extrac@@ ting the DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of how these people could look . &quot;
that was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .
&quot; they conducted an interview with Chelsea Mann@@ ing while in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , &quot; explained De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg at a press review of the new exhibition . &quot;
&quot; and she was not able to attend this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of a DNA . &quot;
&quot; in the course of two years , the artist and her incar@@ cer@@ ated M@@ use exchanged several letters . &quot;
&quot; they even created a cartoon titled &quot; &quot; Supp@@ ressed Images &quot; &quot; illustrated by Sho@@ ili Kan@@ ung@@ o , who fores@@ aw a future where the president would transform Chel@@ seas &apos;s judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally . &quot;
&quot; Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published , asking Mann@@ ing &apos;s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in K@@ ans@@ as , was a welcome kind of happy coincidence . &quot;
&quot; there is also a bit deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Tru@@ mp has a war against in@@ forman@@ ts from the government camp and against trans@@ gender troops to find new twe@@ et@@ able ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should rec@@ tify . &quot;
&quot; when De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that &quot; things happen for a certain reason . &quot;
&quot; in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Mann@@ ing demanded with her super@@ large signature underneath ( the &quot; i &quot; in her sur@@ name is equipped with a heart ) an end to &quot; automatic frag@@ mentation , whose foundation was gender , race , sexu@@ ality and culture . &quot;
&quot; on the opposite wall its mit@@ och@@ on@@ dri@@ al DNA sequence is written in pencil , a thous@@ and@@ th of Cs and Gs and As . &quot;
&quot; De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg hoped to show by including the 200 letters ( or nucle@@ oti@@ des after the highly developed scientific en@@ cyclo@@ pedia of the artist ) , how amaz@@ ingly similar , at least in biological sense , we are all . &quot;
&quot; what people will hopefully take with it is that our gen@@ ome does not care who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg , whose video works from 2007 , Sp@@ uri@@ ous Mem@@ ories , also to be seen . &quot;
&quot; DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . &quot;
&quot; the last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in a separate room , is a page from the above @-@ mentioned comic novel . &quot;
it shows Mann@@ ing how it appears with a hands @-@ free hands from the discipline of discipline of the United States such as King Kong .
&quot; when they cold your speech , then they have won , &quot; &quot; it says . &quot;
&quot; so keep your mouth shut . &quot;
&quot; it came directly from a letter she wrote to me , &quot; &quot; said the artist , greeting from Philadelphia . &quot;
I still get go@@ os@@ eb@@ um@@ ps when I talk about it .
&quot; Mann@@ ing has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when it was supposed to do it , it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks , from their own gen@@ om@@ ic simulations , which rally like hor@@ des of prot@@ esters . &quot;
&quot; this was also targeted like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 &quot; 2 , Mann@@ ings St@@ atur ) , in which their genetic hap@@ lo@@ groups were written with pencil . &quot;
&quot; in the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , &quot; said De@@ we@@ y @-@ Hag@@ borg by the portraits . &quot;
&quot; I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also stuck behind its liberation . &quot;
Professor of the University of Nor@@ th@@ western and an employee of Oxford University because of killing
&quot; a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Nor@@ th@@ western University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who will be looked for as susp@@ ects after a man was stab@@ bed in a luxurious flat in Chicago with fatal injuries . &quot;
&quot; on Monday , W@@ yn@@ d@@ ham La@@ them@@ ( 42 ) and Andrew War@@ ren ( 56 ) issued warran@@ ts for murder because of murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Tr@@ ent@@ on H. James Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , as the acts of the National Court of Cook County show . &quot;
&quot; the documents say that Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au , 26 , died after several stit@@ ches . &quot;
a joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the corp@@ se was discovered on 27 July .
&quot; officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body . &quot;
&quot; Corn@@ ell @-@ Dur@@ an@@ le@@ au was declared dead in the place of events , and det@@ ectiv@@ es investigate the stit@@ ches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two susp@@ ects said officials . &quot;
&quot; since 2007 , La@@ din has been Professor of Micro@@ biology and Immun@@ ology at Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; Alan K. Cub@@ ist , vice @-@ president for university relations , said in an e @-@ mail statement that La@@ them had now been in danger and excluded from entering the campus of Nor@@ th@@ western University . &quot;
&quot; this is now a criminal case being investigated by the competent authorities , and Nor@@ th@@ western University collabor@@ ates with this investigation , &quot; &quot; said cub@@ bage . &quot;
War@@ ren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .
a speaker at the University and Som@@ er@@ ville College said in an e @-@ mail statement that &quot; we are in contact with the police in the UK and are ready to help the U.S. investig@@ ative authorities in any way possible .
the statement added that War@@ ren &apos;s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .
&quot; chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Administration , Anthony Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , said he strongly urge the susp@@ ects to face the authorities . &quot;
&quot; the police have an idea of their where@@ ab@@ outs , and our efforts to locate them reinforce , &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said that local , regional and national authorities will help find the susp@@ ects . &quot;
&quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi , the police received a call from the Building Administrator of the Grand Plaza building , which had just received a mysterious tip that said that something happened in apartment 10@@ 08 . &quot;
the police described the scene as very cruel .
&quot; Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi said it was unclear , whether the incident took place on July 27th . &quot;
it was confirmed by security cameras that ladies and War@@ ren were in the building .
&quot; we believe that Professor L@@ ath@@ am and the victim had a relationship , &quot; &quot; said Gu@@ gli@@ el@@ mi . &quot;
&quot; the management team at Grand Plaza published an explanation to the residents : &quot; &quot; the police are currently working on the tim@@ eline and the victim &apos;s background and resear@@ ches a variety of motives , including a possible home event . &quot;
&quot; we will finish the WA@@ DA road@@ map in the near future &quot; - Russian Deputy Prime
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital@@ y Mut@@ ko said it won &apos;t take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( WA@@ DA ) will be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency ( R@@ US@@ A@@ DA ) .
&quot; at a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road@@ map , R@@ US@@ A@@ DA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with U@@ K@@ AD ( UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ) . &quot;
&quot; the WA@@ DA road@@ map was updated in this respect , &quot; &quot; said Mut@@ ko on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; the PM commented on the second part of the WA@@ DA road@@ map to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for the replacement of R@@ US@@ A@@ DA and was recently published on the organization &apos;s website . &quot;
&quot; according to Mut@@ ko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia . &quot;
&quot; everything was announced , everything is implemented . &quot;
&quot; the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) and WA@@ DA in the near future , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; however , one of the criteria listed in the list shows that the Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WA@@ DA by the Canadian lawyer Richard Mc@@ L@@ aren about publicly funded dop@@ ing in Russian sports . &quot;
&quot; in terms of the matter , Mut@@ ko said : &quot; &quot; we carry out the investigation , because our anti @-@ dop@@ ing system has made a mistake . &quot;
all measures have been implemented .
&quot; but there were no government programmes , and we will not admit that which does not exist . &quot;
&quot; Mut@@ ko &apos;s words agreed with those of Vital@@ y Sm@@ ir@@ nov , head of the independent Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing commission . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with the Russian sales agency r@@ sport at the start of the day Sm@@ ir@@ nov had problems of the past in Russian anti @-@ dop@@ ing organizations , but added : &quot; we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . &quot;
&quot; no one tried to accept this report un@@ condition@@ ally , &quot; &quot; added Sm@@ ir@@ nov . &quot;
R@@ US@@ A@@ DA was ruled out in November 2015 in the course of dop@@ ing sc@@ and@@ als by WA@@ DA by the implementation of dop@@ ing controls in Russia .
&quot; however , you were allowed to plan and coordinate testing under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti @-@ D@@ oping ( U@@ K@@ AD ) . &quot;
&quot; after a visit to Moscow &apos;s headquarters in Moscow in July , WA@@ DA Director General Oli@@ vier Nig@@ gli explained that R@@ US@@ A@@ DA moves &quot; in the right direction &quot; to be used again . &quot;
Al@@ di does not sell eggs anymore
these divided the company groups .
&quot; it was a mere precau@@ tion , it could not be assumed by any health impair@@ ment , it was said in the message . &quot;
&quot; from now on , only eggs should be delivered to Al@@ di , which have been demon@@ stra@@ bly tested negative to fi@@ pron@@ il@@ ene anti @-@ lice . &quot;
Al@@ di wants to make clarity and transparency to his customers .
the start @-@ ups that will help your company do not become the next U@@ ber
&quot; A@@ my Er@@ ret@@ t wanted to measure luck with your e @-@ commerce start @-@ up , but the p@@ olls didn &apos;t work . &quot;
&quot; answers were often vag@@ ue , little helpful or - even worse - frau@@ dul@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; and even if you promised anonym@@ ity , some workers did not trust the process . &quot;
&quot; there was simply never consistency and objectiv@@ ity , &quot; said Er@@ ret@@ t , who runs the 75 @-@ person San Francisco e @-@ commerce Hair Care Company Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed . &quot;
she sum@@ mon@@ ed people from the outside for help .
a new Human Resource Start @-@ up race is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .
&quot; by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , provide special groups and demographic groups , to offer employees anonym@@ ity and gri@@ ev@@ ance hot@@ lines , and in some cases allow whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers to circum@@ vent the C @-@ Suite managers and contact the Board of Directors . &quot;
&quot; you now have tools such as Stra@@ va and Fit@@ bit for tracking your health , but where is Fit@@ bit for your company ? &quot; said Jim Bar@@ nett , co @-@ founder and Chief Executive of Red@@ wood City Start @-@ up G@@ lin@@ t , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement . &quot;
Er@@ ret@@ t said she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with G@@ lin@@ t won .
&quot; in addition to the Sn@@ ap p@@ olls and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat map of the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which leaders have low approval results - so you can drill down , why . &quot;
&quot; companies are coming to see that they will remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you will not be the next U@@ ber , who has been involved in sc@@ and@@ als since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of har@@ ass@@ ment in which those who have spoken will be punished . &quot;
&quot; for start @-@ ups like G@@ lin@@ t , this wish is an overview of a lu@@ cr@@ ative business opportunity . &quot;
&quot; global governance , regulation and compliance sector could have more than $ 1@@ 18.@@ 7 billion by 2020 , following the financial technical website Let &apos;s Talk Pay@@ ments . &quot;
&quot; Den@@ ver , Colorado , Start @-@ up Con@@ ver@@ cent , the company helps to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in the beginning of this year amid the U@@ ber @-@ F@@ all in Mis@@ cell@@ re@@ dit . &quot;
&quot; Con@@ ver@@ cent has nearly 600 clients including Air@@ b@@ n@@ b , Microsoft and Tes@@ la . &quot;
U@@ ber recently registered as a client .
&quot; like G@@ lin@@ t , Con@@ ver@@ cent lets companies send customised &quot; pulse &quot; surveys , collect sensitive responses in real time and view the heat maps of your problem areas . &quot;
it also offers an anonymous SMS @-@ hot@@ line where employees can report bad behavior .
&quot; and when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board . &quot;
&quot; the Court of Public Opinion has captured the regul@@ ators , &quot; said Patrick Qu@@ in@@ lan , founder and managing director of Con@@ ver@@ cent . &quot;
&quot; if a company is found that treats its employees badly or beha@@ ves un@@ ethical , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boy@@ cot@@ t , employee turnover and complaints , said Qu@@ in@@ lan . &quot;
&quot; Ru@@ by Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , Con@@ ver@@ cent has used for over a year to ensure employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate headquarters . &quot;
&quot; in the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a phone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously . &quot;
&quot; it was often a in@@ timi@@ dation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vit@@ rano , Ru@@ by TU@@ ES@@ DA@@ Y@@ S General Co@@ uns@@ el , who said there was no good way to track the complaints of employees . &quot;
&quot; now , as the company uses Con@@ ver@@ cent , problems that have previously been hidden by executives who were in offices in cities or states could be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , har@@ ass@@ ment or unfair tra@@ ine@@ es@@ hip . &quot;
&quot; I can approach this holistic , 360 degree view into the experience with employment , &quot; said Vit@@ rano , who manages the Risk Management Group of Ru@@ by Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; and we protect our shareholders from employment disputes . &quot;
&quot; companies started taking Eth@@ ics , Val@@ ues and Emplo@@ ye@@ es &apos; Com@@ mit@@ ment in 2002 , after Arthur Ander@@ sen &apos;s accounting firm collap@@ sed for ethical violations by the En@@ ron sc@@ andal , Qu@@ in@@ lan said . &quot;
but it took until the &quot; social media came to their right &quot; that companies recognized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry online .
&quot; before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , &quot; he said . &quot;
both G@@ lin@@ t and Con@@ ver@@ cent provide your software as a service and charge the companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .
it is a business model and a chance that allows the approval of venture capital investors who have supported both start @-@ ups .
&quot; cent received $ 10 million in funding in February by companies such as S@@ apphire Vent@@ ures and T@@ ola Capital , with which the total capital was raised to $ 47 million . &quot;
&quot; gl@@ itz@@ ers secured $ 10 million in November by B@@ ess@@ emer Venture Partners , bringing total funding to $ 60 million . &quot;
&quot; these investments are hardly surprising given the connected nature of companies , culture and venture capital . &quot;
&quot; there is a growing complex of research , which shows that today &apos;s employees are expecting more from their jobs than before . &quot;
&quot; in competitive markets such as Si@@ licon Valley , high sal@@ aries and interesting projects are only bets . &quot;
employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .
&quot; if people are happy to be in a company that is worth their votes and that the work you do is worth , then they feel more oblig@@ ated to make this company successful , &quot; said Nina Mc@@ Queen , Vice President of Global Ben@@ ef@@ its and Emplo@@ ye@@ e Experience at Link@@ ed@@ In , which uses both Con@@ ver@@ cent and G@@ lin@@ t . &quot;
investors reach Ren@@ di@@ ten when their portfolio companies operate well . companies operate well if employees are committed and committed .
&quot; when the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase engagement and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support . &quot;
the data on employee engagement according to the experts of the workplace culture is important .
but the data is useless if the car@@ et@@ akers of a company do not take action .
&quot; indeed , when a company asks for your feedback , it may have a expectation that change is on the way . &quot;
&quot; and if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can discipline dis@@ appointments and de@@ motiv@@ ate employees . &quot;
&quot; if you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , &quot; said Rus@@ sell Ra@@ ath , President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kot@@ ter International , who saw companies who have reli@@ ed too much on collecting data . &quot;
&quot; because if you don &apos;t follow your staff , ask , &quot; &quot; Do you really belong to me ? &quot;
do you care about it ?
&quot; and if you don &apos;t care about it , why should I ? &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ dison Re@@ ed , who now conduc@@ ts monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day if a problem is reported via G@@ lin@@ t , so Er@@ ret@@ t . &quot;
&quot; and after collecting feedback from frustr@@ ated employees , it was able to re@@ organize several teams within the company and to add a communication training to address the problems . &quot;
&quot; at Ru@@ by Tuesday , the company always gets new insights into employees , hoping that in the long run , this leads to a better bond of employees in a sector that is known for high turnover . &quot;
&quot; if you are not oblig@@ ated to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , &quot; said Vit@@ rano . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose people , you also lose customers . &quot;
&quot; and if you lose customers , you will lose business . &quot;
the N@@ CA@@ A removes the two @-@ day practices and makes a long day for the fry
it starts at 11 : 00 when a lot of U@@ C@@ LA foot@@ ball@@ players enter@@ tain on one side of the new practice areas of the team on campus .
some have moved out their cot@@ ton@@ holes and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .
&quot; for a good part of the team , these idle minutes represent a lunch break . &quot;
players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their audi@@ ts after the three @-@ hour practice before returning to the Water@@ man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 .
&quot; this is a real treadmill for the guys the next three days , &quot; said Bru@@ ins @-@ Trainer Jim Mor@@ a just before the Monday was Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the N@@ CA@@ A eliminated two @-@ day exercises to facilitate the load of the players , and it actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the first three sessions of the U@@ C@@ LA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players . &quot;
the compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Brotherhood postpon@@ ed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mor@@ as conducted practical exercises in West@@ wood for the first time .
&quot; during August 20 , they will be holding 18 exercises . 20 before the beginning of formal play preparations for their pr@@ elu@@ de to Texas A &amp; M in September . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ a said that he supported the rule change of the N@@ CA@@ A , even if they add another point to the busy routes of the players . &quot;
&quot; we put this enormous strain on them three or four days and it &apos;s very challenging , &quot; &quot; said Mor@@ a . &quot;
&quot; and they just pushed it through , they pl@@ aten , they are great people . &quot;
&quot; I think , as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . &quot;
&quot; the U@@ C@@ LA will end its practice as soon as the camp is over , which will not be an easy task given the clear line of sight of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Lus@@ kin Center , a hotel in the up@@ scale class that has already cleared a safety net behind a door@@ post . &quot;
&quot; Bru@@ ins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mor@@ a admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . &quot;
&quot; we will use our security , &quot; Mor@@ a said . &quot;
&quot; this is a real problem , and it is not far @-@ fet@@ ched to think that people are renting a room there and then set up there to record an exercise . &quot;
&quot; if you have the vide@@ ot@@ ape of an exercise , it &apos;s a pretty good deal . &quot;
but we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .
we will do the best with what we have .
I don &apos;t worry too much about that .
we have a plan . &quot;
Facebook wants to intensi@@ fy facts @-@ review in the fight against counter@@ f@@ eit news
&quot; Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news items from third parties and show their results under the original contribution , said the world &apos;s largest online social network on Thursday . it is one of his efforts to combat so @-@ called fake news . &quot;
&quot; the company said in a statement on its website that it will begin with the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false noti@@ fications and to send them to fac@@ tual inspec@@ tors , which may display results of the fact check out of the original article . &quot;
&quot; Facebook has been critic@@ ised as one of the main distribution points for so @-@ called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced US presidential elections in 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French voters flooded with false stories in the run @-@ up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to be punished for social media networks if they fail to get rid of hat@@ eful post@@ ings as before the elections there in September . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new facts @-@ review will be started . &quot;
&quot; in addition to finding out which stories are challenged by fak@@ ers of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , &quot; said Sara S@@ u , Product Manager for Facebook news in a blog . &quot;
&quot; she added that Facebook will continue to be testing its feature to the &quot; &quot; related article &quot; &quot; and works on other changes in his news feed to reduce false news . &quot;
creating a comic novel : a castle in the history of England
&quot; in his recent past , the little Scot@@ ney Castle was seen in a squee@@ ze music video and was a lo@@ op@@ hole for Margar@@ et T@@ hat@@ cher in the 1970 and 1980 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; but Scot@@ ney has experienced 700 years of turbul@@ ent history from his cozy seat at the Main@@ l River Valley in K@@ ent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rho@@ des , a m@@ op@@ ha@@ i@@ red Yor@@ k@@ shi@@ re@@ man with a preference for historical documents . &quot;

what a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand .
&quot; a Castle in England takes the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scot@@ ney . each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Ste@@ ie@@ wicz , Bri@@ ony May Smith , William Ex@@ ley , Beck@@ y Pal@@ mer and Isa@@ bel Gre@@ enberg . &quot;
&quot; it is not the first book of Rho@@ des , which is based on an archive : he wrote &apos; Dead Men &apos;s Te@@ eth and Other Stories &apos; in 2014 , a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found un@@ expect@@ edly emotional . &quot;
&quot; I have responded only to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700 &apos;s , who worked for the Jacob@@ ins , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is his thumb print ! &quot;
&quot; and letters always smell of smoke , for at that time a fire was kind@@ led because of the light . &quot;
&quot; for someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were also there . &quot;
&quot; Oh , I love archives ! &quot;
&quot; for someone who is so beaten with old papers , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle almost four months ( &quot; &quot; To be honest : I have over@@ rated my welcome greeting &quot; &quot; ) all this seems too nice to be true . &quot;
&quot; Rho@@ des spent his days exploring the Victori@@ an &quot; new &quot; castle , viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curi@@ osi@@ ties of the castle , such as the mounted hy@@ ena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the dit@@ ch . &quot;
&quot; he wander@@ ed through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle , and spoke to the painters , gar@@ den@@ ers , and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book . &quot;
&quot; then , at night he drank &quot; whis@@ key and began to write . &quot;
&quot; the intimate history of Scot@@ ney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hus@@ sey , died . &quot;
&quot; when Rho@@ des arrived a decade later , the employees just began to take care of the archive , which he described as &quot; hundreds of years in which aristo@@ crats said &quot; Oh , throw it on the attic . &quot; &quot;
&quot; di@@ aries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards representing what possessed : &quot; one could think that land conflicts would be boring , &quot; Rho@@ des says , &quot; but there was a bir@@ ch to fight the two families . &quot;
&quot; guys , let all go his course ! &quot;
&quot; some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base to dive into English history , among them &apos; The Lab@@ our@@ er &apos; , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 13@@ 81 . &quot;
&quot; there is a record of an uprising that occurred in the castle in 13@@ 80 , in this book entitled &apos; Kni@@ gh@@ tly Famili@@ es of K@@ ent and Sus@@ sex &apos; , Rho@@ des says . &quot;
&quot; the peasant uprising began in this area , and I thought an uprising was a good start . &quot;
perhaps the two are inter@@ connected ? &quot;
&quot; other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as &apos; The Pri@@ est &apos; , which tells the story of the Jesu@@ it patron , which the family Dar@@ rel@@ l hid for seven years during the English Reformation . &quot;
&quot; or &apos; The S@@ mu@@ gg@@ ler &apos; , in which the smu@@ gg@@ ler Arthur Dar@@ rel@@ l is represented from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coff@@ in with stones ( a discovery made only years later when his coff@@ in was excav@@ ated ) . &quot;
&quot; the Dar@@ r@@ ells are Rho@@ des &apos;s favourite family of Scot@@ ney : &quot; &quot; the gentlemen seemed to be quite bun@@ ches , and always pay debts and spend money for things they could not afford . &quot;
&quot; other generations of Dar@@ rel@@ l men solved their debt crises by mar@@ rying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well @-@ looking guys , with a talent to adverti@@ se within . &quot;
&quot; after the end of his involvement in the castle , Rho@@ des is in search of other unique writing experiences &quot;
&quot; he has taken a two @-@ week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about E@@ lä@@ kel@@ mä@@ ki , the grounds of a san@@ atorium from the early 20th century , which has since been rec@@ laimed by nature . &quot;
but Scot@@ ney has a special place for him .
&quot; I was sad to go again , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; it was like &quot; &quot; Ah , now I have to deal with the dam@@ ned life again . &quot;
campaign launched : over 300 years old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle veiled in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf
&quot; with the v@@ eiling of the 30@@ 1 year old Mari@@ enk@@ ap@@ elle in Rh@@ ön@@ dorf , Bad Honnef has launched its campaign for the introduction of a new umbrella brand ( Rund@@ schau from Thursday ) on Friday . &quot;
&quot; until Thursday , mayor Otto Neu@@ hoff and his marketing team seek to keep Nelson Ar@@ tz the logo and slogan . &quot;
&quot; at the end of August , the highlight of the campaign is to celebrate a festival on the island of Gra@@ fen@@ wer@@ th . &quot;
&quot; too nice for us .
&quot; or ? &quot; &quot; the makers of the action have been asking for the posters at the Rh@@ ön@@ dorfer Chapel since yesterday . &quot;
&quot; we think this ( of course ! ) not really , &quot; &quot; she wrote on her yesterday released website . &quot;
but we use this measure to attract your attention .
and to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .
&quot; in essence , we believe that we , as the Bad Honne@@ fer , know the beauty and attrac@@ tiveness of our city very well . &quot;
&quot; the action is about more than &quot; &quot; just &quot; &quot; a logo and a slogan , that is to say . &quot;
&quot; it is important to form@@ ulate a stand @-@ alone promise , one that gives the city an unmistak@@ able unique selling proposition . &quot;
&quot; finally , they stand in competition with other municipalities . &quot;
a mid @-@ figure five @-@ digit amount will cost the City of Bad Honnef its new umbrella brand and the campaign costs .
military reforms in Turkey - Erdo@@ gan &apos;s fear of the army
&quot; every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( Y@@ AS ) advises on reti@@ rements and promotions in the officer cor@@ ps . &quot;
so also this week .
at first glance a normal process .
but nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt .
&quot; the meeting was no longer held in the headquarters of the general staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister . &quot;
&quot; under the chair@@ manship of the Heads of Government , the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions . &quot;
&quot; thus , the civilians in the Y@@ AS were in the number of over@@ numbers . &quot;
the government tigh@@ tens the re@@ ins in the military .
&quot; head of Staff Hul@@ us@@ i Ak@@ ar remains in office , but the com@@ man@@ ders of the army , the Air Force and the Navy have been dismissed . &quot;
&quot; since the failed coup , head of state Erdo@@ gan 169 has fired 169 of the 3@@ 26 gener@@ als and admir@@ als . &quot;
&quot; more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Ex@@ ile Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , which Erdo@@ gan sees as the wi@@ re@@ head of the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; against 4@@ 86 persons , who have been directly involved in the coup attempt , will be negotiated in Ankara since this week . &quot;
&quot; already on the day after the coup , Erdo@@ gan was called &quot; &quot; God &apos;s gift &quot; , &quot; because he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces . &quot;
but does Erdo@@ gan really have a grip on the army ?
&quot; at the end of February , the newspaper &quot; Hür@@ ri@@ yet &quot; published an article titled &quot; Un@@ ha@@ iry in the Military Head@@ quarters . &quot; &quot;
&quot; there are concerns in the general staff because of an increasing &quot; Islam@@ isation &quot; of the army , which , among other things , mani@@ f@@ ests itself in the lifting of the veil for soldiers , wrote the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the big pur@@ ist in the army and the security forces continues . &quot;
&quot; in mid @-@ July , Erdo@@ gan ordered another 7@@ 3@@ 95 state servants by decree , including 230@@ 3 polic@@ emen and 5@@ 46 soldiers . &quot;
it seemed like Erdo@@ gan has t@@ amed the military .
the gener@@ als were formerly considered to be the real lords of the country .
three times they put@@ ted their role as guar@@ dians of the secular state order .
&quot; following his victory in 2002 , Erdo@@ gan pressed the power of the military step by step , not least by calling on the European Union &apos;s reform demands . &quot;
former officers say Erdo@@ gan is systematically pushing a Islam@@ ization of the armed forces .
&quot; in the magazine &quot; Vo@@ cal Europe , &quot; an un@@ named officer , who sought asylum after the coup attempt of persecution abroad , warned the Turkish army in a few years &quot; full of extre@@ mi@@ sts and sal@@ a@@ fi@@ sts . &quot; &quot;
&quot; if this is true , such development could not allow Nato to get cold . &quot;
&quot; in any case , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army in the Alliance after the pur@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; leadership structures and operational capabilities are &quot; weakened , &quot; say Nato diplom@@ ats . &quot;
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card
&quot; there will be a new U.S. immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Tru@@ mp , quoted by the media . &quot;
&quot; he plans to lower the legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , stric@@ ter rules on obtaining visa for a temporary work permit and restrictions on family @-@ oriented vis@@ as . &quot;
the new rules are proposed by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans and supported by the President .
the draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .
&quot; this law will reduce poverty , increase wages and save billions of dollars for tax@@ pa@@ yers and will do so by ex@@ changing the way citizens are spent from other countries Green Cards . &quot;
the law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .
&quot; this new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , &quot; &quot; said Tru@@ mp , quoted by the American media . &quot;
ministry wants to renov@@ ate route for racing car
&quot; again and again , over the past few months , the future of the race car has been cont@@ ested - now it should go quite fast . &quot;
&quot; before the end of the year , the track on which the tourist route runs , is to be built . &quot;
&quot; in order to secure the future of the race car in the long term , construction work will be scheduled for this year according to the Ministry of Transport . &quot;
&quot; with the decision to further order and renov@@ ate the route Il@@ men@@ au @-@ Renn@@ stei@@ g , the country is committed to this especially for tourism , &quot; declared Minister of Transport , Klaus S@@ üh@@ l , on Friday in Er@@ furt . &quot;
the cost for the repair of the track was estimated at about 2.5 million euros .
&quot; of this sum , the country will take over 75 percent . &quot;
&quot; the contract , on which the shuttle will also be ordered from the country in the future , will be finally agreed , stated S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the Ministry and the South Thurin@@ gian Rail as an operator are already in agreement with the technical details .
&quot; this means that the road@@ map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , &quot; said S@@ üh@@ l . &quot;
the planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .
&quot; as a result , the race track shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 . &quot;
the race track shuttle is a popular railway connection between the stations Il@@ men@@ au and Renn@@ stei@@ g .
&quot; in the past few months , during a pilot operation , it has been tested whether the track is used by enough people to re @-@ order it regularly in the future . &quot;
the track is also strongly b@@ ump@@ y in parts .
the rise of sex robots is real and we should be worried
&quot; just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming . &quot;
&quot; yes , indeed . &quot;
sex robots are currently a big thing .
the Foundation for Respon@@ sible Robot@@ ics ( FR@@ R ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .
&quot; according to No@@ el Sh@@ ark@@ ey , Professor of Robot@@ ics and Arti@@ ficial Intelligence at the University of She@@ ff@@ iel@@ d and co @-@ founder of the FR@@ R , we must start taking her ascension seriously . &quot;
&quot; customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the ni@@ pple and the type of f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ail . &quot;
&quot; people make fun of them , but companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Sh@@ ark@@ ey on the publication of his new report . &quot;
modern sex dolls have evolved from their infl@@ atable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence .
&quot; the user can also &quot; &quot; adapt &quot; &quot; his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the ni@@ p@@ ples to the type or color of his f@@ ing@@ ern@@ ails . &quot;
&quot; but it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the &quot; personalities &quot; that a step@@ ford woman would look progressive . &quot;
modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin .
&quot; the Real@@ B@@ oti@@ x robot , for example , enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sh@@ y@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; and then there is the Ro@@ xx@@ x@@ xx Gold sex robot developed by True Compan@@ ion with pre @-@ programmed personalities such as &quot; Fri@@ gi@@ d Far@@ rah , &quot; which gives the impression of sh@@ y@@ ness and &quot; Wild Wend@@ y &quot; with an &quot; adventurous &quot; personality . &quot;
&quot; Ro@@ xx@@ xy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible , &quot; enth@@ uses the True Compan@@ ion site . &quot;
&quot; so she likes what you like , and she doesn &apos;t like what you don &apos;t like , etc . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the day , she also has her m@@ oods - just like real people ! &quot;
&quot; she can be tired , fixed to conversation or she can be &quot; &quot; in mood &quot; &quot; ! &quot;
&quot; there are many disturbing aspects for this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the sub@@ mis@@ sive female features , the all@@ u@@ rement to rape , when one goes a step towards Fri@@ gi@@ d ( means here : reluct@@ ant ) Far@@ rah to concern , uns@@ ett@@ led one the most . &quot;
&quot; on his website True Compan@@ ion Ro@@ xx@@ xy with a vibr@@ ator , but for men . &quot;
&quot; if women ( sic ) can have a vibr@@ ator , why can men not have a Ro@@ xx@@ xy ? &quot; it says on the website . &quot;
&quot; however , these sex robots are not just a fe@@ tish or just just another sex toy . &quot;
&quot; their formation and increasing refin@@ ement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition . &quot;
&quot; most men of course will not hold any sex robots , and while the FR@@ R noted their rising popularity , they still remain on the ver@@ ge of consumer culture . &quot;
&quot; but what transp@@ ires from the marginal zones , can be very instruc@@ tive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live . &quot;
and many people are not strange or insul@@ ting until the free market gives permission to do so .
&quot; there is a certain over@@ lap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women &apos;s rights are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has bo@@ asted to have women sexually ass@@ aul@@ ted . &quot;
&quot; the most horrible aspect of the television series &apos; The Hand@@ maid &apos;s T@@ ale &apos; ( &apos; The report of the hand@@ maid &apos; ) are not the graphic images , the worn bodies and the out @-@ out eyes , but how realistic this vision works . &quot;
&quot; the Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap . &quot;
the goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical simil@@ arity to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with por@@ no@@ star proportions ) .
their builders want them to feel human that they im@@ itate the movement of a real body .
&quot; but , when it comes to their &quot; personalities , &quot; the robots are not real women . &quot;
they cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .
&quot; they have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could distur@@ b the imagination of total submission . &quot;
&quot; in other words , they are false slaves . &quot;
or to express it in the phrase of 2017 : ma@@ ids
tru@@ mp Great performance ?
he makes Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney the ep@@ it@@ ome of healthy human understanding
&quot; it has become a tru@@ ism of the Tru@@ mp era that political divisions , which have pol@@ arized the US voters , have also split families in small format . &quot;
&quot; around Christmas and Th@@ ank@@ sgiving , there were newspapers with advice about how to deal with the horror of Tru@@ mp . &quot;
we all rep@@ ented to let our filter bubbles burst .
less noticed is the power tru@@ mp to bring families together .
&quot; I mention this because my cous@@ in , a lef@@ tist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the re@@ public@@ ans in our family , visited me this week in New York . &quot;
she reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .
&quot; with Tru@@ mp in the White House everyone who knows it , including the republi@@ can kin@@ ship with which she strug@@ gled for decades because of politics , suddenly and quite strange on the same side . &quot;
&quot; this is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it seems to me in a further context that this also ent@@ ails considerable risks . &quot;
&quot; the left was strengthened by Tru@@ mp , but the dis@@ figur@@ ing effect of his presi@@ dency has the power to push us all to the right . &quot;
&quot; when we speak of &quot; &quot; norm@@ alization &quot; &quot; and Tru@@ mp , we refer to the cre@@ ep@@ y possibility that one day his k@@ itt@@ ens will no longer be rep@@ ul@@ sed . &quot;
&quot; there is , however , an even frigh@@ tening long @-@ term scenario in which Tru@@ mp re@@ public@@ ans of the right wing &quot; norm@@ alizes &quot; which suddenly appear as the ep@@ it@@ ome of reason@@ abl@@ eness in comparison to its standards . &quot;
&quot; today I find myself falling apart from an active nostal@@ gia for Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney &apos;s hil@@ arious version of the ma@@ d@@ man - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax return looked ) - both compared to Tru@@ mp would indeed occur to a very mild off@@ ence . &quot;
&quot; when Tru@@ mp goes , the next candidate of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans must be spiritually healthy to qualify as im@@ measurable improvement . &quot;
&quot; when my cous@@ in was in the city , we brought our children to the car@@ ous@@ el in Central Park , the largest of the car@@ ous@@ el of the New York Park@@ department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city when you don &apos;t need any caffeine . &quot;
&quot; the horses are huge , the fi@@ ber@@ glass designs on the central cylinder - all c@@ low@@ ns are cr@@ un@@ chy and the animals are twi@@ sting to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and the lim@@ per@@ ing music con@@ veys this in a strange way . &quot;
&quot; so many c@@ lich@@ és of a city dis@@ appoint : the views of high buildings become old , the sky@@ lines are too familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city will not do justice to the dream . &quot;
&quot; thirty @-@ five years later , and I am still not quite across the day when I found that Swiss Cot@@ tage is indeed not a Swiss Cot@@ tage - the subject @-@ pub Ye Ol@@ de Swiss Cot@@ tage counts not - but a big roundabout in northern London . &quot;
&quot; but the Central Park @-@ car@@ ous@@ el is still a strange magical experience , as here two two @-@ year @-@ old , one 11 @-@ year @-@ old and two women in the 40 @-@ year @-@ old can go on it and have all a great time . &quot;
&quot; if I could have evaluated the car@@ ous@@ el , I would have given him the full score , but fortunately no one asked for it . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , this week , in a department store , I was forced to evaluate my &quot; experience &quot; with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card . &quot;
&quot; in the coffee house at the corner of my street it &apos;s the same , plus the option to balance the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the counter . &quot;
&quot; this does not only lead to a slow@@ down of what is supposed to be a neutral exchange , but also ex@@ erts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is required . &quot;
&quot; the poor woman in the department store was ap@@ ologi@@ zing , while I was tired of making my credit card with five stars . &quot;
Oscar Pist@@ ori@@ us moved from prison to hospital with chest pain
&quot; for the second time , Pist@@ ori@@ us has left the prison for a hospital visit . &quot;
&quot; last year , he was hospit@@ alized because of the treatment of cuts on his w@@ ri@@ sts , according to the prison authorities , according to a case in his cell . &quot;
&quot; for murder , Pist@@ ori@@ us was convic@@ ted of murder after an appeal by the prosec@@ ut@@ ors . &quot;
he killed Ste@@ enk@@ amp in the early morning hours of Valent@@ ine &apos;s Day 2013 by firing it several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pre@@ tori@@ a .
&quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us claimed that he held his girlfriend for a night@@ time intru@@ der , hiding in the cabin . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ ut@@ ors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six @-@ year prison sentence of Pist@@ ori@@ us App@@ ell , of which they say it is too len@@ i@@ ent . &quot;
&quot; the National Criminal Inves@@ tig@@ ative Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; Pist@@ ori@@ us runs a risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosec@@ ut@@ ors are successful . &quot;
there is no death penalty in South Africa .
as farmer Arnold finds a strange egg
&quot; as the last of the schools in Blum@@ berg , the four @-@ thous@@ anders from caps and ho@@ cks were released into the holidays and the secondary schools . &quot;
&quot; three of the students go to secondary school in the future , four to the secondary school . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening , An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürger@@ haus Bi@@ es@@ ental in E@@ pf@@ en@@ ho@@ fen . &quot;
&quot; the 29 pupils of the four classes , led by Sophi@@ a Schumacher and Reg@@ ine Me@@ der , elected a young Eagle , who is growing up in the poultry farm , but then released into freedom . &quot;
&quot; to do this , the m@@ lower band performed a musical with the title &quot; &quot; The Eagle in the hen @-@ erhof &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; farmer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to incub@@ ate with its chi@@ ckens . &quot;
&quot; instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out . &quot;
&quot; but the hope to make a chicken out of it , sm@@ ashed , the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and de@@ vil@@ ed . &quot;
after that the classes showed three and four in the studio of Y@@ von@@ ne Frank a chicken dance .
&quot; the h@@ ens danced with the young go@@ ck@@ ling , the cylinders carried to the bet . &quot;
&quot; the eagle stands for integration , said school leader An@@ geli@@ ka S@@ itte . &quot;
&quot; the young animal is different from the other k@@ itt@@ ens ( chi@@ cks ) , but belongs to it . &quot;
but he will never be like a chicken .
its purpose is to be free .
she wanted every four @-@ year @-@ old to feel accepted in his new school .
&quot; this was followed by thanks to the colleagues , former school manager Michael Müller , who repeatedly jumps to teaching g@@ asses , and the parents &quot; representatives . &quot;
&quot; the ch@@ ick @-@ time is over now , declared class teacher Sophi@@ a Schumacher . &quot;
&quot; she only divor@@ ces her students after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time . &quot;
&quot; finally , they can rely on the four @-@ se@@ ater . &quot;
&quot; finally , all students left a song of summer time and holiday season . &quot;
&quot; in the process , great joy broke out among the children . &quot;
eight first @-@ year @-@ old students have already registered for the new school year .
two Bulg@@ arians arrested for illegal camping in Greece
&quot; two Bulg@@ arians were imprisoned for illegal camps in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television . &quot;
&quot; in the morning of August 1 , the police arrested a group of illegal refugees in Si@@ th@@ onia , among them the two Bulg@@ arians . &quot;
&quot; on the same day , they were released while a study is underway . &quot;
the Department of Foreign Affairs reported B@@ TV that Bulg@@ arians were later released .
the Greek authorities have tigh@@ tened control of the free Camp@@ s and place anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .
the controls continue throughout the season .
the ministry said that the court can impose a fine .
software update for diesel vehicles : what the suffer@@ ers need to know now
how exactly does the software update take place ?
must diesel drivers participate in the promotion ?
the most important questions and answers at a glance .
&quot; at the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW @-@ Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . &quot;
they are expected to improve the emission of emissions of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 emissions .
Euro @-@ 4 @-@ dies@@ els or worse are exemp@@ t from this .
Anja S@@ met@@ anin from the ACE Car Club Europa gives reviews :
is the new action obligatory ?
&quot; no , the software updates are voluntary . &quot;
&quot; the obligatory updates only apply to the vehicles that have set up the Schum@@ an software , &quot; says Anja S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the upgrade was ordered by the Federal Aviation Office ( KBA ) .
how and when will customers be informed about updates ?
&quot; the manufacturers announced fast implementation over the next few months , but not yet known as an exact date . &quot;
Daimler advised to write to each affected person .
&quot; if an inspection is due anyway , this will be done within the scope of the inspection . &quot;
how long should the conver@@ sions go ?
&quot; hard to say , &quot; says S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
the hanging of the manufacturer &apos;s commitment as well as from political pressure .
&quot; because we have seen , the car manufacturers do not voluntarily act on the environment so far . &quot;
how long should the update take ?
the conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .
time @-@ consuming can be to get an appointment .
&quot; what do drivers do , which do not drive cars from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ? &quot;
the ACE tells you to wait .
&quot; probably foreign manufacturers would reti@@ re , so S@@ met@@ anin . &quot;
is a massive price decline of Euro @-@ 4 cars now threatened ?
the ACE is afraid of that .
but even in the regions where b@@ ans thre@@ aten .
&quot; in rural areas , there is so far no loss of value for older diesel engines . &quot;
the ACE tells you to wait for sale .
ll Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award
the Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most gl@@ amor@@ ous events in Washington .
the first award ceremony under President Tru@@ mp promises to become political .
one of the winners doesn &apos;t want to come - out of protest .
ll Cool J ( 49 ) receives first ra@@ pper one of the cov@@ eted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .
&quot; as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an ( 59 ) , Li@@ onel Rich@@ ie ( 68 ) and the chore@@ ographer Carmen de Lav@@ al@@ lade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le@@ ar ( 95 ) belong to the hon@@ ors . &quot;
awards are handed over at the beginning of December .
&quot; traditionally , U.S. President Donald Tru@@ mp will hold a reception and join together with his wife Mel@@ ania at the award ceremony . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the winner Le@@ ar announced with progressive TV series announced that he would refrain from taking part in the gala . &quot;
&quot; the New York Times said : &quot; &quot; this presi@@ dency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights - even the means to withdraw - and that bur@@ sts me . &quot;
the 59 @-@ year @-@ old Est@@ ef@@ an emphasized that she will use the conversation with Tru@@ mp to make her view clear .
&quot; the Kennedy Center , named after the former president , John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital . &quot;

we make the city life worth
&quot; Roland W@@ acker , Has@@ la@@ chs Stadt@@ bau@@ meister , will reti@@ re in retirement next year . &quot;
&quot; the place is already written out , but suitable candidates are ra@@ r . &quot;
&quot; for 31 years , W@@ acker has been the city master . &quot;
and the work still makes him great fun as he medi@@ ates in the press talk .
&quot; he reports on varied , but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , it is surprising that until now no application has fulfilled the requirements profile . &quot;
the city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time .
&quot; in this way , taking into account the regular periods of notice , there is still enough time for a revision . &quot;
&quot; since Has@@ lach acts as a sub@@ contractor for the administrative community , the applicant must present corresponding conclusions . &quot;
because this function wants to keep the city in any case .
&quot; if they could no longer fill them in , the citizens would have to travel to Off@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; but the clos@@ eness to the town is important to the city and to it , says W@@ acker , who talks about a good working climate and a good mood between the authorities and citizens . &quot;
&quot; in more than 30 years in office , some important projects have gathered to look back on the W@@ acker with pride . &quot;
&quot; we make the city worth living , &quot; he is confident about the Bau@@ haus and his employees . &quot;
but also in the future varied projects are on the agenda : the re@@ design of the former Hu@@ kl@@ a @-@ Are@@ as and the Nieder@@ ho@@ fen parking lot have come across .
the zig@@ z@@ ag bridge between Boll@@ enbach and Stein@@ ach is renewed and the stadium renovation is still a topic .
&quot; the latter will be hit by some 1.5 million euros , &quot; if we do it right , &quot; W@@ acker appreci@@ ates . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; all in all , great tasks await my successor . &quot;
the work here is fun . &quot;
&quot; for a city master , there is a lot of room for manoeu@@ vre . &quot;
&quot; with Has@@ lach &apos;s own building yard and gar@@ dener , it is possible to react flexibly to many . &quot;
&quot; you can move a lot , &quot; says W@@ acker , and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors . &quot;
&quot; as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to &quot; have an eye for what is going on &quot; when new buildings are approved , the out@@ going city building master emphasizes . &quot;
&quot; anyway , the mayor bears high responsibility . &quot;
&quot; he is a builder , &quot; &quot; in the end everything goes over my table . &quot;
&quot; with support and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neu@@ ma@@ ier ( Hoch@@ bau ) has been working for ten years , Manfred Schön@@ er ( civil engineering ) has been working for 15 years . &quot;
&quot; also , that his successor remains long , W@@ acker wants : &quot; &quot; we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and left with the job . &quot;
&quot; continuity is not only important for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city . &quot;
&quot; if you would like to bury Roland W@@ acker , you should have completed a completed studies as a diploma engineer or Bachelor &apos;s degree with the subject area architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of building and construction planning . &quot;
&quot; the Stadt@@ bau@@ amt accommo@@ dates high and civil engineering , construction guidelines , gr@@ under@@ ing opportunities , administration of municipal real estate , Municipal working yard with building yard and municipal gardening , as well as sub @-@ construction legal authority including monument protection . &quot;
bicycle tos@@ sed to leads : run@@ way closed
&quot; according to the police , the previously unknown perpetr@@ ators had thrown the blue bike from the railway slide transfer in the area of Le@@ oben Street ( B@@ 116 ) to the leader@@ ships . &quot;
these were damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .
the investig@@ ators go out of two male perpetr@@ ators and have been searching for them since the night .
near the scene witnessed a ros@@ y sco@@ oter and a bicycle driver .
&quot; this goes far beyond a Laus@@ anno@@ ben@@ stein , &quot; said Ö@@ BB spokesperson Christoph Pos@@ ch at the AP@@ A . &quot;
the perpetr@@ ators themselves would have put themselves in danger and also je@@ op@@ ardi@@ zed the train traffic .
&quot; in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system , as well as the delays and costs for rail freight transport , there may also be sponsors of rail customers to the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; overall , a &quot; substantial &quot; sum would be assumed , the spokes@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , the railway traffic on the south railway track could be managed without obstruc@@ tions . &quot;
&quot; almost ten passenger trains were out on Friday morning , two of them entered the correspondence . &quot;
&quot; there were no freight trains , but they were bel@@ at@@ edly . &quot;
&quot; according to Ö@@ BB spokesperson , Christoph Pos@@ ch , around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced . &quot;
insul@@ ators and ma@@ sts have also been damaged .
&quot; red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help allevi@@ ate IB@@ D ( inflammatory bow@@ el disease ) &quot;
red meat and chocolate can sound like a night@@ mare for your digestive system .
&quot; but a new study says exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat @-@ based proteins and dairy products , could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bow@@ el diseases . &quot;
&quot; the incur@@ able state , which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300@@ ,000 in the United States , causes stomach cra@@ mps and flat@@ ul@@ ence , recur@@ rent or bloody diar@@ rhe@@ a , weight loss and extreme fatigue . &quot;
&quot; while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at Wash@@ ing@@ ton@@ er University found that the essential amino acid tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut . &quot;
&quot; the conduc@@ tive researcher , Dr. Marco Col@@ onna , explained that immune cells are pat@@ rolling in the gut to ensure that harmful micro@@ bes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body . &quot;
&quot; cells that are able to trigger inflammation , are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue . &quot;
&quot; if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
&quot; experiments have been observed that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice is found , which carry a specific bacter@@ ium in their bow@@ els . &quot;
and the bacter@@ ium needs tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .
Professor Col@@ onna said : &quot; we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lac@@ to@@ bac@@ ill@@ us reu@@ ter@@ i - which is a normal part of the gut micro@@ bi@@ ome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .
&quot; the more tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells . &quot;
&quot; he suggested that the combination of L. reu@@ ter@@ i and a diet rich in tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han promotes tolerant , less inflammatory bow@@ el mi@@ li@@ eus , if the same system is wir@@ ling also with people . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ doctoral researcher Dr. Lu@@ isa Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan searched for a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was however separated , did not . &quot;
&quot; they suspected that the difference with the intestinal micro@@ bial chromos@@ omes had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fung@@ i , which normally live in the gastro@@ intestinal tract . &quot;
&quot; the intest@@ ines of the mice were DNA sequ@@ enced and there were found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in mice . &quot;
mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lack@@ ed an intestinal micro@@ bi@@ ome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells and they were given the L. Cross and the immune cells .
&quot; in order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system , the researchers L. reu@@ ter@@ i continued to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on un@@ ripe immune cells , which were isolated from the mice . &quot;
the immune cells developed into the tolerance @-@ promoting cells .
&quot; when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid , it proved to be a by @-@ product of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han metabolism , known as an i@@ dol @-@ 3 lac@@ tic acid . &quot;
&quot; when the researchers doubled the amount of tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han in the mice &apos;s food , the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent , but when tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han was hal@@ ved , the number of cells dropped by half . &quot;
Dr. Cer@@ v@@ antes @-@ Bar@@ ra@@ gan explained that people have the same tolerance @-@ enhancing cells as mice and that most of us L. repent in our gastro@@ intestinal trac@@ ts .
&quot; it is not known whether tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han @-@ by @-@ products from L. reu@@ ter@@ i develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han have been found in people with inflammatory bow@@ el disease . &quot;
she said : &quot; the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intest@@ ine .
potentially high tr@@ yp@@ top@@ han values in the presence of L. reu@@ ter@@ i can lead to an expansion of this population . &quot;
Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that Manchester United has a &quot; genius &quot; with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic
&quot; at Manchester United with N@@ eman@@ ja M@@ atic signed a &quot; genius , &quot; Jose M@@ our@@ in@@ ho believes that after the mid@@ fiel@@ der on Wednesday evening had his debut against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria . &quot;
&quot; the 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre @-@ season game before the UEF@@ A Super Cup ki@@ cked against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the keeper role as people like Paul Po@@ g@@ ba and Andreas Per@@ eira mar@@ ched at will . &quot;
&quot; however , M@@ atic was excluded from the prepar@@ atory Asia tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , which M@@ our@@ in@@ ho promised to improve before the start of the Premier League season . &quot;
&quot; he takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , &quot; said M@@ our@@ in@@ ho . &quot;
we will help him sooner than later .
&quot; in addition to M@@ atic , Victor Lind@@ el@@ of and Rom@@ el@@ u Lu@@ k@@ ak@@ u also started in the Avi@@ va Stadium , when M@@ our@@ in@@ ho made his start @-@ XI for the start of the season . &quot;
&quot; the Independent revealed this week that M@@ our@@ in@@ ho still wanted three more new commitments , but he insi@@ sted that the club had already done a &quot; fantastic job &quot; to fulfil three of its four primary commitments . &quot;
&quot; to get three out of four , I thank the association , &quot; &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; I will be happ@@ ier if they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great trouble . &quot;
Boeing &quot; paints &quot; Dream@@ liner into the sky
the U.S. aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a Dream@@ liner in the sky .
&quot; the pilots flew off Seattle in Washington state , but the drawing started in Marqu@@ ette in U.S. state Mich@@ igan and moved in the form of a Dream@@ liner about the USA , which are several thousand kilometers . &quot;
the action lasted 18 hours and one minute .
on the radar screens was the form of a Dream@@ liner .
the whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .
Boeing had previously made such advertising .
thus the number &quot; 7@@ 87 &quot; and the Boeing logo were painted in the sky .
&quot; new grav@@ estone for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem &quot;
&quot; but as the wind rot@@ ates , as Sig@@ mar Gabriel was still SPD leader , Social @-@ Democratic Prime Ministers , ahead of the elections , always looked after Berlin with a certain concern . &quot;
&quot; only no fire @-@ fire from the party central , but no head@@ wind from the Con@@ federation , was the most important wish of the elec@@ tors . &quot;
&quot; since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally . &quot;
&quot; since then , the employees from the Willy @-@ Brandt @-@ Haus are watching the events in the SPD @-@ governed provincial capitals . &quot;
&quot; what Mr Schulz had received from there since the beginning of the year , would not have been described in the approach with head@@ winds . &quot;
there were drau@@ ghts .
and one after the other .
&quot; after the surprising end of the red @-@ green majority in Lower Saxony , the CD@@ U sees a general signal against the coalition of the SPD and the Gre@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; this once again shows : red @-@ green can just not be reliable , &quot; said CD@@ U @-@ Secretary Peter Tau@@ ber to the German editorial office ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
the surprising vice @-@ president of a Green Party de@@ pu@@ ties the government of Prime Minister Stephan Wei@@ l ( SPD ) in a serious crisis .
&quot; five months before the Parliament election , his red @-@ green coalition lost its one @-@ vote majority to the opposition from CD@@ U and F@@ DP . &quot;
the Green German Managing Director Michael Kell@@ ner urged the stub@@ born Lower Saxony Member of the Green party El@@ ke T@@ west to return their mandate .
the transition to CD@@ U means a clear fal@@ si@@ fication of the vot@@ er &apos;s will .
&quot; El@@ ke T@@ ables must immediately return her mandate , &quot; &quot; said the Federal Executive Officer and campaign manager of the Green editorial network ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; this must not be true , &quot; &quot; said the SPD electoral champion , when on Friday morning the new job message reached the party centre . &quot;
&quot; Stephan Wei@@ l , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands after the transfer of the green de@@ pu@@ ties El@@ ke T@@ west to the CD@@ U without its own government majority . &quot;
it is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD &apos;s state associations .
and no one knows what comes next .
the Mis@@ ere began with the un@@ expect@@ edly clear defeat at the Saar@@ land election in March .
&quot; a blue eye , more not , the comrades reas@@ sured at that time . &quot;
&quot; after the elections in Schleswig @-@ Holstein and North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , everything will be different . &quot;
this was done - and everything became much worse .
&quot; the defeat in Kiel brought the SPD in exchange , the Düsseldorf @-@ bankrupt@@ cy cut the party smoothly . &quot;
&quot; in the weeks after , comrades , the comrades pain@@ stak@@ ingly ra@@ ged up again . &quot;
&quot; then , when they had just stepped up new courage , the G @-@ 20 summit came from Hamburg . &quot;
and with him came the next blow .
&quot; mayor Ola@@ f Schol@@ z , the last strong SPD head@@ liner , lost his Nim@@ bus that weekend because he was sitting in the El@@ b@@ phil@@ harmon@@ ie , while his city burned . &quot;
and because in crisis communication he was wrong doing what you can do wrong .
&quot; since then , Schol@@ z has been fighting for his political survival . &quot;
so now also Stephan Wei@@ l .
&quot; because of the VW @-@ exhaust @-@ affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been in criticism for quite some time now . &quot;
average survey values were added .
&quot; nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , Wei@@ l tried to emphas@@ ise accents in recent weeks . &quot;
&quot; the ambition of the former mayor of Hannover to expand his power in Berlin , also did not remain hidden in the environment of Martin Schulz . &quot;
&quot; they allowed him to grant him , because they promised a stabili@@ zation of the party . &quot;
now the exact opposite could occur .
&quot; in doing so , Wei@@ l is not guilty of the party @-@ internal compul@@ sion of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens . &quot;
and Schulz is not at all .
&quot; at times , comrades , therefore , make an effort to keep their own ranks closed . &quot;
&quot; their anger is directed toward the Gre@@ ens , and above all to the apo@@ state parliam@@ ent@@ ari@@ anism . &quot;
&quot; it is int@@ ol@@ erable and democratic , as Mrs. T@@ west puts her own career in the interests of all the others , &quot; says Matthias Mi@@ er@@ sch , head of the party left in the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , the editorial network Germany ( R@@ ND ) . &quot;
&quot; Mrs. T@@ west is not elected as a direct candidate for her individual , but has been elected to parliament on the state @-@ list of the Lower Saxony Gre@@ ens , thus the Lower Saxony Member . &quot;
the logical consequence would be that she returns her mandate .
&quot; Thomas Op@@ per@@ mann , head of the SPD Par@@ liam@@ entary Group , compla@@ ins of an &quot; un@@ democratic manoeu@@ vre . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the voters &apos; wil@@ le four years ago was clear : the people have made Stephan Wei@@ l the prime minister , &quot; &quot; says Op@@ per@@ mann , who heads the Lower Saxony SPD as the leading candidate for the Bundestag election , the R@@ ND . &quot;
&quot; now the personal career of a future CD@@ U de@@ pu@@ ties distor@@ ts the election result , &quot; &quot; said Op@@ per@@ mann . &quot;
he called for clari@@ fication of the background .
I want to know if there has been more or there has been further commitments of the CD@@ U Lower Saxony .
funding for local politicians III
&quot; who wants to renov@@ ate his house in the years , can get support from the country soon . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Mayor Albert Sch@@ ind@@ ler and three representatives of St@@ eg Urban Development were informed on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the information event , Sch@@ ind@@ ler once again gave a review of what was happening so far . &quot;
&quot; since 1991 , there have been sensi@@ tivities in remedi@@ ation areas . &quot;
&quot; at that time , in the rehabilitation region I from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden @-@ Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount . &quot;
&quot; in the refurb@@ ishment area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsi@@ dy was still 60 percent . &quot;
&quot; for Sch@@ ind@@ ler , the existing renov@@ ations are a &quot; success project &quot; - it is finally important to also promote the interior development , and not only to open up new areas of construction . &quot;
&quot; on April 4 , the Government Pres@@ i@@ dium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a refurb@@ ishment area III . &quot;
&quot; the amount of funding amounted to 8@@ 33 3@@ 33 euros , of which 500 000 Euros came from the country , the rest of the commune &apos;s sensi@@ tivities . &quot;
how is a remedi@@ ation area created ?
&quot; one will , so Sch@@ ind@@ ler continue to study , where the &quot; &quot; really old &quot; &quot; houses are . &quot;
&quot; however , it also plays a role if there is an interest in the planned area . &quot;
&quot; if necessary , the area limits could then be moved again . &quot;
&quot; the pro@@ pon@@ ents represented Martin Keller , Gab@@ y Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann and Sarah Got@@ zel on Wednesday evening . &quot;
&quot; basement presented the contents of the federal state programme &quot; Social City , &quot; in which the renov@@ ations would then be carried out . &quot;
&quot; the core of the program is the rev@@ ital@@ isation of city cities , improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; the measures would be object @-@ related , i.e. per plot . &quot;
the restructuring area would eventually be established as a statute .
the approval period for the funding period has expi@@ red since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 20@@ 26 .
&quot; until September this year , however , the stock@@ taking will be carried out only once , within the framework of which the participants involved in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire for filling out . &quot;
&quot; in November or December , as soon as possible , the sentence shall be carried out so that it can begin with the refurb@@ ishment in the coming year . &quot;
Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann subsequently declared that each commune had to carry out the said pre @-@ trial investigations .
&quot; it is a matter of assessing and deciding upon the conditions of the city , and to decide when it will be restored and to what extent . &quot;
there will also be a refurb@@ ishment note in the land register for the respective plot .
&quot; Pi@@ etz@@ sch@@ mann will once again come to sens@@ ations and get a picture of the situation , she promised . &quot;
Got@@ h emphas@@ ised that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .
&quot; this is why there will be questionn@@ aires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks , and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays . &quot;
&quot; the yellow questionnaire is the &quot; &quot; building and property sheet &quot; , &quot; where , among other things , it is about the structural condition and the remedi@@ ation views . &quot;
&quot; in the grey questionnaire , the &quot; household and home arch , &quot; information about the size , division and residents of a living room can be made . &quot;
the blue &quot; operating bow &quot; is only to be filled when in the building business premises are operated .
&quot; however , to be aware , Got@@ tsch@@ ou pointed out that a filled questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding . &quot;
&quot; in addition , new construction measures are not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
&quot; Sch@@ ind@@ ler still stressed that the distribution of subsidies according to the &quot; &quot; gre@@ y@@ ho@@ und principle &quot; &quot; - who first comes , grin@@ ds first . &quot;
you cannot book a subsi@@ dy for later . &quot;
&quot; finally , photos of the project &quot; &quot; Stadt@@ kern II &quot; &quot; were shown to make the present a rest@@ au@@ ration &quot; &quot; tasty &quot; . &quot; &quot;
British inventor himself uses a micro@@ chip to move into house and car with a hand movement
&quot; a British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a micro@@ chip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement . &quot;
&quot; Steven Nor@@ th@@ am , 33 , had im@@ planted the tiny chip between thumb and index finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company Bio@@ Te@@ q . &quot;
&quot; he has partner@@ ed with Dr. Ge@@ off Wat@@ son , an advisory an@@ aes@@ th@@ esi@@ ologist at the Royal H@@ amp@@ shire County Hospital in Win@@ chester , H@@ ants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards . &quot;
the technology resembles a cat and dogs im@@ planted micro@@ chip and takes only 30 seconds .
&quot; the company of Mr. Nor@@ th@@ am wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an extra cost of £ 300 per lock . &quot;
&quot; the married father of one has now installed both at home and with his BMW Z@@ 4 technology , which begins when his hand is at the wheel . &quot;
the advertising costs of the White House cost the tax@@ pa@@ yers thousands
&quot; the White House &apos;s decision to fly a nav@@ y helicopter to the South La@@ wn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost tax@@ pa@@ yers according to the military information left to TI@@ ME magazine , up to 24@@ ,000 US dollars . &quot;
&quot; the green @-@ white Si@@ kor@@ sky V@@ H @-@ 3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs . &quot;
&quot; President Donald Tru@@ mp , Vice President Mike P@@ ence and senior officials of the White House , made a tour of products from all 50 countries . &quot;
&quot; the helicopter manufactured in Connec@@ ti@@ cut was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Ma@@ ine , a Wis@@ con@@ sin fire @-@ fighting car and a for@@ klift from Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a frag@@ mentary order or Fra@@ go , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South La@@ wn , according to the records of the Navy Hel@@ icop@@ ter Squ@@ ad@@ ron One ( H@@ MX @-@ 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter . &quot;
&quot; I just wanted you to be aware of it , because it &apos;s such an unusual event with high visibility , &quot; wrote the commander of the H@@ MX @-@ 1 on the eve of the event , the Deputy Nav@@ al Commander for Aviation . &quot;
&quot; the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South La@@ wn at 7 o &apos;clock in the morning for the event at 3 p.m. , and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 on that evening . &quot;
the note adds that if the flight from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second squ@@ ad would be required for the return flight .
&quot; the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter , while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft . &quot;
&quot; from the notes provided by the TI@@ ME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required . &quot;
the H@@ atch Act prohi@@ bits federal workers to use state property for political purposes .
records show that H@@ MX @-@ 1 asked if the event could violate the determination .
&quot; a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the H@@ atch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , &quot; the command@@ ant wrote . &quot;
&quot; sounds as if you were locked , &quot; replied the deputy commander . &quot;
the event &quot; Made in America &quot; was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the H@@ atch Act .
but official events also have political over@@ tones .
&quot; at the event , the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate and he propag@@ ated efforts to cur@@ b government regulations . &quot;
&quot; the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon . &quot;
pres@@ idents are obliged to use them for travel .
but demanding their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .
&quot; in February , Tru@@ mp conducted an investigation when the Pres@@ idential powered aircraft stood in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of news that compla@@ ined about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor . &quot;
&quot; the White House is inspired by the show &quot; &quot; Made In America &quot; , &quot; which shows products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , &quot; said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House , Lind@@ say Wal@@ ters . &quot;
H@@ MX @-@ 1 crew frequently carry out training flights in the Washington and South La@@ wn area to reduce the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimet@@ ers .
&quot; when Tru@@ mp was at the G@@ 20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , H@@ MX @-@ 1 introduced 58 practice land@@ ings at the White House . &quot;
&quot; the flight for the &quot; &quot; Made in America &quot; &quot; event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month , said an officer . &quot;
&quot; hel@@ i@@ cop@@ ter units also flew 11 hours on that day for &quot; &quot; non @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency support missions . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the White House said that tax@@ pa@@ yers over@@ took the burden for none of the other pro@@ ps presented at the event .
a spokes@@ man of Si@@ kor@@ sky said that the company had not been involved in putting helicop@@ ters on the South La@@ wn .
&quot; H@@ MX @-@ 1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event . &quot;
&quot; according to the US Secretary of Defense for fiscal 2017 , the Do@@ D reimbur@@ sement rate for the V@@ H @-@ 3D is 24,@@ 380 USD per flight hour . &quot;
records of unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Fac@@ ility in Quanti@@ co in Virginia .
the White House ar@@ gues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .
&quot; the cost of tax@@ pa@@ yers based on estimates for reimbur@@ sement rates is highly mis@@ leading , &quot; &quot; said Wal@@ ters . &quot;
&quot; these estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means . &quot;
&quot; according to a RA@@ ND study from 2015 , the re@@ funds for Do@@ D do not contain personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract completion . &quot;
&quot; at that time , the former spokes@@ man of the White House , Se@@ an Sp@@ ic@@ er , defended the use of the helicopter for the event . &quot;
&quot; the idea is to present things this week that are made in America , &quot; &quot; said Sp@@ ic@@ er . &quot;
&quot; and I know Si@@ kor@@ sky and the state of Connec@@ ti@@ cut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not even thousands of people depend on it . &quot;
and I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked ti@@ rel@@ essly .
&quot; of course , it is appropriate to highlight this . &quot;
&quot; it was not clear if Tru@@ mp inter@@ acted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South La@@ wn for the event , but he sat down in the driver &apos;s seat of a fire truck . &quot;
&quot; in the White House , Tru@@ mp spoke to representatives of Si@@ kor@@ sky and sh@@ ook with the media about his own fleet of company products . &quot;
&quot; I know Si@@ kor@@ sky very well , &quot; &quot; said the president , &quot; &quot; I have three of them . &quot;

the TC blue @-@ white Ne@@ uss appears tomorrow at 11 o &apos;clock in Kiel at the table third Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V .
&quot; despite the still flaw@@ less balance of five games , the top rider of the Second Tennis League has gained the sense of reality . &quot;
team principal Mari@@ us Z@@ ay has respect for the opponent at any rate .
&quot; this is a compact team , which always plays in quite similar formation . &quot;
&quot; especially in the post@@ erior positions I find the crew very good . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; for the class and stability of the Su@@ chs@@ dorfer S@@ V , imports from the high north provide above all . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; their Dan@@ es and Finn@@ s can even point to interventions in the Davis Cup . &quot;
&quot; and they are also strong in doubles , &quot; says Z@@ ay , looking at Har@@ ri Heli@@ ov@@ a@@ ara ( Finland ) , Andr@@ e Gö@@ ran@@ sson ( Sweden ) , S@@ ören and Es@@ ben O@@ lesen , Martin Pe@@ der@@ sen as well as Andreas Bj@@ er@@ reh@@ us ( all Denmark ) . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is becoming difficult for us . &quot;
&quot; you also need a good portion of luck . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Ne@@ us@@ ser team for the trip to the high north is practical .
his debut for blue @-@ white could give Maxim@@ e Jan@@ four .
&quot; with the Chall@@ enger event in the Italian Bi@@ ella active Fren@@ ch@@ man not to the Bundes@@ liga @-@ Spiel , the Z@@ den@@ ek Kol@@ ar ( Czech Republic ) playing in the Czech Liber@@ ec ( Czech Republic ) will join the tournament for the first time in this season . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , the un@@ defeated Chil@@ ean Hans Pod@@ lip@@ nik @-@ Castillo finished with the white @-@ rus@@ hing An@@ drei V@@ asi@@ lev@@ ski at the AT@@ P tournament in K@@ itz@@ büh@@ el on the ball . &quot;
&quot; he should be in Kiel as well as Bot@@ ic Van de Z@@ and@@ ow@@ p , N@@ iel@@ s Lo@@ ot@@ sm@@ a ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Ju@@ lien C@@ agn@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; after his two victories , last Sunday against the club at the Al@@ ster , Má@@ té Val@@ kus@@ z could also back into the team again . &quot;
&quot; it is enough for the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Hungary , who was still the number one of the Junior World Ranking in January 2016 , does not fill someone from the trainer to Mari@@ us Z@@ ay the cad@@ re . &quot;
how America can hurt O@@ MV
Donald Tru@@ mp was not really happy when he put his signature under the law on Wednesday night to tigh@@ ten the sanctions against Russia .
&quot; in his ha@@ ste to en@@ act the law , Congress passed a few &quot; constitutional provisions , &quot; he estimated . &quot;
&quot; the reaction from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels re@@ pu@@ di@@ ated against the U.S. violation . &quot;
&quot; after all , the draft fores@@ ees to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pi@@ pelines in the EU . &quot;
&quot; since then , investors from domestic O@@ MV who together with other European companies have co @-@ financed the construction of the Russian Eastern Partnership Nord Stream 2 . &quot;
the Dro@@ h@@ kul@@ isse is huge .
&quot; nevertheless , it is too early for an estimate of the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Donald Tru@@ mp would have to raise the sanctions by Executive Order . &quot;
twelve weapons are available to him .
&quot; the press &quot; &quot; looked at what the group could rep@@ el and which could really hurt him . &quot;
Nar@@ cos Season 3 Tra@@ iler : without Pablo Es@@ co@@ bar the Cal@@ i Cart@@ el is put into focus on Net@@ fli@@ x
&quot; despite the second season of Nar@@ cos , the Pablo Es@@ co@@ bars Kil@@ ler reveals , the Net@@ fli@@ x series is far from over . &quot;
&quot; the seasons three and four were already confirmed by streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest villa@@ ins of the show . &quot;
&quot; with the third season , the DE@@ A has paid attention to the richest organisation of drug trafficking in the world : the Cal@@ i @-@ Kart@@ ell . &quot;
&quot; led by four powerful sponsors , they operate &quot; like a Fort@@ une 500 company , &quot; only with more state bri@@ bes and violent actions . &quot;
&quot; Gil@@ berto Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Dam@@ ian Al@@ c@@ azar ) is the leader of the cart@@ el , Miguel Rodri@@ gu@@ ez Ore@@ ju@@ ela ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) is her head , P@@ ach@@ o Herr@@ era ( Alberto Am@@ mann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Ch@@ ep@@ e Sant@@ ac@@ ru@@ z London@@ o ( Pep@@ e Rap@@ ha@@ ote ) is located in New York . &quot;
&quot; in the newly released trailer , Pedro Pascal returns to J@@ avier Pe@@ ña , the guy who invites American and Colom@@ bian prosec@@ uting authorities to support the war on drugs . &quot;
&quot; other new actors are M@@ ati@@ as Var@@ ela , Michael Stahl @-@ David , Matt W@@ hel@@ an , Miguel Angel Silv@@ est@@ re , Kerry bis@@ he and Ar@@ tur@@ o Castro . &quot;
the third season of Nar@@ cos will begin on 1 September .
role backward : the city provides 46 kitchen aids
the city organizes the K@@ ita lunch table itself .
with fixed contact persons for the children and a assignment to the team .
&quot; in the city &apos;s nur@@ series , the clock is turned back . &quot;
&quot; on September 1 , the city of Kre@@ feld takes over the food supply in the city &apos;s kinder@@ garten facilities ( Kit@@ as ) back into self @-@ control . &quot;
&quot; for Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz , deputy head of the youth welfare department , this is a good news : &quot; we were all very pleased . &quot;
cooking is still out of the house : a cat@@ erer takes care of this task and supplies fresh cooked ch@@ illed .
&quot; the town operates 46 day @-@ care centers in the Kre@@ felder area , in 44 the children get a hot meal at lunch time . &quot;
&quot; last year , 2,@@ 800 children sat at the tables , and the need grew steadily . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , not only children , who are served 45 days of the week , eat lunch at K@@ ita , &quot; explains Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; the offer is also valid in the 35 @-@ hour supervision , if children stay until 2 pm . &quot;
&quot; 46 part @-@ time staff have kitchen service starting September 1 : they warm up the delivered food , supplement them for salad , raw vegetables and fruits , por@@ tioning the meal individually , give the meal out , clean and clean the kitchen . &quot;
&quot; the employees are assigned to a K@@ ita , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
the size - there are two groups as well as seven units - decides about the circum@@ ference .
&quot; the kitchen workers are now part of the K@@ ita team , &quot; says Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; in this way , they are much more integrated and it is easier for the K@@ ital@@ ei@@ tung to implement pedago@@ gical concepts . &quot;
that &apos;s why it &apos;s about healthy eating and cooking lessons .
the children should help prepare the food .
the direct connection of the kitchen power to the team is sensible .
also for the children .
&quot; they have a known power in the K@@ ita , a person who is familiar to them , and not constantly changing people . &quot;
this continuity is important for the children .
cleaning of the K@@ ita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in future .
&quot; this variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen power , also has the charm that it has shown in the cost comparison between self @-@ control and foreign allocation for the city as the most economical , it is from the press office . &quot;
&quot; and that , although 46 part @-@ time forces are re@@ configured . &quot;
&quot; but these hours do not fall so strongly at around 750 persons in education , &quot; says Son@@ ja Pom@@ mer@@ anz . &quot;
&quot; Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN &quot;
&quot; elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the chief of the UN Mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; Nicholas Hay@@ som , reign@@ ing leader of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women are going to channel in the provinces . three women are candidates for the role of vice @-@ president and more than 30 percent of newly registered voters are women . &quot;
&quot; the role of women cannot be over@@ estimated , &quot; &quot; he said on Wednesday in a statement . &quot;
elections can only be truly representative and credi@@ ble when women fully participate and be included in all parts of the election process .
Afghan elections for the provincial council and presidential elections take place on 5 April .
the Taliban released threats against a choice trial that coinci@@ ded with the transition from international combat operations to an advisory role .
&quot; this year , elections for the first time will hand over the power to the next democratic elected government . &quot;
Hay@@ som said a strong role for women will increase the democratic success of Afghanistan .
the Afghan Independent Elec@@ toral Commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by registered 3.6 million voters .

men trying to eradic@@ ate 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl
two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to ro@@ b a 13 @-@ year @-@ old girl .
&quot; according to the police information , the men were saying the 13 @-@ year @-@ old , who was staying with friends at the Kol@@ p@@ ing@@ straße , about 2.@@ 55 p.m. , because they wanted to phone the girl &apos;s mobile phone . &quot;
but the 13 @-@ year @-@ old refused the request and continued with her friends .
&quot; then one of the perpetr@@ ators tried to attack the cell phone and the N@@ ec@@ kl@@ ace of the girl , which , however , failed . &quot;
without prey the du@@ et fled .
the two young men were later arrested by the police .
the investigations run .
G@@ MB concern about investment in the Mc@@ Vi@@ tie factory in Glasgow
a union would like to confirm its long @-@ term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow in the case of managers of the bis@@ cuit manufacturer Mc@@ Vi@@ tie .
G@@ MB Scotland said the company had out@@ weighed the future of investment at the T@@ oll@@ cross site .
&quot; more than 500 employees work in the plant , which , in addition to other products , manufactures plan@@ no@@ bs and rich tea bis@@ cuits . &quot;
Mc@@ Vi@@ ties owner Pla@@ dis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .
he added that employees and trade union representatives would &quot; be first experienced &quot; if their activities would change .
&quot; in a letter to the company &apos;s branch manager , G@@ MB Scotland Mc@@ Vi@@ tie asked &quot; &quot; to express concern that financing for the modernis@@ ation of production lines will not be pushed forward . &quot;
&quot; G@@ MB Senior organis@@ er Dre@@ w Du@@ ffy said : &quot; &quot; the fact that we cannot gain clarity about the business needs and investment plans for the future of T@@ oll@@ cross from the general site manager is deeply concerned about our members . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; generations of families have worked here and the workers concentrate heavily on the local community and the Greater Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage . &quot;
&quot; therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Bre@@ x@@ it , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flour@@ ishing production presence at Mc@@ Vi@@ tie . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ woman of Pla@@ dis said : &quot; &quot; the branch manager at T@@ oll@@ cross received a letter from G@@ MB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it , as we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives . &quot;
&quot; two months ago , we had regular meetings with members of staff and G@@ MB representatives in T@@ oll@@ cross , where some questions were openly discussed . &quot;
&quot; we discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we constantly monitor our business - and this applies to all our business units and locations - in order to remain competitive . &quot;
&quot; she added : &quot; &quot; over the past few years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our T@@ oll@@ cross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements . &quot;
&quot; we recognise the legacy of T@@ oll@@ cross as a production facility full and completely . if our operations at the site change , employees and their union representatives will be the first to experience this . &quot;
did the PS@@ G Barcelona warn of N@@ ey@@ mar three years ago ?
the page of La League may interest her interest in Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti
&quot; in their pursuit of N@@ ey@@ mar , Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main does not rel@@ inqu@@ ish after it has released an offer of £ 18@@ 9 million in order to release its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the record of the world record ? &quot;
&quot; the sensational approach has heated the transfer window in summer because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , whereby Paul Po@@ g@@ ba returned to Manchester United in the last season for 89 million pounds . &quot;
&quot; after finishing , N@@ ey@@ mar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the highest @-@ paid professional sports@@ man in the world . PS@@ G offers wages of over 500,000 GBP per week . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona is angry about the way that N@@ ey@@ mar has forced his way out , although a source close to the Catal@@ ans &apos; state insi@@ sts that the club has always tried his best to take care of him since his arrival from San@@ tos in 2013 . &quot;
but was the football world warned three years ago by the PS@@ G President before this prospect ?
&quot; when Manchester City expressed interest in signing Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i , N@@ asser Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PS@@ G . &quot;
&quot; I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , &quot; said Al @-@ K@@ hel@@ ai@@ fi . &quot;
&quot; we respect all clubs .
&quot; but if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . &quot;
&quot; Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , whereby the Spanish society expressed interest in the PS@@ G mid@@ fiel@@ der Marco Ver@@ r@@ atti at the beginning of this summer . &quot;
PS@@ G made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prize offerings for N@@ ey@@ mar .
sco@@ oter tos@@ sed and damaged
&quot; during the night of Friday on Saturday , a well @-@ known perpetr@@ ator has deliberately turned off a sco@@ oter in the royal court street in front of the property number 30 . &quot;
&quot; police Sch@@ ram@@ berg , phone 07@@ 4@@ 22 / 27 01 @-@ 0 , asks for instructions . &quot;
&quot; for an accident on the B 215 between Stol@@ zen@@ au and Le@@ ese , the police seek witnesses . &quot;
&quot; because a car crashed on his track , the driver had to do@@ dge a VW Tour@@ an and tou@@ ted the lead . &quot;
on Thursday evening the 34 @-@ year @-@ old from Reh@@ burg @-@ Lo@@ cc@@ um came to Le@@ ese in the direction of Le@@ ese with his VW at 19.@@ 55 clock on the B 215 from Stol@@ zen@@ au .
&quot; in the area of the b@@ ypass of Stol@@ zen@@ au , a passenger car met him in his lane , so that he had to switch to the right . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the Tour@@ an rider tou@@ red the console . &quot;
damage to the car was made in tangible damage .
&quot; the driver of the opposite car , a Mercedes Benz , over@@ took a truck and continued its journey without taking care of the traffic accident . &quot;
&quot; according to the accident damaged , it can be good that the mer@@ ced@@ ony driver had not noticed the accident . &quot;
the police now ask witnesses of the incident as well as the driver of the pol@@ lu@@ ter @-@ vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stol@@ zen@@ au at Tel . 0@@ 57@@ 61 / 9@@ 20@@ 60 .
interview : &quot; Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger &quot;
the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Report about the mis@@ use cases reli@@ eves Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger .
the author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann refers to this .
the final report on the abuse sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen provides further discussions .
&quot; Christian Wei@@ sn@@ der , spokes@@ man of the reform movement &quot; We are Church , &quot; explained after publishing to the German press agency , he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and current Cardinal Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , the 93 @-@ year @-@ old brother of the em@@ eri@@ ed Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , an ap@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; it would serve to serve the prestige of the Catholic Church , if Müller and R@@ atz@@ inger would express their deep regret about their own om@@ issions or their then false assessment of the processes . &quot;
&quot; the Vatican newspaper &quot; Os@@ serv@@ at@@ ore Rom@@ ano , &quot; on the other hand , critici@@ zed that in reporting on violence against the dome @-@ cats with &quot; &quot; two measures &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in respect of the ass@@ aults in Regensburg , no one doubt that it is a matter of &quot; sham@@ eful and sham@@ eful acts , &quot; which would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; however , the author Luc@@ etta Scar@@ par@@ ia , historian and member of the national Italian Bio@@ ethics committee . &quot;
&quot; the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares the public mind to keep it normal , &quot; writes Scar@@ par@@ ia . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis , too , said in an interview with Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk : &quot; &quot; one likes to go to the church and that is a found fres@@ co . &quot;
&quot; she also pointed out that in her youth , &quot; strikes have been a very normal educational means &quot; to be done with che@@ ek@@ y children as I was one . &quot;
&quot; it is unfair to apply today &apos;s standards for earlier decades , as the world has changed . &quot;
&quot; in connection with the reports on the mis@@ use cases , Pope brother Georg R@@ atz@@ inger often also appeared . &quot;
&quot; author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , author and historian Michael Hes@@ emann , wrote the book &quot; My brother of the Pope &quot; with R@@ atz@@ inger ( translated into 12 languages ) . &quot;
&quot; I must take the protection of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , &quot; says Hes@@ emann , &quot; for all this had nothing to do with him , &quot; he analyzes the results of the final report . &quot;
what exactly is in the 440 @-@ page report submitted by the dioc@@ ese Regensburg with the En@@ ligh@@ tenment lawyer Ulrich Weber ?
&quot; a total of 5@@ 47 Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , were &quot; &quot; with high plau@@ sibility &quot; &quot; victims of ass@@ aults , 67 dom@@ ed cats sexually ab@@ used . &quot;
&quot; in the final report , it is said to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : &quot; &quot; in summary , it can be said that by Dom@@ kap@@ ell@@ meister in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied . &quot;
&quot; especially with a high degree of emotion@@ ality , the punishment for the students could also be more violent . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to many other defend@@ ants , however , many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories are associated with him in many cases despite violence . &quot;
&quot; in the interview , Hes@@ emann explains why the final report on the mis@@ use sc@@ andal at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is reli@@ eved of his opinion . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Hes@@ emann , the 440 @-@ page report on the &quot; incidents of violence on protective grounds at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen &quot; is a contradictory picture of the cathedral @-@ master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , many students highlight his &quot; humanity . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he also appears as a chol@@ eric and perfec@@ tion@@ ist who became more tangible when a domain record musi@@ cally did not produce top performance . &quot;
how do you evaluate this final report as his bi@@ ographer ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is present at all . &quot;
&quot; there are eight pages dedicated to him , and he is clearly acqu@@ itted by any suspicion of complic@@ ity or mi@@ tigation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse . &quot;
the non @-@ violence at the pre @-@ school also took place outside of its sphere of influence .
&quot; at best , one can repro@@ ach him , too late , or to have first hints not taken seriously enough . &quot;
&quot; the gymn@@ asi@@ um , on which it worked , was felt by practically all the sur@@ vey@@ ed as - literally - &quot; redemption , &quot; &quot; heaven &quot; and &quot; better world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the vast majority of his disciples Georg R@@ atz@@ inger also testify , &quot; &quot; warm hearted , &quot; &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; &quot; sincere , &quot; &quot; competent &quot; and &quot; understanding , &quot; as an extremely good @-@ nat@@ ured teacher who supplied the boys with cakes , bis@@ cuits and sweets and &quot; always surrounded by the grapes of children . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only a minority is compla@@ ining about his perfec@@ tion@@ ism and his high emotion@@ ality , which also led to flood damage . &quot;
&quot; that he didn &apos;t just pop up with chairs and threw the key@@ chain on the ground , but also drew up earrings and too che@@ ek@@ y guys on the hair or ears , he has given himself years ago , deeply regre@@ t@@ ted and ap@@ ologi@@ zed for this . &quot;
&quot; to his salvation , however , it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the late 1960s , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents as well as with teachers . &quot;
do you also know such breeding methods ?
&quot; of course , I think every one of us was born before 1968 . &quot;
&quot; I also experienced this in a secular school , a high school . &quot;
&quot; compared to what it is actually about in this report , namely the horri@@ fic sexual abuse and the exc@@ esses of violence at the pre @-@ school , this is true of b@@ agu@@ ars . &quot;
&quot; one wonders if it is not to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedi@@ ct XVI , that many media r@@ ushed straight to him . &quot;
&quot; there are many who never understood him at the Bavarian Palace , still ze@@ al@@ ous . &quot;
but the truth is : the report is reli@@ eved by Georg R@@ atz@@ inger in every respect !
&quot; in connection with the report , the media reported a lot about the topic of abuse at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
will Georg R@@ atz@@ inger be accused of any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse in the final report ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : no . no .
not one of the 67 victims of sexual ass@@ aults claimed to have entrusted himself to the cathedral prison master .
not even the parents were inaugurated .
&quot; I never dar@@ ed to talk to my father or mother about it , &quot; &quot; said one concerned representative for the others , &quot; &quot; It was all very embarrass@@ ing to me . &quot;
&quot; the real problem with the clari@@ fication of sexual abuse was , however , that most victims of shame remain silent . &quot;
&quot; if they did not even entr@@ ust themselves to parents and si@@ bl@@ ings , then certainly not a ch@@ oral director , who would have been a colleague of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
how do the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen @-@ Stu@@ dents R@@ atz@@ inger &apos;s role in terms of the mis@@ use cases ?
Michael Hes@@ emann : a question@@ able student said : &quot; regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he would have had timely findings and could have stopped the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; I think it ... also for really absurd to assume that out of it ... Bu@@ ying un@@ ob@@ tru@@ sive or clearer or even more open than to their parents , dormit@@ ory managers , confidence teachers , etc . &quot;
that you talk to him about sex ... - un@@ think@@ able .
&quot; this is how the report comes to the very clear result : &quot; &quot; that the student and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance , could not be confirmed in the investigation . &quot;
&quot; as for sexual abuse , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is thus free to speak of everyone . &quot;
&quot; in this way , it cannot be accused of preventing it or having brought it to the display . &quot;
&quot; therefore , there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflic@@ ting crimes , as it was unfortunately done in some cases . &quot;
&quot; in the media , a lot of &quot; &quot; violent exc@@ esses &quot; &quot; were to be read at the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the former domain master Georg R@@ atz@@ inger is accused of &quot; &quot; looking away &quot; &quot; in the report . &quot;
does he have to live with this accus@@ ation ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : this is the big problem that everything is mixed up and mixed into a huge mel@@ ange of sexual abuse and violence , and somewhere in the middle of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger . &quot;
but that is exactly the abuse of the report .
&quot; namely , it is clean@@ ly separated : between the pre @-@ school and the gymn@@ asi@@ um of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , between sexual abuse and non @-@ violence as well as , let &apos;s say , other alle@@ gations . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , thus also from four decades in which Georg R@@ atz@@ inger was not the ch@@ oral director of the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
&quot; the whole terrible test pedago@@ gy , the cases in which boys of sa@@ di@@ stic teachers were sc@@ aled and painted , and who suffered terri@@ bly , were all at the pre @-@ school in Et@@ ter@@ z@@ hausen and P@@ iel@@ en@@ ho@@ fen , where really sc@@ andal@@ ous conditions have prevailed . &quot;
&quot; but with those of whom Dom@@ en@@ ell@@ meister Georg R@@ atz@@ inger had nothing to do , because he only got the boys face when they were already at the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um . &quot;
&quot; on this , as most of the witnesses stress , the theme &quot; &quot; pres@@ ch@@ ool &quot; &quot; was t@@ abo@@ o . &quot;
one was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even &quot; paradise &quot; states .
what was different at the gymn@@ asi@@ um gymn@@ asi@@ um ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : there was discipline , but no sa@@ di@@ stic violence . &quot;
&quot; this also applies to Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , where the report concludes that &quot; &quot; many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases despite violence , even combine positive memories with him . &quot;
at most it remains the repro@@ ach to have looked away .
&quot; but despite all efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre @-@ school . &quot;
&quot; the first time in 1970 / 71 , when he had just started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 . &quot;
did Georg R@@ atz@@ inger consistently afford ears in front of the states ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the dome gymn@@ asi@@ um , which the report even reproduced . &quot;
&quot; in this he points to it , &quot; &quot; that in the pre @-@ school the punishment is still practiced . &quot;
&quot; in the face of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent action . &quot;
&quot; that was , of course , at a time when legal clarity consisted of being banned in Bavaria since long ago . &quot;
&quot; before that , they happened in a legal grey area , as each of us still knows . &quot;
&quot; it was difficult for him to assess where the suffer@@ ers were perhaps exagger@@ ated or dramati@@ sed , and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded . &quot;
but you can &apos;t say that he always had looked away .
this is simply not true .
&quot; only in 1980 , the death penalty was officially abol@@ ished in schools in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; Princess Gl@@ oria von Th@@ urn und Ta@@ xis claimed that it was unfair to apply the current pedago@@ gical standards to the time that was at that time . &quot;
how do you see it ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : we historians talk about the &quot; pit@@ falls of an@@ ach@@ ron@@ ism , &quot; which is the danger of the past to evaluate past moral standards . &quot;
the princess is right .
&quot; but this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times was abom@@ in@@ able and also not for what was done in the pre @-@ school of ad@@ versity and violence at innocent children &apos;s boards , which goes far beyond that . &quot;
this is all very dre@@ ad@@ ful and I &apos;m glad that it will finally work .
&quot; but at the same time , I must take the protection of Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , because all this had nothing to do with him . &quot;
&quot; his means of discipl@@ ining and pun@@ ishing , i.e. ear@@ ners and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s . &quot;
&quot; as physical punishment was then banned , he has also kept strictly adher@@ ing to it . &quot;
&quot; what picture of his time in Regensburg , Georg R@@ atz@@ inger , has shown in the conversations with you for the book &quot; &quot; My brother of the pop@@ e &quot; &quot; ? &quot;
did the subject of test fine also become a language ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedi@@ ct XVI , from his perspective , since the Dom@@ sp@@ atzen played only a minor role . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , I do not by any means conc@@ eal that he led there a strict regi@@ ment . &quot;
&quot; but even this must be said : without this perfec@@ tion@@ ism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world tran@@ g from the hitherto rather nation@@ ally known Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , true cultural ambass@@ adors of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) . &quot;
&quot; with bis@@ cuits and candy alone , one does not make a great singer and a great singer before any success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and overcoming . &quot;
what kind of man did you experience Georg R@@ atz@@ inger during the talks about her book ?
&quot; Michael Hes@@ emann : through the work on the book and beyond , I have learned to know Georg R@@ atz@@ inger very well and again and again as a wonderful , humor@@ ous , base @-@ good , deeply believing and warm @-@ hearted man , from whom you can &apos;t imagine that he could do something even a fly . &quot;
&quot; I regularly get to see how many former dome @-@ cats are still today , 23 years after his Em@@ eri@@ zation , regularly contact him , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family . &quot;
&quot; those who do not forgive him until today , that he was once strictly speaking to them , are clearly in the minority . &quot;
most Dom@@ sp@@ atzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music .
&quot; and that he is always a good , father@@ ly teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but yet also a desirable resp@@ ectable person , to which they still look up today and which they almost rever@@ e . &quot;
&quot; and please , again quite clearly : everything you repro@@ ach upon are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time . &quot;
we can be happy that we have long since overcome this time .
&quot; but it is most un@@ just , a man just because he is promin@@ ently and has an even more prominent brother to become a medi@@ al sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at . &quot;
&quot; there is the evil intent behind it , only too obvious . &quot;
&quot; the report , which has just been published , reli@@ eves it . &quot;
&quot; now the settlement would stop , a 93 @-@ year @-@ old man who bought great mer@@ its and without whom no one would know the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen , without leaving Bavaria &apos;s and maybe even Germany , to finally leave the Regen@@ s@@ burger Dom@@ sp@@ atzen . &quot;
