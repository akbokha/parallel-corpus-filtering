<seg id="1">Munich 1856: four cards that change your view of the city</seg>
<seg id="2">An Irren-Anstalt where young people should meet today.</seg>
<seg id="3">A crypt which is now dug for the S-Bahn tunnel.</seg>
<seg id="4">Farmers are cultivating the former cause of farmers.</seg>
<seg id="5">The oldest official card of Munich promotes exciting stories about days.</seg>
<seg id="6">It gets nervous when maps are not up-to-date.</seg>
<seg id="7">Everybody knows this because the car-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass road.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlas, an offer of the Geoportals Bavaria of the state government, are anything but current - but therefore very enlightening."</seg>
<seg id="9">Especially if you compare it to current online maps.</seg>
<seg id="10">Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities in the spread-area of Munich's Mercury have changed since the 19th century.</seg>
<seg id="11">The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that you can't recognize as such.</seg>
<seg id="12">"for cities and municipalities, detailed maps, so-called" "original sheets" "were incorporated into the large overview map."</seg>
<seg id="13">"according to the Bavarian Palace Department, these were created between 1810 and 1864 and the first measurement of Bavaria's first survey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Your Principal: Napoleon.</seg>
<seg id="15">"the French army leader, Bavaria, occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria."</seg>
<seg id="16">Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic survey of Bavaria - of course for military purposes.</seg>
<seg id="17">"even if the French troops finally departed with the peace of Lunéville from February 9, 1801: it was today's neighbors who created the idea of a nationwide Bayern-map."</seg>
<seg id="18">"Elector Max IV Joseph further promoted the project, founded the" Topographic Bureau "- and thus the Bavarian Palace Department."</seg>
<seg id="19">The data sheet for Munich dates from the year 1856 and is like all others on the website of the Bavarian State Library.</seg>
<seg id="20">The comparison of early / today is most impressive in the example of the state capital.</seg>
<seg id="21">The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together.</seg>
<seg id="22">"one example is the fortiling, which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Sendling was incorporated 21 years after the map was created, i.e. in 1877, as a Munich suburb."</seg>
<seg id="24">Today it's located in the middle of the city.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the houses of Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the today's Plinganserstrasse, which was named after George Sebastian Plinganser in 1878, a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705."</seg>
<seg id="26">"where today is the Westpark, one sees nothing but fields - at first glance: when zooming in, a small-scale card with dozens of lines and numbers appears: handwriting numbered flurpieces from the so-called" "urine" "from which the basic tax was derived."</seg>
<seg id="27">"small parcels there are no more farmers there today, but farmers in the plant" Land in Sun. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">A large green area is located north of Untersendling.</seg>
<seg id="29">"Theresienwiese, the location of the Oktoberfest since 1810, was in fact still a meadow - and no concrete desert."</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the other side of the Isar, the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in the area of today's district Au-Haidhausen, one reads not only the street name" "at Gasteig" "or from the hill" "On the Ventilation" "- but also in large letters" "Irren Anstalt". ""</seg>
<seg id="32">"yes, here at the Auerfeldstraße you once closed people with delusions."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in 1858 / 59 there was the Munich district asylum" "Auf der auberge Lüften". ""</seg>
<seg id="34">"from 1872, Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought to the death of King Ludwig II."</seg>
<seg id="35">"he was progressive for his time and, for example, ended the accusation of so-called Irren."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in addition, he has forbidden the personnel to apply force against the occupants," "says Hermann Wilhelm, head of the Museum Haidhausen, who occupied himself for an exhibition with the institution."</seg>
<seg id="37">"for 280 patients it was first place, later extended to 500 places."</seg>
<seg id="38">"at some point, this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the chalk renal in Haar in 1905."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost (Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-Ost), one of Germany's largest psychiatrists since 2006."</seg>
<seg id="40">Young people in the Munich-based Salesianum meet now on the grounds of the former prison institution.</seg>
<seg id="41">The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities.</seg>
<seg id="42">"west is the football field of the TSV Munich East, east of residential buildings from the 1980s."</seg>
<seg id="43">"in 2015, the children's house" Casa Don Bosco "was built - in architectural reference to the original building of the Irrenzia, which was destroyed during the Second World War by bombing raids."</seg>
<seg id="44">"the Marienplatz was registered in 1856 as the" Main Place, "the Kaufingerstraße was called" Kaufinger Gasse. ""</seg>
<seg id="45">The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich.</seg>
<seg id="46">"in December 1944, the Allies bombed many holes in the inner city."</seg>
<seg id="47">A big remained until today - at Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="48">"the English Institute, small business houses and a crypt from the Middle Ages were once occupied by Marienhof, where these days will take place and on 5 April 2017 the ground-breaking ceremony for the second S-Bahn stem route takes place."</seg>
<seg id="49">With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with the aerial view of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof.</seg>
<seg id="50">Civil Rights Committee releases a travel warning for Missouri</seg>
<seg id="51">The National Federation for the Promotion of Farms has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri based on discriminatory policies and racist attacks.</seg>
<seg id="52">"the NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri, which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017, calls for special attention to afro-American travelers, visitors and Missouri, as a number of questionable, race-based occurrences occur throughout the state and will be noted here," "says the group's opinion."</seg>
<seg id="53">"a recently adopted law of Missouri, which makes it harder for people to gain discrimination, as well as the state prosecuting authorities that disproportionately target minorities, initiated the group to issue the travel warning, said the NAACP."</seg>
<seg id="54">They have violations of civil rights that happen to people.</seg>
<seg id="55">"they are stopped because of their skin colour, they are beaten or killed," said the president of the Missouri NAACP, Rod Chapel, the Kansas City Star. "</seg>
<seg id="56">We hear complaints in such a frequency that we haven't heard yet.</seg>
<seg id="57">It is the first such warning issued by the organization for a state in the United States.</seg>
<seg id="58">"the group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders, 28, a black man from Tennessee."</seg>
<seg id="59">Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more petrol during the voyage and was taken into custody by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime.</seg>
<seg id="60">"the Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Office of the Missouri General Public Prosecutor, which shows that black motorists in the state are 75 percent more frequent than white."</seg>
<seg id="61">"the recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families, friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri," Chapel. "</seg>
<seg id="62">"people need to be willing, whether to bring chewing money or to let relatives know that they travel through the state."</seg>
<seg id="63">"Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015, according to the latest figures from the hate crime programme of the FBI, which classifies the state in terms of the number of such violations to the 16th place of the country."</seg>
<seg id="64">"the warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law, which would make it harder to accuse a company for housing or employment discrimination."</seg>
<seg id="65">"previously, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona, after the states committed immigration laws to arrest local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for migration violations, leading to further racial profiling."</seg>
<seg id="66">"travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries, but recently, interest groups have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the United States."</seg>
<seg id="67">The electric fence project is elementary</seg>
<seg id="68">The Fischerbach Weidejn project is a success project and will continue in the coming year.</seg>
<seg id="69">The CDU federal deputy Peter Weiss and Kordula Kovac obtained a picture on the spot.</seg>
<seg id="70">Representatives of the Fischbacher CDU-town association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two deputies met at the court of the Schwendemann family.</seg>
<seg id="71">"Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his farm, where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest, 40 dairy cows and as many young animals cared for and accommodated in five apartments holiday guests."</seg>
<seg id="72">"for him, the" Black Forest "is the alternative route for the milk of its cows, such as Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="73">Only regionales arrive at the table of the holiday guests.</seg>
<seg id="74">"as he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach, he described the electric fence project as" "essential." ""</seg>
<seg id="75">I cannot profitably farm on such steep areas.</seg>
<seg id="76">"the grassland area care for a lot of work, much must be processed with the brushcutter."</seg>
<seg id="77">"we have to fight with the conditions and topography here," "said Schwendemann."</seg>
<seg id="78">"in 2003, he took over the parental farm and cultivated it without chemical plant protection and fertilizers, even if it did not lead a bio-business."</seg>
<seg id="79">"for mayor Thomas Schneider, it was clear:" the Commune has recognized the importance of the electric fence project and is happy about the leader-promotion. "</seg>
<seg id="80">"at the cost of 3000 to 4000 euros per hectare, farmers would have to be supported."</seg>
<seg id="81">It is hoped that the reforestation of the land could be drawn out for quite a while.</seg>
<seg id="82">"the biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and are thinking about how to carry on their business," "stressed the mayor."</seg>
<seg id="83">The farmers are often criticised for the promotion</seg>
<seg id="84">"in 2013, a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were fenced."</seg>
<seg id="85">"the area of disclosure is therefore 40 hectares, which may not be forested until at least 2023."</seg>
<seg id="86">"of the total cost of 71 500 euros, half of the leaders were promoted, one quarter contributed to the municipality of Fischbach."</seg>
<seg id="87">"thus the farmers remained 12 610 euros, which they had to invest in 16,2 kilometres of soft-fence."</seg>
<seg id="88">"the great advantage is the longevity of the fences," declared Schwendemann. "</seg>
<seg id="89">"Kordula Kovac stressed:" "you do a really good job, without farmers and housewives, it doesn't work."</seg>
<seg id="90">"also for Peter Weiss, it was clear that" "the best food is produced here." ""</seg>
<seg id="91">The Landscape Conservation Line (LPR) Baden-Württemberg enables the state conveyance of pasture-fences.</seg>
<seg id="92">The goal is to open the Black Forest.</seg>
<seg id="93">The condition is the presence of a conveyer marked by the LPR.</seg>
<seg id="94">"in addition, the enclosed area may not be sluggish-efficient (inclination of more than 35 percent) and must therefore be threatened by reforestation."</seg>
<seg id="95">"for the Fishermen's soft-launch project 2018, the application of eight participants with 24 parcels is currently underway, which would like to build almost 16 kilometres of fence."</seg>
<seg id="96">"the area of disclosure corresponds to 35 hectares, the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros."</seg>
<seg id="97">Is nothing more sacred?</seg>
<seg id="98">Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty</seg>
<seg id="99">The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues.</seg>
<seg id="100">The Americans regard these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Platz in Baghdad in 2003.</seg>
<seg id="101">"Stephen Miller, one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime, certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN on the propositions of the president for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty."</seg>
<seg id="102">"to stay fair, Miller did not handle the statue itself."</seg>
<seg id="103">A horde of boat owners and Liberty Imites would have liked him if he had done so.</seg>
<seg id="104">"but he resorted to its significance, and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus in 1903, 17 years after completion of the monument, was added to his base."</seg>
<seg id="105">"as Miller Acosta," I don't want to enter a complete thing about history here, but the Statue of Liberty is... a symbol of American freedom that illuminates the world. "</seg>
<seg id="106">The poem you refer to is later added and not part of the original Statue of Liberty.</seg>
<seg id="107">"Miller is factually correct, but as he formulated it himself, it is not really about history."</seg>
<seg id="108">"it is about the contemporary response to the startling words of Lazarus, the only ones in which a state does not only invite any old immigrants, but the poorest of the poor:" your weary, your poor, and your oppressed masses who long for free breathing, / the elating garbage of your rich coasts. "</seg>
<seg id="109">There was never a time when the "miserable garbage" was better to be seen on our screens.</seg>
<seg id="110">Miller was not involved in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump USA.</seg>
<seg id="111">This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural confrontation: it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America.</seg>
<seg id="112">"Lazarus - and her friends, who decided to place their words on the basis of their death at the base - knew very well that they performed a highly political action."</seg>
<seg id="113">The sculpture should show the connections between French and American republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a worn-out classical illustration.</seg>
<seg id="114">Lazarus changed this meaning: in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice.</seg>
<seg id="115">And she gives herself a very different name: mother of the exiles.</seg>
<seg id="116">The link between poem and image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American Nativism.</seg>
<seg id="117">"and just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue, the people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="118">"Grand Schreier Rush Limbaugh, a kind of John the Baptist for the coming of Trump, argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty calls no one, but rather an early neoconservative, who brings the American flame to the surrounding world:" Lady Liberty continues. "</seg>
<seg id="119">It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world.</seg>
<seg id="120">The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States. "</seg>
<seg id="121">"quite unusual, Limbaugh has come across something here."</seg>
<seg id="122">The importance of the statue is quite and even a question of the standpoint of perception.</seg>
<seg id="123">"the great imaginative action of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted, miserable, but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships."</seg>
<seg id="124">"in the true sense, it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives."</seg>
<seg id="125">Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear.</seg>
<seg id="126">"and, of course, this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump would ever want to recognize."</seg>
<seg id="127">"their torch should not illumine the path, but ignite the hatred that is their only source of power."</seg>
<seg id="128">World Championships 2017: Neil Black praises Scottish Members of the Great Britain</seg>
<seg id="129">Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team.</seg>
<seg id="130">"the executive director of the athletics of the United Kingdom, Neil Black, says that the 16-member Scottish contingent in the World Championship will make a massive contribution to the team."</seg>
<seg id="131">A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 which will start on Friday.</seg>
<seg id="132">"black believes that" "something special developed in Scotland" "and the athletics of the United Kingdom must learn something from it."</seg>
<seg id="133">"we welcome it, and we try to understand it and we will continue it until we find it," Black said. "</seg>
<seg id="134">I talk to people in the Scottish Institute of Sports and they think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="135">The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="136">British Athletics: it has something to do with what they have done.</seg>
<seg id="137">And also with the type on the street corner.</seg>
<seg id="138">"whatever the combination of circumstances is, it is absolutely brilliant."</seg>
<seg id="139">"several of the Scottish athletes are medals candidates, including Laura Muir and Andrew Butflip - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track, while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to captain."</seg>
<seg id="140">"" "Eilidh is rather modest."</seg>
<seg id="141">"her captain's speech was incredible," "says Black."</seg>
<seg id="142">"a number of athletes, whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train, went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivating."</seg>
<seg id="143">"the passion and the real feeling, which Eilidh did quite naturally, were great."</seg>
<seg id="144">"the Commonwealth silver medal winner, who will compete in their fifth world championships at the 400 m hurdles, says that it is" incredible "that 16 Schotten are in the British team."</seg>
<seg id="145">"Scotland's best total number of athletes at the World Championship was seven, which were reached in 1983 and 2015."</seg>
<seg id="146">The middle-distance runner Muir leads on this road and has set up five British and two European records last year.</seg>
<seg id="147">"it will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs."</seg>
<seg id="148">"Chris O'Hare, who runs 1,500 m, is another Scotsman to watch the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary games."</seg>
<seg id="149">Doyle remembered her first world championships as the only other Scotsman in the team Lee McConnell.</seg>
<seg id="150">"the team captain says she is" "enormously proud" "of the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team, but in some cases they will also be involved with the medals and the finals."</seg>
<seg id="151">"the special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team, so that it was a great honour anyway, but knowing that my teammers voted for me and chose me makes it something very special for me," she added. "</seg>
<seg id="152">Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team.</seg>
<seg id="153">It only shows how far we have come.</seg>
<seg id="154">"and they are here as established athletes, athletes, who want to climb on platforms."</seg>
<seg id="155">As for my speech as a captain?</seg>
<seg id="156">"yes, I think she went well."</seg>
<seg id="157">I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home world championship.</seg>
<seg id="158">So it is really important to rely on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back at the Olympiastadion Berlin.</seg>
<seg id="159">I get a second chance to go out and compete and it will just be such a great atmosphere out there.</seg>
<seg id="160">Blocking of critics about Facebook: don't worry about a public office if you cannot tolerate the embarrassment of voters</seg>
<seg id="161">The father of our country knew something of a bad press.</seg>
<seg id="162">"the Americans loved George Washington, but it didn't take long for the newspapers to beat him because of everything from domestic politics to its political principles."</seg>
<seg id="163">"he popped in criticism, sure."</seg>
<seg id="164">But he did not silence his critics.</seg>
<seg id="165">"in 1783, Washington said:" "freedom of speech can be taken away - and, stupid and dumb, we are led like sheep to slaughter."</seg>
<seg id="166">This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan who has to work on being more like Washington.</seg>
<seg id="167">Hogan's employees have blocked and erased the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page.</seg>
<seg id="168">And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week.</seg>
<seg id="169">"the governor's staff dismissed the suit as frivolous, and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with" Na, and?. ""</seg>
<seg id="170">"it's just Facebook," many people said. "</seg>
<seg id="171">But it is important.</seg>
<seg id="172">And it is particularly important if it is a type such as Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="173">This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is amazingly popular.</seg>
<seg id="174">He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation.</seg>
<seg id="175">Hogan is not a reactionary heat-head.</seg>
<seg id="176">He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles.</seg>
<seg id="177">He was also very cleverly in using Facebook as the primary means to connect with his voters and to debate his hair-less head after chemotherapy on his side.</seg>
<seg id="178">"therefore, the blocking of persons coming to the Governor's side is a public forum that is considered to be officially designated and by employees who are paid by public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="179">"in an interview with The Washington Post, Hogan spokeswoman Amelia Chasse defended the governor's actions and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderation."</seg>
<seg id="180">But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people that vibrate online the whip.</seg>
<seg id="181">The post spoke to some of the real people that were blocked by Hogan.</seg>
<seg id="182">"and these are only real people speaking with their elected leaders: a teacher, an entrepreneur and a priest, no trolls."</seg>
<seg id="183">"they all said that their comments were respectful, thoughtful and not profane."</seg>
<seg id="184">The pastor prayed the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan Catholic faith.</seg>
<seg id="185">"lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie, Md., was not bottled, but she asked for hate crimes."</seg>
<seg id="186">"I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news," she wrote in the commentary box of the news broadcast "The Post." "</seg>
<seg id="187">"I do not like this idea if a number of people take a position on the same subject, then they are disregarded by some rather as a so-called collective commitment and not recognized as a large group of affected citizens."</seg>
<seg id="188">"what the governor's staff called" concentrated spam "attack would probably call others" "intercession". ""</seg>
<seg id="189">The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or dropping a negative comment.</seg>
<seg id="190">"it is much cleaner than in earlier times, if one had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical items or to arrest demonstrators and silence them."</seg>
<seg id="191">But that exactly happens digitally.</seg>
<seg id="192">Hogan is not the first public official who criticises Facebook and other social media.</seg>
<seg id="193">President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed.</seg>
<seg id="194">One of the first milestones in this question fell last week in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="195">"the Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County passed the First Amendment, according to US District Judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria, when they banished a voter from their Facebook page."</seg>
<seg id="196">"and in Kentucky, Governor Matt Bevin (R) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="197">It should not be so difficult.</seg>
<seg id="198">"at the time of Washington, the time of affordable porting had a similar effect as the Internet."</seg>
<seg id="199">"the number of newspapers was multiplied between 1776 and 1800, and anonymous correspondence hits his lead."</seg>
<seg id="200">"and even then, Washington had anonymous trolls."</seg>
<seg id="201">"the people who used pseudonyms like" Juricola, "" Valerius, "" Belisarius "and" Portius, "wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington's decisions."</seg>
<seg id="202">"petitions who criticized his position on the treaty of Amity, trade and shipping with Great Britain overwhelmed his office, according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project."</seg>
<seg id="203">But he has not put them into silence.</seg>
<seg id="204">"freedom of speech, disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation."</seg>
<seg id="205">And true guidance means to accept that.</seg>
<seg id="206">Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club</seg>
<seg id="207">"the former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will be hoping for domestic comfort over the next three days, as the Renaissance club in East Lothian hosts the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open."</seg>
<seg id="208">"the Nordire, who last year led the Archerfield to the final round, before he lost Paul Eales, is connected to the new venue and acts as tournament ambassador in the name of the founder and CEOs Jerry Sarvadi."</seg>
<seg id="209">"I saw how the Renaissance club was built, and we see how he achieved his fame with this event," "said Rafferty."</seg>
<seg id="210">"players will see this course from its best side, it's in a great condition."</seg>
<seg id="211">Jerry made a great job when he fixed this place.</seg>
<seg id="212">He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here.</seg>
<seg id="213">This is a great showcase for this course. "</seg>
<seg id="214">"the Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time, although in his 32-year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour."</seg>
<seg id="215">"that feels really special," said the player based in Southport. "</seg>
<seg id="216">I couldn't defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won them.</seg>
<seg id="217">Coming back to this part of the world is magical.</seg>
<seg id="218">It is a wonderful place to play golf.</seg>
<seg id="219">"the memories of last year come back, and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win last year here."</seg>
<seg id="220">It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate.</seg>
<seg id="221">"Gary Orr, who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday this year, returns to the action on the home floor."</seg>
<seg id="222">This event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="223">"it always means a bit more when playing at home," Orr said, the man from Helensburgh. "</seg>
<seg id="224">"you want to do it well, but you also feel this extra pressure."</seg>
<seg id="225">I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf.</seg>
<seg id="226">I am happy about how much has gone.</seg>
<seg id="227">"with the trio on the field are the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major champion Paul Broadhurst, Roger Chapman, Mark James and Mark McNone."</seg>
<seg id="228">"the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance is among the six Scots in the field, the others are Andrew Oldcorn, Stephen McAllister, Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond."</seg>
<seg id="229">"admission is free, the car park costs £5 per car with an occupant and £10 per car with two or more passengers."</seg>

<seg id="466">"750 years of St. Hilarius Church: on the occasion of the anniversary of the Bergkirche, the old cemetery area in Tumlingen will be invited to a Serenade at 4.30 p.m. on Sunday 16 July."</seg>
<seg id="467">"whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village, the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay."</seg>
<seg id="468">The visitors of the 6th Benefiz Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place.</seg>
<seg id="469">The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made Tumlinois a cause for their concerns.</seg>
<seg id="470">Walter Martini emphasizes: "it is a unique village gem."</seg>
<seg id="471">"in 1267 the St. HilariusChapel was first mentioned in documents in the Württembergische Jahrbuch," Count Hermann von Sulz sold "the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogbey" at the Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver. "</seg>
<seg id="472">"according to the wording of the document, on the Hill of Tumour, besides the former parish church, there was also a beautiful courtyard where the church or the patron saint belonged and not the other way round."</seg>
<seg id="473">So there were also people there.</seg>
<seg id="474">"as from the description of the Oberamtes Freudenstadt from 1858, it was beside the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf that are still visible today in the town-picture of Tumlingen, the" mountain "of the third, the magnificent settlement-core of the village."</seg>
<seg id="475">Old maps dating back to 1600 reinforce these historical circumstances.</seg>
<seg id="476">The right of patronage arose from the early medieval church law.</seg>
<seg id="477">"a gentleman who built a church and occupied himself with a parish priest, remained owner of this church and could also bequeathed this church."</seg>
<seg id="478">This was associated with the right to use a pastor or to propose a new priest to the bishop.</seg>
<seg id="479">There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower.</seg>
<seg id="480">The elder of the two rocks at Christmas 1673.</seg>
<seg id="481">"the newly created bell sounded for the first time in 1692, but was later to be given in the Second World War in 1942."</seg>
<seg id="482">"in the Thirty Years' War (1616 to 1648), the windows were smashed and the bell pieces were stolen."</seg>
<seg id="483">The roof was leaky.</seg>
<seg id="484">1796 French troops camped near the church.</seg>
<seg id="485">They removed the pulpit and church chairs and used it as firewood.</seg>
<seg id="486">The remains of the church were threatened to fall in 1809.</seg>
<seg id="487">"until 1869, the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery served as the last resting place for the dead from Hörschweiler."</seg>
<seg id="488">In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche was abandoned.</seg>
<seg id="489">Only the church tower was left standing.</seg>
<seg id="490">In the New Year's Eve in 1834 a storm broke the church tower and half collapsed.</seg>
<seg id="491">"to prevent misfortune, the tower was abandoned."</seg>
<seg id="492">Only the tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness of the 750-year-old church history.</seg>

<seg id="864">"in the Ore Mountains, the triple chain is to be further optimized."</seg>

<seg id="867">Hoffmann is convinced that his team gets better after the experiences in preparation with the triple chain than with the quadruped.</seg>
<seg id="868">"still I don't know how we will act in Aue," says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel, but Hoffmann is confident in his case, "because we have just been able to build up on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann who can build up well," Hoffmann said. "</seg>
<seg id="869">"the prerequisite is, however, that we are even better harmonizing and we don't have so many playing mistakes in building up."</seg>

<seg id="875">"the start of the season will only be judged after six to eight days of play," said Friedhelm Funkel, who doesn't want to talk about an advantage against Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim prematurely had to be cancelled because of a thunderstorm. "</seg>
<seg id="876">"now they can start the season almost with a home game," said Funkel and Hoffmann, that the players from Aue might even be a bit more fresh because they wouldn't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a ascension favorite in the bones. "</seg>
<seg id="877">"but they don't know about 100 percent where they are at the moment," "says the inner defense of Fortuna."</seg>
<seg id="878">"the guests from the Rhineland, as a light favourite on Sunday, go to the meeting at the finally (almost) finished stadium of Aue."</seg>
<seg id="879">"that we sweep them away, just because we have the right to come under the first six is bullshit," says Funkel, whose record is quite positive with only one defeat against Aue from nine games. "</seg>
<seg id="880">"there is no squad in the 2nd Bundesliga which you have to hit from the start," explains Fortunas's chief coach. "</seg>

<seg id="889">"in 432 cases, the conclusion that the person" may be under 18 years of age. "</seg>
<seg id="890">The tests are performed only in cases where the age of the person is questioned.</seg>
<seg id="891">"according to Johan Goransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency, the results have been consistent over the past few months."</seg>
<seg id="892">"we see no big difference in the statistics of the past few months, the numbers are fairly constant," he said the magazine The Local. "</seg>
<seg id="893">The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers have lied over their age.</seg>

<seg id="933">"the parties represented in the volcanic Eifel (CDU, SPD, Grüne, FDP, FWG, Left) belong to a broad alliance that shows a peaceful flag this day because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle invites Rondell according to the poster" "big election campaign". ""</seg>

<seg id="992">"CoE praises" "honest" "Russian apology for doping scandal"</seg>
<seg id="993">"the global leader of athletics, Sebastian Coe, praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal, but he repeated it was not the moment for the country to be resumed into the sport."</seg>
<seg id="994">Russian athletics boss Dmitry Shylakhtin said during IAAF congresses on the eve of the World Athletics Championships that the exile of his country was correct from sports and that he was determined to fight the doping.</seg>
<seg id="995">"he said," "I'm sorry for" "all the athletes who were grabbed gold and silver medals at competitions."</seg>
<seg id="996">"despite its comments, the IAAF congress voted for the maintenance of the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) had found evidence on state-sponsored doping in Russia."</seg>
<seg id="997">"I thought it was a very open response today, a very honest presentation," "said IAAF President Coe to the reporters."</seg>
<seg id="998">The entire Council and the entire Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation has recognized in itself that it has experienced some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is redesigned.</seg>
<seg id="999">CoE said he was also "pleased" that Russia accepted the criteria for its re-establishment.</seg>
<seg id="1000">"I think it was a very constructive day, and I think that progress has been made, but Congress supports the recommendations of the Task Force that this is not the moment to re-use Russia again," said Coe. "</seg>
<seg id="1001">We have to do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation.</seg>
<seg id="1002">"the guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the corrupted system," he added. "</seg>

<seg id="1121">How the Football Fiscal Rules affect Neymar's move to Paris</seg>
<seg id="1122">The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditures of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar's world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain.</seg>
<seg id="1123">"any consequences will be made for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA, as the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to prohibit teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League tournament."</seg>
<seg id="1124">"financial Fair Play rules, launched in 2011 by the UEFA, mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the transfer from Neymar was funded with no major losses."</seg>
<seg id="1125">"Barcelona has paid 222 million euros (262 million dollars) to get the Brazilian out of its contract, and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars a year."</seg>
<seg id="1126">Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar's move to France.</seg>
<seg id="1127">PSG can surely make the money loose so that Neymar underwrites and bring it into a galaxy of other stars in the face of the financing of the team by the power of the rich lord of Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1128">"clubs are allowed to spend a lot of money on the purchase of players, but have to counteract legitimate objections that allow them to break the break even point in their business-related business."</seg>
<seg id="1129">"FFP was designed by Michel Platini in 2007, following his election as the UEFA President."</seg>
<seg id="1130">"the former French player believed that clubs who had huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risking to ruin themselves, when banks or owners withdrew their support."</seg>
<seg id="1131">"in 2011, FFP shifted from concentration to the debt of the clubs to monitor their losses."</seg>
<seg id="1132">"the change meant that the business model, which Roman Abramovich used in 2003 in Chelsea, bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - to become a harder issue."</seg>
<seg id="1133">"during the current three-year period of FFP, which runs until 2018, clubs can take losses of 30 million euros."</seg>
<seg id="1134">"although Platini has fallen from the Presidency of the Presidency in 2015, his successor, Aleksander Ceferin, will continue to discourage from excessive spending."</seg>
<seg id="1135">"surely FFP is not dead and we will reinforce the rules for the future," "said Andrea Traverso, who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP, compared to The Associated Press last week."</seg>
<seg id="1136">"although PSG paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a flat rate, it can distribute the amount for billing over the duration of its contract."</seg>
<seg id="1137">"Neymar has signed a five-year contract, so that the sales revenue can be reported for the next five years amounting to EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial statements."</seg>
<seg id="1138">"the first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 brought the PSG together with Abu Dhabi, which is owned by Manchester City, with the heaviest sanctions."</seg>
<seg id="1139">"PSG received a fine of 60 million euros (at that time 82 million dollars), which was later reduced to 20 million euros - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players."</seg>
<seg id="1140">UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlay their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies connected to the owners of a club.</seg>
<seg id="1141">"while a katargic company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsoring should exceed the standard market rates, UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income."</seg>
<seg id="1142">This happened in 2014 when the UEFA decided that the value of sponsoring the PSA was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority.</seg>
<seg id="1143">It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</seg>
<seg id="1144">But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar's World Cup ambassadors will be able to figure out such maneuver for UEFA regulators.</seg>
<seg id="1145">The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to ignore any attempt to bypass the rules.</seg>
<seg id="1146">"UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer, on Thursday the people who were familiar with the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1147">They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation.</seg>
<seg id="1148">The latest published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than €10 million with a turnover of €542.4 million.</seg>
<seg id="1149">The accounts for the last financial year must still be published.</seg>

<seg id="1151">The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing.</seg>
<seg id="1152">"the Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players, and she tried to prevent Neymar's way by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP."</seg>
<seg id="1153">"it is a clear case of" financial doping "with the club and the state," said the president of La League, Javier Tebas, the Spanish daily AS in relation to Katar's final ownership on PSG. "</seg>

<seg id="1155">"it is the consequence of the ownership and that has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years," said Wenger on Thursday. "</seg>
<seg id="1156">"as soon as a country owns a society, everything is possible."</seg>

<seg id="1158">Swiss is looking for a new creator supplier</seg>
<seg id="1159">"over the past few years, Chocolat Frey has manufactured board chocolate for Swiss."</seg>
<seg id="1160">Now the sweet co-operation is at a possible end: the airline writes the order again.</seg>
<seg id="1161">"Swiss-spokeswoman Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a report of the newspaper" "Nordwestschweiz" "on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="1162">"according to current planning, the airline will complete a new contract in the first half of 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1163">The products would be checked every two or three years and subjected to quality control.</seg>

<seg id="1166">Swiss Life did not want to provide any information about the cost.</seg>
<seg id="1167">"industry insider estimates the volume of orders according to" "Northwestern Switzerland" "at 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs."</seg>
<seg id="1168">But more important is the advertising effect: it is a prestigious order for a shock maker.</seg>
<seg id="1169">Swiss will not be able to betray how many applicants exist in the new call for tenders.</seg>
<seg id="1170">"in question, however, only Swiss manufacturers are concerned."</seg>
<seg id="1171">"according to the newspaper report, Chocolat Frey will endeavour to revise the contract beyond the Spring of 2018."</seg>

<seg id="1184">"this repetition of history is also nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s, for the 90-year Grunge era (as the thinkers David Wain and Michael Showalter the Sketch comedy" The State "for MTV), and for himself - that is, for 2001, before their stars, such as Elizabeth Banks, Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, went to greater things."</seg>
<seg id="1185">"as a cultural artifact, it is equally a parody and embodiment of our Facebook-capable era of permanent memories."</seg>
<seg id="1186">But as franchise it feels like time is scarce.</seg>
<seg id="1187">"first Day of Camp" worked surprisingly well, not only because of his absurd Humors (it contained an original story for a talking sweet vegetables that was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin). "</seg>

<seg id="1190">"one point pulls a character through an Apple powerbook, some inline skates and" a number of other things from 1991. "</seg>
<seg id="1191">Many of the central stories are the same.</seg>
<seg id="1192">"the lovely Coop (Mr. Showalter), now Romanautor, has not forgotten Katie (Marguerite Moreau)."</seg>
<seg id="1193">Victor (Ken Marino) has not lost his virginity.</seg>
<seg id="1194">There is another crazy-vicious Plot involved in Ronald Reagan (also Mr. Showalter) who is now supported by George H. W. Bush (a good impression of Michael Ian Black).</seg>
<seg id="1195">"as always, the exams are the best part of the franchise."</seg>
<seg id="1196">"it is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd, who shows Matt Dillons's sublicking style of" Singles, "whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy."</seg>
<seg id="1197">"there are the moments of random madness that could heighten this franchise as a kind of repetitive" Seven Up! "series until he reaches what I considered his logical conclusion:" "wet Hot American Summer: Twenty Years Later", "whose last scene will show the movie premiere of" "Wet Hot American Summer". ""</seg>
<seg id="1198">"meanwhile," Comrade Detective "on Amazon reminds of another type of nostalgia: the revival of the Cold War of" The Americans, "to the film" Atomic Blonde, "and even to" GLOW, "with its East-West-West-war iconography."</seg>

<seg id="1201">It is a brilliant idea.</seg>
<seg id="1202">But it is not much more than an idea.</seg>
<seg id="1203">There are some nice gags to look at (the police spends the time watching chess on television as Americans might do with football).</seg>
<seg id="1204">"and the list of famous actors - including Jenny Slate, Nick Offerman, Mahershala Ali and Chloe Sevigny - provides a decent game 'Find out the voice'."</seg>
<seg id="1205">But "Comrade Detective" is so much engaged in the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan's mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one.</seg>
<seg id="1206">"with six long episodes, it withdraws and the comedy is not fast or frequent."</seg>
<seg id="1207">"Comrade Detective, who was rearranged for a lower length, could better deliver his Agitprop satire, since Gregor and Iosef constantly visit the American embassy, whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a bunch of hamburgers."</seg>

<seg id="1210">Strike against drug mafia in the country</seg>
<seg id="1211">The police have succeeded in a strike against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg.</seg>
<seg id="1212">"on Wednesday morning, in the Black Forest-Baar district, in Rottweil, Constance, Esslingen and Stuttgart many objects were searched, as the public prosecutor Konstanz informed on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="1213">"at the same time, 15 defendants were arrested at the age of 25 and 77 years old and issued arrest warrants against them."</seg>
<seg id="1214">"the officials also assured large quantities of marijuana and cocaine, firearms as well as several hundred thousand euros."</seg>
<seg id="1215">Two people were arrested during the same period of time in Italy.</seg>
<seg id="1216">There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects.</seg>
<seg id="1217">The two will probably be extradited to Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1218">Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action.</seg>
<seg id="1219">"in total, more than 300 policemen were in use."</seg>
<seg id="1220">"the Mafia members are accused of organised drug criminality, heavy acts of violence, attempted murder, robbery and blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="1221">"since the summer of 2016, the public prosecutor's office established consistency against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany."</seg>
<seg id="1222">Between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily.</seg>
<seg id="1223">"therefore, the large-scale operation on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officers from Palermo."</seg>
<seg id="1224">The aim of the investigation was mainly Italian nationals with close relation to the Italian mafia.</seg>

<seg id="1229">"according to a media report, the Commissioner responsible for the refugee management of the Federal Government, Frank-Jürgen Weise, pointed to large gaps in the immigration centre register."</seg>
<seg id="1230">"shortcomings in the data recorded there may lead to partly serious misdecisions in the case of asylum procedures and deportations, in an analysis published by the Süddeutsche Zeitung."</seg>
<seg id="1231">"according to the data, ten million people with foreign nationality are registered in the register, including 5,7 million from non-EU countries."</seg>
<seg id="1232">The data is therefore managed by approximately 600 immigration authorities in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="1233">"because the data had not been adequately maintained, the quality of data in parts has not been good so far."</seg>
<seg id="1234">"data from 1921 have been found in individual cases," "by people who are no longer alive, or citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register any more."</seg>
<seg id="1235">"faulty data input can significantly slow reversal processes," "says the report."</seg>
<seg id="1236">"in the statistics on adequate people, moreover, EU citizens are captured who have not had to travel at all."</seg>
<seg id="1237">"such false orders, however, led to a distorted debate on how to deal with sufficient funds," according to the analysis. "</seg>
<seg id="1238">"meanwhile, the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families back to Italy with 16-year-old children when they came from there."</seg>
<seg id="1239">"this comes from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF), reports the" Neue Osnabrück Zeitung. ""</seg>

<seg id="1262">The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25%</seg>
<seg id="1263">"the Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged, after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have dampened speculation about an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1264">The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain sluggish when it kept interest rates on family income in the middle of a growing pressure.</seg>
<seg id="1265">"the Bank's political decision-makers voted with 6 to 2 to hold the interest rates to 0.25%, whereas in this month fewer members were reluctant to increase as the weak economic growth weakened the support for an increase."</seg>
<seg id="1266">"in its quarterly inflation report, the Bank reduced its growth forecast for 2017 to 1.7% and rose to 1.6% for 2018 and warned that the pressure on domestic revenues would continue to rise to just under 3% in autumn."</seg>
<seg id="1267">"but it signalized that in the next few years, interest increases would be necessary to curb the inflation heated by the Brexit, and it said that lending costs would have to rise more than expected in the financial markets."</seg>
<seg id="1268">"the members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammoth economic stimulus package, issued a year after the Brexit."</seg>
<seg id="1269">"it will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the coming February, even though it was said that it is now expected to make 15 billion pounds available within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds sterling."</seg>
<seg id="1270">"after deciding on the interest rate, the Bank said:" in the central prognosis of the MPC, the gross domestic product (GDP) remains weak in the short term, as the pressure on the real income of households still burdened the consumption. "</seg>
<seg id="1271">"at the interest rates, it reiterated that" a certain tightening of monetary policy "would be needed to cool inflation and a" greater "scale than the markets expect."</seg>
<seg id="1272">The markets currently forecast the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020.</seg>
<seg id="1273">"the Bank emphasised however that increases would be" "gradual" "and" "limited". ""</seg>
<seg id="1274">The Bank's growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9% and 1.7% forecast in May.</seg>
<seg id="1275">It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8% in 2018.</seg>
<seg id="1276">The Pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro.</seg>
<seg id="1277">The pound dropped by 0.5% to 1.31 US dollars and dropped by 0.4% to 1.11 euros.</seg>
<seg id="1278">"the decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures dampened the rising expectations of interest rate, and GDP in the second quarter of 0.2% in the previous three months has risen to 0.3%."</seg>
<seg id="1279">"growth will likely be 0.3% in the third quarter, although it will recover slightly after the Bank at the end of the year."</seg>
<seg id="1280">"the recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and marginal remuneration, as the sharpening is getting worse first before it gets better."</seg>
<seg id="1281">"she added that monetary policy in the coming years cannot" "prevent" "incomes", "but she added that the wages at the end of her three year forecast can be" "clear". ""</seg>
<seg id="1282">"the economy is also strengthened by the rising demand for British goods, which is attributable to the weak pound, which will compensate for a portion of the lower consumption expenditure."</seg>
<seg id="1283">"the decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25% last August following the shocking EU vote, which caused the sinking of the pact."</seg>
<seg id="1284">The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years until this will fully reach the prices and the economy.</seg>
<seg id="1285">"before the Bank's final verdict on interest rates, the call for interest rate increased, as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households, with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5% in July."</seg>
<seg id="1286">"inflation in the past month fell from 2.9% in June to 2.6%, although the bank said it was expected to attract it again in the coming months."</seg>
<seg id="1287">The Bank said that the excess in proportion to its target of 2% was "quite" attributable to the weak pound.</seg>
<seg id="1288">"Andrew Montlake, director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers, said:" in view of the recent swap rates, the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again, as the creditors are looking for business and want to end the year in a positive way. "</seg>
<seg id="1289">"the market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals run out and the new mortgages complete, and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular."</seg>
<seg id="1290">NHS (National Health Service) urged to prescribe the controversial HIV drug of 10.000 people</seg>
<seg id="1291">Patients will receive access to a "transformative" HIV prevention treatment in September after a fight against the High Court against financing the drug in the NHS.</seg>
<seg id="1292">"NHS England announced that pre-sex preexposure prophylaxis (prep), which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 percent, is now delivered by the health service via a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people."</seg>
<seg id="1293">"he agreed to finance the trial after the Court of Appeal confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court last year, according to which the NHS had the authority to pay for the prep in spite of the claim that the local authorities should finance it."</seg>
<seg id="1294">"announced on Thursday, NHS England CEO Simon Stevens was welcomed as an" "important new intervention", "while the National AIDS Trust (NAT) described this as a" decisive moment. ""</seg>
<seg id="1295">"sexual health clinics in London, Brighton, Manchester, Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register, and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1296">Preexposure prophylaxis (prep) is a result of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1297">Studies have shown that prep significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection risk.</seg>
<seg id="1298">Taking prep before intercourse means that just enough drugs are present in the body of a person to prevent an HIV infection.</seg>
<seg id="1299">Such medicines may be taken every day or so already two hours before sexual intercourse.</seg>
<seg id="1300">"those who come into question for the treatment include gay or bisexual men, transsexual and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated."</seg>
<seg id="1301">"suitable candidates are identified in clinics who agree to the study, including men, women, transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment."</seg>
<seg id="1302">Individuals who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also opt-in for possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic.</seg>
<seg id="1303">The program is subscribed to £10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the drugs this week after an international competitive procurement.</seg>
<seg id="1304">"the study aims to assess the entire prep potential by collecting clinical evidence, as used in a large scale, and implemented."</seg>
<seg id="1305">Stevens said: "this great new intervention should supplement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV.</seg>
<seg id="1306">It is another milestone in the progress lasting more than three decades in coping with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity. "</seg>
<seg id="1307">"Deborah Gold, Chief Executive at NAT (National AIDS Trust) said:" "this is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV."</seg>
<seg id="1308">"prep, aimed specifically in vulnerable and vulnerable people, offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic."</seg>
<seg id="1309">"from September onwards, people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner, leading to the improvement of many, many lives."</seg>
<seg id="1310">We warmly welcome this announcement. "</seg>
<seg id="1311">"Ian Green, CEO of the Terrence Higgins Trust, said:" the priority must now be that the study will be carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk for HIV will be left behind. "</seg>
<seg id="1312">"now that prep test medicine has been procured, we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people."</seg>
<seg id="1313">"Sharon Hodgson, Shadow Minister of Health, said:" "the beginning of the prep process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation."</seg>
<seg id="1314">The evidence shows how transformative this drug may be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection.</seg>
<seg id="1315">This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of prep.</seg>
<seg id="1316">"now it is important that this study is carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are HIV-infected, and that it will contribute to the termination of the spread of HIV in society."</seg>
<seg id="1317">Living a great life: mezzanine and clever designer tricks turned this little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home</seg>
<seg id="1318">"Joanne Leigh, a former bankress with a passion for real estate, resigned from a big house in Knightsbridge to Earls Court Apartment in 2014."</seg>
<seg id="1319">It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags.</seg>
<seg id="1320">"before that I lived in a much larger room with my ex in Knightsbridge," says Joanne. "</seg>
<seg id="1321">I was looking for something comparable to my price.</seg>
<seg id="1322">I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings.</seg>
<seg id="1323">I fell in love with them and made an offer this day. "</seg>
<seg id="1324">"since the first inspection, the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely overhauled."</seg>
<seg id="1325">Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add storage space and a mezzanine to make use of the generous ceiling height.</seg>
<seg id="1326">"I wanted high ceilings, large windows, plenty of light."</seg>
<seg id="1327">"that was my request," "she says."</seg>
<seg id="1328">"for this purpose, she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi in Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1329">"the ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on top of each other, so that the architectural challenge consisted in creating an intermediate floor in which one could stand."</seg>
<seg id="1330">Erfan had to think creatively to solve the requirement.</seg>
<seg id="1331">"the steel work is rather complicated," he explains. "</seg>
<seg id="1332">"we had to arrange the rooms in such a way, that they were stacked on top of each other without having to bend."</seg>
<seg id="1333">"it was not only about building a simple platform, but to put the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below."</seg>
<seg id="1334">This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama.</seg>
<seg id="1335">"for the mezzanine, a classic copper-light window from Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area."</seg>
<seg id="1336">"mirrored gold pieces, silver accents and vintage Serge Moulin lighting set the style for the program."</seg>
<seg id="1337">"the use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater, space and light."</seg>
<seg id="1338">"on both ends, a short corridor is mirrored to allow him to work longer."</seg>
<seg id="1339">"in the kitchen, the mirroring feels like a window into another room."</seg>
<seg id="1340">"at the entrance, mirrored units provide space for all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne."</seg>
<seg id="1341">"through the perception of a glamorous space, the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen when it is not used."</seg>
<seg id="1342">Foldable kitchens are nothing new.</seg>
<seg id="1343">The special thing about this is that it is a garage door.</seg>
<seg id="1344">"a bit of engineering came in," explains Erfan of the reinforced, veneered MDF door. "</seg>
<seg id="1345">"it is important, so when you push the door, it slides very easily."</seg>
<seg id="1346">"thanks to the clever use of space and storage space, Joanne could gain additional 16 m ², an additional bedroom and an improved layout."</seg>
<seg id="1347">"at the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is estimated," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1348">"in a rudimentary form, a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the ground size."</seg>
<seg id="1349">"here, they managed to enlarge the floor space and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage."</seg>
<seg id="1350">"the materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home," says Erfan. "</seg>
<seg id="1351">"you don't love the electrical sockets in the walls.</seg>
<seg id="1352">"these are important, but they do not play with your heart."</seg>
<seg id="1353">It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meter number of some standard in something quite amazing.</seg>
<seg id="1354">"in fact, like Joanne, you could decide not to leave it."</seg>
<seg id="1355">Brothers fight for a $500 million real estate empire</seg>

<seg id="1358">"Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014, but a sharp discussion of the separation takes place in the Supreme Court."</seg>
<seg id="1359">"together with her mother Anna, the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars, since the 1973 family bought a shop at Smith Street, Collingwood."</seg>
<seg id="1360">"there, the Westco family founded jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores."</seg>
<seg id="1361">It was sold in 1999 for 85 million US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1362">"this money was invested in real estate, and De Lutis portfolio now covers offices in the city centre, the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento, the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping malls in the suburbs."</seg>
<seg id="1363">"after an agreement with her deceased father, Colin - by Paul as" principal operator and the dominant personality "in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of the company's assets and Paul about one-third."</seg>
<seg id="1364">"according to a court file, this means that Colin property has a value of $316 million and Paul worth $176 million."</seg>
<seg id="1365">The division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul.</seg>
<seg id="1366">"the divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects," he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit. "</seg>
<seg id="1367">"last Friday, after several failed negotiations, the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place."</seg>
<seg id="1368">"the brothers now also fight for control of the existing business - of which Colin, as Paul claims, excluded him."</seg>
<seg id="1369">"Colin argues that this is not true, but tells Paul to manage some possessions incompetently."</seg>
<seg id="1370">"in an early Affidavit submitted by Colin, he says he hopes to settle the dispute."</seg>
<seg id="1371">"my Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1372">"the costs are in the fall, with hundreds of pages with affidavits, emails and reports from companies, including Deloitte, Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer, and with leading lawyers, including Allan Myers, QC, and both parties held by law firms."</seg>
<seg id="1373">"Mrs. De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants, who operated milk bars and delicatessen in the late 1950s and bought a shop in Brunswick in the early seventies."</seg>
<seg id="1374">"they used security to buy the Collingwood property, in which Colin opened the first Jeannings of the family."</seg>
<seg id="1375">Colin says he started Westco when he was "in my last years of high school when Paul was still a little child (about 10 years old).</seg>
<seg id="1376">"Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi, who died in 2012, hoped to pass on their property to their sons."</seg>
<seg id="1377">"Luigi repeatedly said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court," "she wrote."</seg>
<seg id="1378">"two other brothers, Mark and Luke, are no longer part of the De Lutis group, Colin claims that at leaving the company $10 million and Luke 26 million dollars were paid."</seg>
<seg id="1379">"both Luke and Mark were," "Paul says about the conditions of their financial separation."</seg>
<seg id="1380">Colin has kept himself very close even though he was a former AFL board member and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star.</seg>
<seg id="1381">Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers.</seg>
<seg id="1382">"just Colin answered by SMS to say" "I can't really say much," "because the case is before the courts."</seg>
<seg id="1383">"it is very, very sad, that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts," he wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="1384">"in the middle of 2016, Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother's demands."</seg>
<seg id="1385">"our father would not have wanted Paul and me to end up in our current fight," "he said, adding that he" still hope for a solution. ""</seg>

<seg id="1388">The Trump appointed new Chief of Staff to limit the media abstinence of the President.</seg>
<seg id="1389">Others have tried and failed.</seg>
<seg id="1390">Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it.</seg>
<seg id="1391">"if so, he will be the first."</seg>
<seg id="1392">"Politico reports that the White House staff head is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump, including reports from the news media - hoping to keep the boss on a more discounted rate."</seg>
<seg id="1393">Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey:</seg>
<seg id="1394">"when John F. Kelly, the new Chief of Staff of the White House, met with senior employees on his first day of work, he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump White House which he wanted to repair: poor information that got into the hands of the president."</seg>
<seg id="1395">Kelly said that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he would receive good information.</seg>
<seg id="1396">Kellys diagnosis makes sense but others have tried to tame trump by monitoring its media diet.</seg>
<seg id="1397">"President Trump's relationship with television reaches decades back - and now, where he is at the White House, his TV advertising is still strong."</seg>
<seg id="1398">"if the candidate Trump was angry because of unfair reporting, it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were too convincing," "said the former election campaign advisor Sam Nunberg in February towards Politico."</seg>
<seg id="1399">"politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that" the key to keep Trump Twitter habit under control, according to six former election campaigns officials, insists that his personal media consumption involves a steady lobbying. "</seg>
<seg id="1400">Okay.</seg>
<seg id="1401">But the idea that Trump's Twitter habit was ever "under control" is ridiculous.</seg>
<seg id="1402">Perhaps these campaign officials know something we don't know yet - that Trump Tweets would have included even more combustibles without their intervention.</seg>
<seg id="1403">We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent.</seg>
<seg id="1404">"if his employees manage to keep his anger away from him a few times, their efforts have paid off."</seg>
<seg id="1405">But no one has consistently avoided that Trump Controversies cause controversy.</seg>
<seg id="1406">"part of the problem is that people in a White House, composed of competing parties, are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world."</seg>
<seg id="1407">"Politico - busy with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers, the president for strategic reasons doubting dubious information."</seg>
<seg id="1408">This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher:</seg>
<seg id="1409">"current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to negative press cuts, especially those with damaged leaks, and that he can find out where they come from."</seg>
<seg id="1410">"this was exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the president of a copy of an article by Gottar.com, the website of Internet provocate Charles C. Johnson, who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh," to be the source behind a heap of being "in the White House."</seg>
<seg id="1411">"although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of chicans, or that he offered no concrete evidence, or that he sold false allegations in the past and revoked them."</seg>
<seg id="1412">Trump read the article and started asking employees about Walsh.</seg>
<seg id="1413">"Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary General of the White House, Rob Porter, have tried to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork, the Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1414">How did that work?</seg>
<seg id="1415">Kelly tries to do the same three months later.</seg>
<seg id="1416">"perhaps he will prove himself as a more effective manager than Priebus, but Trump is still his impulsive self, and his advisors are still striving for influence."</seg>
<seg id="1417">These immutable factors make Kellys mission very difficult.</seg>

<seg id="1420">The police across Europe sent postcards to dangerous criminals during this summer (virtual) postcards.</seg>
<seg id="1421">"since the addresses of the most sought-after burglars are not known naturally, references from the population will be hoped and asked."</seg>

<seg id="1428">"some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are again with some determined travellers on the foot of the war, who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the commune in order to reclaim a field in front of their mansion houses."</seg>
<seg id="1429">"travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside of a prosperous road from Solihull, which is called the" millionaire series. ""</seg>
<seg id="1430">"they brought horses, babies and an army of vans, after they were thrown out only in May, without being deterred by a digging dug by the Council to prevent their seizures."</seg>
<seg id="1431">The tactful group found a gap in the defense units and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way.</seg>
<seg id="1432">"angry residents have pushed the Council of Solihull, who said it was" useless to deal with the problem. "</seg>
<seg id="1433">"an anonymous inhabitant said:" "they went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath, where they threw stones on the passers-by."</seg>
<seg id="1434">"the Council must be forced through shame to implement it, as it was useless to deal with the problem."</seg>
<seg id="1435">The travellers were there in May and were moved forward and are now back.</seg>
<seg id="1436">"more came yesterday evening, probably more today."</seg>
<seg id="1437">"she added:" "the Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks."</seg>
<seg id="1438">"I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community, if the Council does not even stop."</seg>
<seg id="1439">"a local who did not want to be named said:" "it is ridiculous, we have just seen the last round of these travelers, only to be plundered by another round."</seg>
<seg id="1440">The figures have increased this time and even a horse is seen in the park area. "</seg>
<seg id="1441">"a spokeswoman of Solihull of Solihull said:" "we are aware of an unauthorised camp on the land beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihull. we take the necessary legal steps so that they can move on as soon as possible."</seg>

<seg id="1444">Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise</seg>
<seg id="1445">The Waldhotel Luise is located in the former Hotel Birkenhof.</seg>
<seg id="1446">The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently undergoing renovation and is scheduled to be reopened on 1 March next year.</seg>
<seg id="1447">These are good news for the city.</seg>
<seg id="1448">"because with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente company company mbH on April 13, 2014, some 30,000 overnight stays per year were lost and income from the local tax."</seg>
<seg id="1449">"in the autumn of 2014, in view of the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees arriving to the administrative district, the hotel building was offered to the administrative office as a collective shelter, which provided controversial discussions."</seg>
<seg id="1450">The city prevented the placing of asylum seekers by setting up a development plan to secure the area as a hotel location.</seg>
<seg id="1451">"at that time, the decision was not undisputed in the Municipal Council."</seg>
<seg id="1452">"but especially Freudenstadt's mayor, Julian Osswald, defended the hotel location and spoke of serious prospects at that time."</seg>
<seg id="1453">He should be right.</seg>
<seg id="1454">The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer with registered office in Bad Bergzabern has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise.</seg>
<seg id="1455">The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object.</seg>
<seg id="1456">Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb.</seg>
<seg id="1457">"welcome to Hotel Luise, Luisenpark, Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise."</seg>
<seg id="1458">"the former Hotel Birkenhof has been standing in front of the entrance for a long time already, and when you enter the house it becomes clear that extensive renovations are carried out."</seg>
<seg id="1459">"the floors were torn out, ceilings partly dismantled, old bathtubs removed from the rooms."</seg>
<seg id="1460">The entire hotel building is a single building site.</seg>
<seg id="1461">There is still much to do until March.</seg>
<seg id="1462">"it is actually a nice place," says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper. "</seg>
<seg id="1463">Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style.</seg>
<seg id="1464">"the rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers, the entrance area is redesigned, new windows are installed."</seg>
<seg id="1465">"everything should be" "pretty" "later, as Thomas Scherer says."</seg>
<seg id="1466">"we want to make a piece of jewellery out of it."</seg>
<seg id="1467">"swimming pool, wellness area and a meeting room belong to the facilities."</seg>
<seg id="1468">"they do not want to position themselves at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad, but already at a higher inner city level, Scherer emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="1469">"the Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide, explains Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1470">"individual vacationers, groups or business people should feel comfortable at the hotel."</seg>
<seg id="1471">"he has already been talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourist Director Michael Krause, says Scherer."</seg>
<seg id="1472">The city's performances are similar to those of the hotel group.</seg>
<seg id="1473">"we are on the same line."</seg>
<seg id="1474">"according to the amount of investments, Thomas Scherer doesn't want to determine exactly."</seg>
<seg id="1475">"just below a million euros, he reckons."</seg>
<seg id="1476">"the outer systems are also brought onto the front man, which is already clearly visible."</seg>
<seg id="1477">"in a courtyard, there is a large terrace, which is accessible by the restaurant, which is open to the public."</seg>
<seg id="1478">Thomas Scherer is optimistic: "Freudenstadt is a good market."</seg>
<seg id="1479">Russia affair: US Special Enlargement sets up Grand Jury</seg>
<seg id="1480">"in the Russia affair around US President Donald Trump, Special Agent Robert Mueller was said to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report."</seg>
<seg id="1481">"over the past few weeks, the body has been working on the work, wrote the Wall Street Journal, calling on people familiar with the matter."</seg>
<seg id="1482">The paper presented the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified its investigations.</seg>
<seg id="1483">The CNN station reported that there are already first invitations of the body in connection with a meeting between the Trump elder son and a Russian lawyer.</seg>
<seg id="1484">"for some time now, U.S. intelligence services accuse the Kremlin to intervene deliberately in the 2016 presidential campaign."</seg>
<seg id="1485">Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between the Trump campaign team and Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="1486">"in the focus of the investigation, several men are supposed to stand in the election campaign as advisors to the republicans."</seg>
<seg id="1487">"according to reports, Mueller took a closer look at more and more Trumps's private and business environment."</seg>
<seg id="1488">"a few weeks ago, the" Washington Post "wrote that the Special Encounter Trump has personally moved to the centre and investigates whether the president could possibly obstruct the judiciary in the course of the affair."</seg>
<seg id="1489">The main task of Grand jurys is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether they should be charged.</seg>
<seg id="1490">Grand Jurys are therefore also called Indictments.</seg>
<seg id="1491">"most of the time, they are turned on when they are larger and controversial cases."</seg>
<seg id="1492">The procedure is always followed behind closed doors.</seg>
<seg id="1493">The board can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to charge persons under oath.</seg>
<seg id="1494">"according to the CNN, charges have already been issued that revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer."</seg>
<seg id="1495">People who were involved in the meeting were called upon to say a statement called it in the report.</seg>
<seg id="1496">"in addition, they should provide documents."</seg>
<seg id="1497">"in addition to Trump Jr., Trump Consultants and son-in-law Jared Kushner as well as his former election leader Paul Manafort were in the conversation."</seg>
<seg id="1498">"legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the introduction shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated in his work, and that if necessary, he wants to act quickly."</seg>
<seg id="1499">"however, it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of an indictment."</seg>
<seg id="1500">"nevertheless, the establishment of the committee is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause of concern for President Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1501">"in the midst of the new revelations, the president on Thursday evening used a speech in West Virginia to show the Russia affair as a campaign of its political opponents."</seg>
<seg id="1502">"the Russia story is a total invention," "said Trump."</seg>
<seg id="1503">"the subject gives the Democrats an opportunity to" "feel good" "because they have nothing else to talk about."</seg>
<seg id="1504">His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in a statement that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury.</seg>
<seg id="1505">"but they usually work in secret," "he stressed."</seg>
<seg id="1506">The White House advocates all measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a "fair" way.</seg>
<seg id="1507">Former FBI director James Comey said three times not to be ascertained against the president.</seg>
<seg id="1508">"there is no reason to assume that something has changed, it was said in the declaration."</seg>
<seg id="1509">But Mueller had only been used after Trump had fired Comey.</seg>
<seg id="1510">"because of this rooting, accusations against Trump have become loud, he challenged the judiciary."</seg>
<seg id="1511">"in June, Comey said before a Senate Committee, Trump asked him to set up an investigation against the National Security Advisor Michael Flynn."</seg>
<seg id="1512">The president is under great pressure for the investigation.</seg>
<seg id="1513">"after the presentation of US media, the White House gathered material against the Special Encounter and its employees."</seg>
<seg id="1514">This triggered speculation about whether Trump Mueller wanted to release Mueller.</seg>
<seg id="1515">"unlike an independent investigator of Congress such as the Watergate affair about the later retired President Richard Nixon, Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired on the urge of the President of the Ministry of Justice."</seg>
<seg id="1516">"however, several Senators of both parties want to prevent such a step."</seg>
<seg id="1517">Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators proposed legislation on Thursday that the Special Agent could no longer be dismissed as easily.</seg>
<seg id="1518">Antarctic: gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica</seg>
<seg id="1519">"in the west Antarctic, a gigantic iceberg of the barely seven-fold size of Berlin has been solved by the Schelven."</seg>
<seg id="1520">This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener-Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday.</seg>
<seg id="1521">"the colossus of about one trillion tons and 5800 square kilometres driving now to the north and will probably need two, three years until it melted."</seg>
<seg id="1522">"with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres, it is one of the largest glaciers that have registered in the past three decades."</seg>
<seg id="1523">There is no danger to man from him.</seg>
<seg id="1524">"to what extent climate change has played a role in the departure of the iceberg, it is unclear after research data."</seg>
<seg id="1525">"all in all, however, for some 30 years, there have been a series of unusual collapses of ice creams in the region, writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice (NSIDC) in a fact background."</seg>
<seg id="1526">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="1527">The now severed colossus has so far been a part of the Larsen-C-Schelven.</seg>
<seg id="1528">Schelven is floating on the sea and is fed by large glaciers.</seg>
<seg id="1529">It grows ever further into the sea and breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1530">The Larsen-C-Schelven is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula.</seg>
<seg id="1531">"North of this horseshoe, the balance of waxes and abrupt was disturbed several years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1532">"a complete Schelhagus is broken there, writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen."</seg>
<seg id="1533">"there is a lot to say that the Larsen-C Schelven is in danger, because the front edge has never gone as far as it is currently."</seg>
<seg id="1534">"in addition, the ice sheet stands under tension and can be disintegrated if a key point breaks down a piece."</seg>
<seg id="1535">Melting of Schelven and Eisberg does not increase the sea level as they float on the water and ice as much water as after the melting itself.</seg>
<seg id="1536">"however, the loss of the Schelhagus leads to the fact that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and can flow far more quickly than before."</seg>
<seg id="1537">"this could possibly increase sea level, but only to a small degree, writes the British research project on the observation of Antarctica (Midas)."</seg>
<seg id="1538">"according to AWI statements, the Larsen-C-Schelhagus is the fourth largest shrine of the Antarctic with almost 50,000 square kilometres."</seg>
<seg id="1539">"at the crossing from the mainland, it is up to 700 meters thick, at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters."</seg>
<seg id="1540">There it breaks down regularly.</seg>
<seg id="1541">"although it is a natural happening and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change, the iron sign now comes into a more dangerous position," said Martin O'Leary of British Swansea University. "</seg>
<seg id="1542">"this is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records," "he also confirmed."</seg>
<seg id="1543">"among scientists was controversial whether the Larsen-C Schelhagus should grow back or go back in the long term and possibly collapses, said his colleague Adrian Luckman and added:" our models say that it will be less stable. "</seg>
<seg id="1544">But this development will last for decades.</seg>
<seg id="1545">"even if these researchers do not bring back this gigantic iceberg back to climate change, many glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart over the past few decades."</seg>
<seg id="1546">This long skirt of the Antarctic stretches towards South America.</seg>
<seg id="1547">"according to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey, the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950s."</seg>
<seg id="1548">The drop in temperature has contributed to the decline.</seg>
<seg id="1549">"the Antarctic Peninsula has been warmed by around three degrees in the last 50 years, making it one of the areas where the temperature is the fastest."</seg>
<seg id="1550">CDU wants Haustarif at the staff</seg>
<seg id="1551">"because it becomes increasingly difficult to occupy vacant positions, the CDU demands to resign from the employer's association in order to become more attractive."</seg>
<seg id="1552">"only a few minutes before the summer break, the Kreitag has drowned 41 new jobs in administration."</seg>

<seg id="1556">Some 620 applications were to be recorded for the places to be awarded this year.</seg>
<seg id="1557">"nevertheless, the circle is still missing personnel to cope with the increased demands and tasks."</seg>
<seg id="1558">"currently, there are 50 non-occupied places in the district of Mettmann."</seg>
<seg id="1559">"among other things, we are looking for doctors and engineers as well as the forces of the general administration."</seg>
<seg id="1560">The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG and oppose the shortage of skilled workers in the administration.</seg>
<seg id="1561">"according to the wishes of the parties, the administration will develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development."</seg>
<seg id="1562">"the aim is not only to cover short-term needs for skilled workers, but to counteract the future-oriented application shortages."</seg>
<seg id="1563">"the overall concept should orient itself internally and externally, show concrete measures for cross-entrants and include an education offensive, call on CDU, FDP and UWG."</seg>
<seg id="1564">This sounds like a good approach.</seg>
<seg id="1565">Because the circle has it to do with personal problems that you didn't know before.</seg>
<seg id="1566">Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions.</seg>
<seg id="1567">"the speech is of a real" "competition of public employers." ""</seg>
<seg id="1568">"in addition, there is a high number of employees who excrete disease or age caused by the service."</seg>
<seg id="1569">"high time for action, so that not even more jobs remain unoccupied."</seg>
<seg id="1570">"but Klaus-Dieter Krieg, president of the CDU, goes beyond the joint application with his party."</seg>
<seg id="1571">He already caused a bad surprise already in the circular day when he publicly challenged the personnel costs and baffled the rest of the parties.</seg>
<seg id="1572">"" "people want all possibilities to be verified which allow a withdrawal from the communal employers' association."</seg>
<seg id="1573">"if we do not come to a satisfactory solution at short notice, the district administration with the trade unions - perhaps in cooperation with the county-affiliated towns - should aim for a" Haustarif, "so peoples."</seg>
<seg id="1574">"in this way, the CDU tries to pay better the employees and officials than it actually envisages the tariff for the public service."</seg>
<seg id="1575">"the salaries are currently precisely prescribed, increases or more money is only available if you change to a higher level, which is oriented towards professional years."</seg>
<seg id="1576">But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years.</seg>
<seg id="1577">"only a few weeks ago, new premises had to be established in which employees take care of the provisions of the new Prostitution Act."</seg>

<seg id="1582">"Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat of the German relief organisation 'Youth Rettet', because their team effectively collaborated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration."</seg>
<seg id="1583">"the relief organisation, which has been in operation since one year, refused to express himself to detailed allegations by the Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio."</seg>
<seg id="1584">"we are sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment," the organisation said in an opinion on the social media. "</seg>
<seg id="1585">"we can assess all allegations that are currently being raised, after we have collected all the information and assess the situation."</seg>
<seg id="1586">"the Italian authorities had supervised the boat of 'Youth Rettet', the Iuventa, since October."</seg>
<seg id="1587">"it is thought that its crew takes dinghy migrants aboard, which can be delivered directly by traffickers, and that the smugglers can go off so that the ships can be used again."</seg>
<seg id="1588">"at least one such meeting took place at least 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast, according to the prosecutor's act, whose content was published by Italian media."</seg>
<seg id="1589">"the crew is suspected of overseeing the authority of the Italian Coast Guard, the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not from any other motives."</seg>
<seg id="1590">"under the Code of Conduct, boats such as Iuventa must have an Italian police officer monitoring their activities."</seg>
<seg id="1591">"only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to keep the code: save the Children, Moas from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain."</seg>
<seg id="1592">"the latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable, as they would not bring" substantial changes or obstructions "of their rescue operations."</seg>
<seg id="1593">Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize laureate organization Doctors Without Borders (MSF).</seg>
<seg id="1594">"Minniti has now said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy after the rescue operations in Italy has declined sharply in recent weeks, suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguards and co-operation with local mayors have borne fruit."</seg>
<seg id="1595">"in the last days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel," "said the minister."</seg>
<seg id="1596">"he announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad, Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries hoping to reach Europe."</seg>
<seg id="1597">Ascents and Trials</seg>
<seg id="1598">"nine Weilermer Bikers, the" Berlin Outpost "and two guest drivers met at Wachenheim in the North Palatinate, to enjoy Trieste and sights for four days."</seg>
<seg id="1599">There were three friendly guides available for this purpose.</seg>
<seg id="1600">The accommodation in the Wachenheimer valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours.</seg>
<seg id="1601">The Burgundy and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra.</seg>
<seg id="1602">The first tour led to hot summer temperatures along the vineyards to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim.</seg>
<seg id="1603">"there were viewpoints, partly on towers, from which one could look far over the Pfälzer forest and the upstream levels."</seg>
<seg id="1604">"in between, there were again and again longer ascents, for the long trials poppy."</seg>
<seg id="1605">On the second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the folk festival sausage market.</seg>
<seg id="1606">"once again a belvedere ascended to the viewpoint, connected by" "flowige" "trials and moderate ascents."</seg>
<seg id="1607">On the last two days there were again a lot of altimeters.</seg>
<seg id="1608">"caves, rocks, towers, castles, ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks."</seg>
<seg id="1609">"in Bad Dürkheim, the bikers inhaled healing brine in the open-air inhalatorium."</seg>
<seg id="1610">Neustadt was controlled too.</seg>
<seg id="1611">"after 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres altitude, the group met the Pfälzer Wald from its best side - sporty and cultural."</seg>
<seg id="1612">Console instead of grass - Bundesliga upgrads for e-sport</seg>
<seg id="1613">Do the sports stars sit in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium race against wind and weather?</seg>
<seg id="1614">"fact: e-sport has long become a serious industry, become a lucrative business - big stars, millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gauges included."</seg>
<seg id="1615">"this has also recognized the first federal ligades, which are increasingly involved in this field."</seg>
<seg id="1616">"the beginning of 2015 was the VfL Wolfsburg, later the FC Schalke 04 and last of the VfB Stuttgart, who founded an e-sport division in the middle of July, and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 under contract."</seg>
<seg id="1617">"we hope to inspire very new young target groups for the VfB," says CEO Jochen Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1618">He is sure that there are still a number of clubs on this train.</seg>
<seg id="1619">"on the next weekend, FIFA World Cup in London organizes the first Interactive Club World Cup, in which the gamers of different clubs compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1620">"besides Schalke and Wolfsburg, for example, Manchester City, Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualify."</seg>
<seg id="1621">Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1622">The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen meanwhile advises an agency for virtual football players.</seg>
<seg id="1623">"the real football has to deal with the 14 to 30-year-olds, that the young people will go into the stadium also in the future," says the 52-year-old. "</seg>
<seg id="1624">"and: the clubs tried to conquer all kinds of markets, especially the Asian."</seg>
<seg id="1625">"with prominent e-sportsmen under the contract, one could be far more often present on these markets online than once a year to send the Federal Tax Treaty to Asia."</seg>
<seg id="1626">What is it all about?</seg>
<seg id="1627">"in e-sport, computer games such as League Of Legends," Dota 2, "" Counterstrike, "or the football simulation of FIFA are challenged on competition level."</seg>
<seg id="1628">"as in the normal sport, Lists have long since established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other."</seg>
<seg id="1629">"and in the Asian Games 2022, e-sport is already part of the official program."</seg>
<seg id="1630">But is it really a sport?</seg>
<seg id="1631">"for many, the idea is safe to use."</seg>
<seg id="1632">Ingo Froberie has long dealt with the question.</seg>
<seg id="1633">"e-sport is a sport for the professor at the German Sporthochschule in Cologne because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions which one can find in classical sports - such as increased heart rates, stress reactions, hormonal changes."</seg>
<seg id="1634">"in addition, cognitive skills, a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction ability."</seg>
<seg id="1635">Professional gamers should exercise not only on the console but also their body and pay attention to the nutrition.</seg>
<seg id="1636">"the fit player is a good player."</seg>
<seg id="1637">"however, Froberie also sees problems:" doping becomes more and more a topic. ""</seg>
<seg id="1638">"controls are difficult to perform in online games, and in the scene the structures of classic sports are missing."</seg>
<seg id="1639">"in a positive way, the scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of E-sport."</seg>
<seg id="1640">"players are on the move internationally, this is like a big global family, there are no intercultural obstacles."</seg>
<seg id="1641">A study of corporate consultancy Deloitte and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment software (BIU) predicts rapid growth in E-sport.</seg>
<seg id="1642">"in 2016, 50 million euros have been implemented in Germany, mainly via advertising, sponsoring and big tournaments."</seg>
<seg id="1643">"in three years, turnover is expected to be at 130 million."</seg>
<seg id="1644">"against the almost 2.4 billion euros of the Bundesliga, this is little."</seg>
<seg id="1645">"however, the e-sport is no longer far from other established sports such as handball, basketball or hockey," writes the Deloitte advisors. "</seg>
<seg id="1646">Many countries are already on the move.</seg>
<seg id="1647">"big markets are Asia and the USA, where ex-basketball player Shaquille O'Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez are participating in the US Team NRG eSports."</seg>
<seg id="1648">Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher is investing in the eSport competitions Unikrn.</seg>
<seg id="1649">"in Europe too, some things are happening."</seg>
<seg id="1650">"in a Norwegian school, e-sport was introduced as a classroom, says Froberie."</seg>
<seg id="1651">"in the Netherlands and France, the football first league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sport department."</seg>
<seg id="1652">"in the European comparison, Germany declines behind," explains VfB-Chairman Röttgermann. "</seg>
<seg id="1653">Only to fall into nostalgia and to clarify the old times is no longer enough today.</seg>
<seg id="1654">"the aim is to preserve the tradition of the association, but also to align the company with the modern market."</seg>
<seg id="1655">"we live in a digitized world," "says Dutt."</seg>
<seg id="1656">You can't keep in mind that everything stays as it always was with football.</seg>

<seg id="1661">Michelle Carter sentenced to suicide because of the texts Conrad Roy</seg>
<seg id="1662">A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her boyfriend through texts and calls to suicide.</seg>
<seg id="1663">"Michelle Carter, now 20, will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years have been exposed to parole."</seg>
<seg id="1664">Carter was convicted in June of Conrad Roy's negligent killing that took place on 13 July 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1665">The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing: "my family is uncomforting.</seg>
<seg id="1666">My son was my best friend. "</seg>
<seg id="1667">Carter was allowed to remain free until his appointment.</seg>
<seg id="1668">"she had been confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years, but her legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy had suffered from a mental illness."</seg>
<seg id="1669">"dressed in red trousers and a cream colored blouse, Carter stood there with tears in her eyes, with folded hands and eyes directed downwards when she was convicted."</seg>
<seg id="1670">"their actions have killed Conrad Roy," "said the prosecutor to the court."</seg>
<seg id="1671">She finished his life to make her own better.</seg>
<seg id="1672">"she took no responsibility," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="1673">"she has shown no repentance."</seg>
<seg id="1674">But Carter's lawyer said it was a "awful circumstance that she fully regrets."</seg>
<seg id="1675">"judge Lawrence Moniz said, however, he did not find that their" age or maturity "or even their mental illness have a significant effect on their actions."</seg>
<seg id="1676">"a public prosecutor read a statement by Roys's mother Lynn Roy, saying that there is" no day in which I do not pray the loss of my beloved son. "</seg>
<seg id="1677">"I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything. I try to be there for his sisters, despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity." ""</seg>
<seg id="1678">"Roys's sister, Camdyn Roy, said she was" "persecuted" "by the recognition that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or would be an aunt for his children."</seg>
<seg id="1679">"no longer the only person I have been with since my birth every day is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life," she said. "</seg>
<seg id="1680">"the case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts, which makes it a crime to commit another to commit suicide."</seg>
<seg id="1681">Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014.</seg>
<seg id="1682">"the case drew attention to national attention, after Carter revealed text messages that she encouraged him to end his life."</seg>
<seg id="1683">"hang up, spring from a building, get yourself, I don't know, there are many ways," "she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death, while he was on vacation with his family."</seg>
<seg id="1684">"in the moments before his suicide she wrote:" you must do it, Conrad "and" Everything you have to do is turn off the generator and you'll be free and happy. "</seg>
<seg id="1685">Judge Moniz said Carter's attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered them to benefit from the event by some press.</seg>
<seg id="1686">The case has divided the legal opinion.</seg>
<seg id="1687">"among the few who defended Carter, Amanda Knox was a member of Amanda Knox who was convicted of murder at her UK resident in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago."</seg>
<seg id="1688">"Ms. Knox, 30 years old, published a comment in the Los Angeles Times:" Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help, not jail. "</seg>

<seg id="1690">That Joshua was allowed to run as captain for the Audi Cup at the Audi Cup is not a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="1691">The FC Bayern won a big season to the Confed Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt.</seg>

<seg id="1695">"good, the entrance could have been better than at 0: 2 against SSC Napoli."</seg>
<seg id="1696">But Kimi was able to interpret the sign of the coach.</seg>
<seg id="1697">"not the eight-year old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a guide in the C-Elf, who had been welcomed by youth players, debutants and just out of the holiday, but he."</seg>
<seg id="1698">"sugar is best distributed to those, to whom you want to eat much, which you want to keep in your mood."</seg>
<seg id="1699">"so who was chosen to take on the heritage of Lahm, can use a little extra motivation only well."</seg>
<seg id="1700">Kimmich confirmed: "that's what you want as a player: take responsibility.</seg>
<seg id="1701">"on Wednesday, the 22-year-old flattened as a mini-undertook over the field."</seg>
<seg id="1702">"right behind, this is now his position, the white bandage on the arm did her rest."</seg>
<seg id="1703">"and Kimi also worked in this initial formation, like the one who can take the rudder at the best."</seg>
<seg id="1704">"he gave instructions, tried to direct the unenacted troupe."</seg>
<seg id="1705">"he had a look at the whole, while many others were busy with himself."</seg>
<seg id="1706">"Vidal, trying to overplay his missing fitness (did not fold); Renato Sanches thus, on the devil come out of the performance of the Asia trip (also only limited); and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle, in their first appearance in the Bavaria Tricot, did not fall negative."</seg>
<seg id="1707">"after all, it worked very well."</seg>
<seg id="1708">"Süle ran beside Kimme, Rudy before the defense, both were acting confidently."</seg>
<seg id="1709">"the well-known Napoli-storm was often difficult, and Süle also tried a few times in the build-up."</seg>
<seg id="1710">"his colleague Rudy admitted that the result was" "not as we had hoped for." ""</seg>

<seg id="1712">"game relocation, tempo change:" I was also brought up for this style. "</seg>
<seg id="1713">"as usual, this Bayern-World is still for the newcomers, one looked after the game."</seg>
<seg id="1714">"for example, Rudy did not have one or two in the catacombs, but determined six or seven interviews."</seg>
<seg id="1715">Kimi said goodbye after a few cracking sayings in the back of his new fellow players.</seg>
<seg id="1716">"there he heard an interesting sentence from Süle:" "what's going on here, I already noticed."</seg>

<seg id="1726">"it was often irreconcilable, the relationship between the country and the regional economy, when Eveline Lemke (Green) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate."</seg>
<seg id="1727">This is reflected in more than a year in which the new Minister of Economy Volker Wisser (FDP) is in office.</seg>
<seg id="1728">Chambers and companies from the region speak on T V demand from a change in economic policy - and at the same time blame the old minister.</seg>
<seg id="1729">"Frank natus, Chairman of the Association of Trierer Enterprises (VTU), says:" "Wisser picks up the wishes of the economy, which blocked Lemke all together."</seg>
<seg id="1730">The largest turnaround sees natus in the infrastructure policy: the gap between the highway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country's priority list.</seg>
<seg id="1731">"this year, the Ministry hopes for a planning process until 2021 is expected to be building law."</seg>
<seg id="1732">"a role in the plans of the country also plays the western circumstance of Trier, which is in the urgent need of the Federal Highway Plan."</seg>
<seg id="1733">"the goal is to take the course into operation in December 2020, says Ministeriesspokesperson Cornelia Holtmann."</seg>
<seg id="1734">"natus sees this as a sign to support regional, but internationally competitive companies."</seg>
<seg id="1735">"the Chamber of Industry and Commerce (IHK) Trier is seeking, as by Wisser, an Rheinland-Pfalz-label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of the German wine exports declining for ten years."</seg>
<seg id="1736">"in addition, Wisser has an open ear for people who want to establish their own company, the Chamber of Commerce commends."</seg>
<seg id="1737">"the Chamber of Crafts of Trier sees in the new Master Bonus an additional incentive for young trainees, says managing director Matthias Schwalbach."</seg>
<seg id="1738">A premium of 1000 Euro is planned for the passed master examination and 2500 euros if graduates within ten years after the master's education become self-sufficient.</seg>
<seg id="1739">The homework list for the country remains long.</seg>
<seg id="1740">"the planned road building will quickly provide facts, but at the same time it fails the country of the necessary personnel," says Jan Glockauer, CEO of the IHK Trier. "</seg>
<seg id="1741">"of 56 new engineers, who wants to hire Wisser in the country's mobility, only 29 positions have been occupied so far."</seg>

<seg id="1743">"CDU spokesperson on CDU, Christian Baldauf, refers to the calculations of the Court of Auditors, the country will invest more than 20 million euros less in the maintenance of regional roads in 2017 and 2018."</seg>
<seg id="1744">Frank natus also expects a concept of the country to address the shortage of skilled workers in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1745">"in addition, the former broadband construction in the country is also sobering."</seg>

<seg id="1752">"the BMW Group said that the company believes that" there are smarter options than driving restrictions, "and thus moved to European cities - including Munich, where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles."</seg>
<seg id="1753">Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1754">None of the companies described the undertakings as a recall.</seg>
<seg id="1755">European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules for carbon dioxide emissions.</seg>
<seg id="1756">"nitrogen oxides, emitting diesel engines, are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma."</seg>
<seg id="1757">"the cost of automakers to install exhaust fumes from diesel vehicles is also increasing, which makes it difficult to keep the price of the cars competitive."</seg>
<seg id="1758">German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of seizing the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem.</seg>
<seg id="1759">"the companies are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen, which could regulate the use of so-called switch-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested, but in normal driving conditions."</seg>
<seg id="1760">"in the United States, several Volkswagen employees were indicted; others were examined on both sides of the Atlantic."</seg>
<seg id="1761">"last month, the former director of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="1762">"the former manager, Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio, is an Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1763">"at the beginning of this year, Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen, after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emissions regulations in Europe, and a request focused on the United States was expanded."</seg>

<seg id="1796">"it has become a symbol of Provence in the South of France, but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change."</seg>
<seg id="1797">"the lavender is declining because of drought-reminding conditions and insect-borne insects, causing great headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions."</seg>
<seg id="1798">"Eric Chaisse, expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence, said:" "the lavender in Provence is effectively endangered because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change over the past few years and much more in the spring."</seg>
<seg id="1799">This has effects on the lifespan of lavender.</seg>
<seg id="1800">"there is also a small Zikade, a microbacterium that transfers the dwarf cicadas, and in very dry weather there are many of them."</seg>
<seg id="1801">And there is much on the game.</seg>
<seg id="1802">Lavender oil attracts not only holidaymakers but also for perfumes and cosmetics.</seg>
<seg id="1803">"Eric Chaisse said:" "instead of having very long plants with a large number of flowers, we have smaller, underdeveloped and either missing or weakened."</seg>

<seg id="1809">The assassination of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico</seg>
<seg id="1810">"the staff of the weekly Riodoce usually meet Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime, corrupt officials and unceasing drugs wars."</seg>
<seg id="1811">"but on that day, in the shadow of their own tragedy, they came together to talk about security."</seg>
<seg id="1812">They were told that it is important to change their routines.</seg>
<seg id="1813">"two high-ranking journalists are discussing what feels more secure: they should take their children into the office, who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009, or leave them at home."</seg>
<seg id="1814">"security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room: opponents, neutrals, allies."</seg>
<seg id="1815">"they ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed, perceptions and abdominal feelings are enough."</seg>
<seg id="1816">"there are drug smugglers, politicians, businessmen, journalists suspected of standing on the government's payroll list or cartels, a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous."</seg>
<seg id="1817">"there is no rest from the violence, and while the corpses are piling up throughout the country, more and more journalists are there: at least 25, since President Enrique Pena Nieto began his office in December 2012. 589 are after attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven dead in seven countries this year."</seg>
<seg id="1818">"among the latter, her editor and inspirer of Riodoce, co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas."</seg>
<seg id="1819">"the biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist," "wrote Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1820">"two reporters in the 1930's, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez, wearing t-shirts, which show his smiling face with glasses or his typical Panamahut."</seg>
<seg id="1821">"the workshop takes place less than two months after his death, and the reporters discuss their shared themes, the trauma, their nightmares, sleeplessness, paranoia."</seg>
<seg id="1822">"although a Sonder-Attorney General was built in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists, the Committee on the Protection of Journalists has only initiated two criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="1823">"as with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year, the murderers of journalists are rarely brought to trial."</seg>
<seg id="1824">"in Riodoce they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa, although they are inconsolable and although the terrain is now more treacherous."</seg>
<seg id="1825">"without information about the murderers, without justice, the meeting to discuss security has little benefit, says Ibarra."</seg>
<seg id="1826">"it is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="1827">"as long as we don't know the why, we distrust all."</seg>
<seg id="1828">"in the morning of May 15, Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan."</seg>
<seg id="1829">"he managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men. he was forced out of his car and was shot on him 12 times, probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with" twelve river. ""</seg>
<seg id="1830">The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby.</seg>
<seg id="1831">Valdez was 50 years old.</seg>
<seg id="1832">He left a wife and two adult children.</seg>
<seg id="1833">Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1834">But on the subject of Valdez there is practically nothing but silence.</seg>
<seg id="1835">"since Guzman's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January, Sinaloa had become one of the bloodiest battlefields of the country, as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum."</seg>
<seg id="1836">"it doesn't matter that in Sinaloa someone or more people are shot on the street every day, or that the cemetery is full of ornate, two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many homes for the living."</seg>
<seg id="1837">"forget for a minute that there is a state of" tranquility, "if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States."</seg>
<seg id="1838">"despite the fact that Valdez had become aware of the dangers of his work, Ismail Bojorquez (60), a co-founder and director of Riodoce, broke away with the guilt that he could not protect his friend."</seg>
<seg id="1839">He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder.</seg>
<seg id="1840">"first, in February, the publication of an interview with Damascenes Lopez, a leader of one of the rivaling cartel fractions in war with Guzman's sons."</seg>
<seg id="1841">"this publication may have annoyed the sons, they presumed gangmembers bought each copy of the issue, as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks."</seg>
<seg id="1842">"the second mistake was not to compel Valdez after the confiscation of another newspaper, which had published the same story, to leave the country on its own security."</seg>
<seg id="1843">Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad and its killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists.</seg>
<seg id="1844">He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues felt that he would always be there.</seg>
<seg id="1845">He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars.</seg>
<seg id="1846">"in Sinaloa," it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug addict, "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1847">"with time, the newspaper gained a reputation for bold and honest reporting, and sales and advertising increased."</seg>
<seg id="1848">Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-fitting investigations without fear of censorship and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat.</seg>
<seg id="1849">"eight years after the establishment of Riodoce, she received the prestigious" Maria Moors Cabot Award "for her coverage in Latin America."</seg>
<seg id="1850">"in the same year, Valdez won the 'International Press Freedom Award' of the Committee on the protection of journalists for his courage to prosecute the Mexican drug history, wherever it led."</seg>
<seg id="1851">He volunteered to be afraid.</seg>
<seg id="1852">"I would like to continue living," he said at the time of the CPJ Award. "</seg>
<seg id="1853">"drug trafficking in Sinaloa" is a way of life, "he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento-TV."</seg>
<seg id="1854">You have to take over the task which you will notice as a journalist - either that or you play the dummy.</seg>
<seg id="1855">I don't want to be asked: "what have you done in the face of so many dead... why did you not say what was going on?</seg>
<seg id="1856">"the Riodoce team misses Valdez, the fun bird, who was able to curse like a dockworker, a friend who generously embraced hugs and counsels, a teacher who knew how to survive."</seg>
<seg id="1857">They trusted in his routine.</seg>
<seg id="1858">He would always wear his hat.</seg>
<seg id="1859">"he would always go to El Guayabo, the bar opposite the office, and always sit at the same table."</seg>
<seg id="1860">"then ask them," "Was his love to the routine his destruction?" ""</seg>
<seg id="1861">"his death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work, and stay alive."</seg>
<seg id="1862">"they don't like it when you deal with their wives, their children, their clean stores, their home starting and landing ways" "to move drugs."</seg>
<seg id="1863">"these things were not allowed," "said Bojorquez."</seg>
<seg id="1864">"the result is, even in the best times, a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation."</seg>
<seg id="1865">Trust his own instincts.</seg>
<seg id="1866">"if it smells wrong, stay away from it."</seg>
<seg id="1867">"anger is, the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that" smell is a sense that can be deceived... and then the thing happened with Javier. "</seg>
<seg id="1868">"the old rules, as he and others say, are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just like in Tamaulipas, Veracruz, Guerrero, and other states in which a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling, weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home."</seg>
<seg id="1869">The landscape is changing constantly.</seg>
<seg id="1870">"in the room where the staff of Riodoce met for safety training, suddenly no cell phones were allowed. days before it was known that Spyware, which was sold exclusively to governments, was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico."</seg>
<seg id="1871">Outside two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees (40 ° C) in the shadow of a tree.</seg>
<seg id="1872">They were commissioned by the provincial government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle-class neighborhood of Culiacan.</seg>
<seg id="1873">"half in the joke, some of the reporters questioned whether these officers belong to the 50 per cent of the policemen who referred to the governor himself as not trustworthy."</seg>
<seg id="1874">"it has been months since the reporters went to the mountain scenery, where the drug gangs are de facto control."</seg>
<seg id="1875">For the issue of this week Riodoce has fucked on three main stories.</seg>
<seg id="1876">There was the assassination of brother of the former famous julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa.</seg>
<seg id="1877">They also had an exposé to the state expenditures focused on the Governor's hometown.</seg>
<seg id="1878">"and there was a group in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan, a block from the Office of the Public Prosecutor, conducted a kidnapping."</seg>
<seg id="1879">"there was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened, so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows that the restaurant is a favorite local of drug dealers and authorities."</seg>
<seg id="1880">"a reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician, who belonged to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party (PRI) which ruled all the political levels almost the whole century."</seg>
<seg id="1881">"recently, several PRI governors were accused of corruption in high-caliber cases."</seg>
<seg id="1882">"Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this pub, including one in which a son of" El Chapo "Guzman escaped a military attack."</seg>
<seg id="1883">"only a few months earlier, readers would have considered the column of Valdez as the most informed source about the abduction."</seg>
<seg id="1884">"previously we would have known what happened," "said Villarreal, 46, with the nickname" "El Flaco" "because of its slim body stature."</seg>
<seg id="1885">"now, all channels of communication with our sources are broken."</seg>
<seg id="1886">"Valdez's office was dedicated to the storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists, because the employees have become something they never expected: activists in the name of the press."</seg>
<seg id="1887">Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist at the office of the Public Prosecutor.</seg>
<seg id="1888">"Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed, in the western state of Michoacan."</seg>
<seg id="1889">"a burnt body has been discovered and officials say, based on DNA tests that it is."</seg>
<seg id="1890">"in the whole country, journalists have become louder by written in organized protests" SOS Press "on walkways and buildings."</seg>
<seg id="1891">"on that day, director Bojorquez is in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case."</seg>
<seg id="1892">"at a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez, Ramirez accused the authorities of picking up journalists and letting them move because they told the truth."</seg>
<seg id="1893">"she has since then asked that she is reorganized by the government, because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity."</seg>
<seg id="1894">"Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime, government officials and a valid society."</seg>
<seg id="1895">"in his last book" Narco-Journalism, "he wrote that reporters were not only killed by drug gangs, but also on orders from politicians and security forces, who were infected with organised crime under a blanket."</seg>
<seg id="1896">"last year, the media group" Articulo 19 "assigned more than half of the attacks to journalists by the police and officials."</seg>
<seg id="1897">"in Mexico you die because they want you to keep your mouth," "said Ramirez."</seg>
<seg id="1898">"obviously, the killings have a deterrent effect."</seg>
<seg id="1899">No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1900">Her body was found along with a note that was supposed to be signed by the Zetas Kartell: "here I am because of my reports.</seg>
<seg id="1901">A computer keyboard and headphones are located next to their separate head.</seg>
<seg id="1902">Some branches have chosen to close like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state Chihuahua after the assassination of correspondent Miroslav Breach in March.</seg>
<seg id="1903">Others continue as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of its director in 2004.</seg>
<seg id="1904">"in 2010, the Diario de Ciudad Juarez directed publicly to the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the title" What do you want of us? ""</seg>
<seg id="1905">Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country.</seg>
<seg id="1906">It is a painful decision.</seg>
<seg id="1907">"it is hard to find work in exile, and they still watch the streets and search for dangers."</seg>
<seg id="1908">"and sometimes they are hunted, as evidently the photographer Ruben Espinosa, who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz."</seg>
<seg id="1909">"for those who remain behind and continue the work, it is a daily dance with risky decisions."</seg>
<seg id="1910">"Ibarra, who once wanted to be a poet, admits that drug trafficking was frightened."</seg>
<seg id="1911">"Mexico goes to hell, and so I became reporter," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="1912">"at midnight on the last Friday, when the last issue had already ended, the editors of Riodoce sat on the sidewalk in front of the office and drank beer, when all their phones began to sum up."</seg>
<seg id="1913">A number of shooting companies with belt rivalities and security forces near the seaside resort Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead.</seg>
<seg id="1914">The war escalated as promised by a series of Kartell messages in the region.</seg>
<seg id="1915">"from the curb edge, they released the news on the website of Riodoce on mobile phone."</seg>
<seg id="1916">The title page had to be changed the next day.</seg>
<seg id="1917">Sirens stayed nearby - another shooting in the area.</seg>
<seg id="1918">Bojorquez threw a look at the police officers who kept watch to see if they were ready.</seg>
<seg id="1919">"if they were afraid at all, they didn't show it."</seg>
<seg id="1920">"under the huge portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper, whose middle finger was visible to all of Sinaloa, the staff of Riodoce followed his tracks."</seg>
<seg id="1921">"how can you only think of closing it," said Bojorquez, "if on the same day, where Javier was murdered, the interns asked me to send them to the road."</seg>
<seg id="1922">Dinosaurs used camouflage to evade his enemies</seg>
<seg id="1923">"at first glance, it looks like a statue, albeit a frightening."</seg>
<seg id="1924">Researchers have now discovered that the first findings of the incredible rashorns of a Canadian miners have been so well received that experts described it as "Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1925">"it was so well received that they could even find out that his scaly skin was of reddish brown, and they said she had something of a" "troubled past". ""</seg>
<seg id="1926">"the report in the journal" Current Biology "described it as" the best-preserved dinosaur, ever found, and one of the best dinosaurs in the world. "</seg>
<seg id="1927">The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaurier which lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago.</seg>
<seg id="1928">"his amazingly well-preserved condition has startled researchers, who describe it as" truly remarkable. ""</seg>
<seg id="1929">"according to reports in National Geographic, the armored herbivorous is the best preserved fossil of its kind."</seg>
<seg id="1930">"Shawn Funk found it in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada."</seg>
<seg id="1931">"he met something out of the surrounding rock, and decided to look more closely."</seg>
<seg id="1932">The fossils discovered by him were sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology.</seg>
<seg id="1933">"during the next six years, they spent the next six years revealing the wild beast within the 2,500 pounds (1,100 kg) of crude oil."</seg>
<seg id="1934">"after all this hard work, the finished result is now ready to be revealed."</seg>
<seg id="1935">"if you only blinking a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that it was sleeping," "said the main author Caleb Brown, scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum, where the creature is to be seen."</seg>
<seg id="1936">It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs.</seg>
<seg id="1937">"researchers have found that this herbivorous, even though it is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank, probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1938">"the heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators, and used a shielding technique known as counter-protection, which is also used by many modern animals."</seg>
<seg id="1939">"this would have allowed it to better blend in its surroundings and to evade its enemies, experts say that it was threatened by major dinosaurs."</seg>
<seg id="1940">The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May and is now exhibited at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology.</seg>
<seg id="1941">"researchers have now studied the wild animal and named it Borealopelta markmitchelli according to the Museum technician Mark Mitchell, one of a team that has spent more than 7.000 hours to uncover it carefully."</seg>
<seg id="1942">The amazing conservation of the specimen allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of sheds and armor over his body.</seg>
<seg id="1943">"they discovered the counter-shading, a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom, which means that the head of the creature was darker than its underside."</seg>
<seg id="1944">"although the counter-shading is common, the results are surprising since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today living animals."</seg>
<seg id="1945">It suggests that the dinosaurs were driven by enough pressure by carnivorous dinosaurs that evolution favored the concealment of confrontation as a means of survival.</seg>
<seg id="1946">"but most contemporary animals that use the counter-shade - think of deer, zebras or armadillos - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot, which signals that this Nodosaurier was exposed to a real fight for survival."</seg>
<seg id="1947">"strong predator behavior on a massive, heavily armoured dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaurs of the Cretaceous period must have been," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1948">The chemical analysis of organic compounds in her scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was bay.</seg>
<seg id="1949">"scientists continue to examine the animal on clues about his life, including its conserved bowel content, to find out what it has eaten as his last meal."</seg>
<seg id="1950">"they believe that the dinosaur, when he died, got into a river and was driven out into the sea, where he sank on the back to the bottom of the sea."</seg>
<seg id="1951">"at that time, Alberta was as warm as South Florida today, and rivers and oceans are probably much more widespread than they are today."</seg>
<seg id="1952">"this Nodosaurier is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with preserved scaly skin, but remains preserved in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal," Brown said. "</seg>
<seg id="1953">The result is that today the animal looks almost exactly the same as in the early chalk time.</seg>
<seg id="1954">"you don't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it. if you just shoot a little with your eyes, you could almost believe that he is asleep."</seg>
<seg id="1955">"the Cretaceous Age was a time when huge theropods, carnivorous dinosaurs, who stood on two legs, went through the earth."</seg>
<seg id="1956">"although the king of them, the Tyrannosaurus Rex, lived millions of years after Borealopelta, the armoured dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors."</seg>
<seg id="1957">"this includes the Acrocanthosaurus, a 38 foot (11,5 m) long, six tons of heavy monsters."</seg>
<seg id="1958">"the scientists, whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology, believe that Borealopelta sank after death in the sea and was mumified in mud."</seg>
<seg id="1959">"the creature was found by Shawn Funk, when he was buried in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta, Canada, on 21 March 2011."</seg>
<seg id="1960">"according to the museum, it is the best-preserved dinosaur of the world, including skin and armor, and is completely from the muzzle to the hip."</seg>
<seg id="1961">"the creatures were average about 18 feet (5 meters) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds (1,300 kg)."</seg>
<seg id="1962">It contained two 20-inch long spikes which raged from his shoulders.</seg>
<seg id="1963">The researchers believe that the armored herbivores were swamped by Western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea.</seg>
<seg id="1964">But the underwater crew of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail.</seg>
<seg id="1965">The fossilized remains of this special specimen are so well preserved that the Hautreste still cover hollowed armored armored plateplates along the dinosaur</seg>
<seg id="1966">"as Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic, such a level of preservation is as' rare as a win in the lottery."</seg>
<seg id="1967">"the more I consider it, the more confusing it becomes."</seg>
<seg id="1968">Petrified remains of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that carry the skull of the animal.</seg>
<seg id="1969">"his right forefoot is on his side, his five fingers are spread upward."</seg>
<seg id="1970">I can count the scales on his sole.</seg>

<seg id="1999">"in order to be able to use them, however, some requirements have to be fulfilled: you need a smartphone or tablet."</seg>
<seg id="2000">And you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway.</seg>
<seg id="2001">"it also has to be purchased via the app of the train, the DB Navigator, which is anyway the most convenient way of booking a ticket."</seg>

<seg id="2023">"the police had just killed a 18-year-old child, and it still lies on the road," "said it there."</seg>
<seg id="2024">"confused, since nobody else posted the information on her feed, she closed Facebook and opened Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="2025">A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly rescued on their timeline.</seg>
<seg id="2026">"the rapper from the area of St. Louis was to tweets the death of Michael Brown, an unarmed black 18-year-old, who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson, Mo."</seg>
<seg id="2027">He posted an image of Brown's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there for four hours.</seg>
<seg id="2028">"that's wild," Ferrell thought. "</seg>
<seg id="2029">But death was nothing new for them and their community.</seg>
<seg id="2030">She left her cell phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield-Drive later in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="2031">"there were photos of police tape and people crying out, and a man who claimed to be a father's father who wore a sign with the inscription:" Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son! "</seg>
<seg id="2032">She watched a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of protesters with a barking dog.</seg>
<seg id="2033">"in another video she said, another policeman escaped his gun and cried," "I'm going to kill you... animals all kill."</seg>
<seg id="2034">"this is not usual," "said Ferrell to her statement."</seg>
<seg id="2035">This is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical.</seg>
<seg id="2036">At this moment I felt shivering.</seg>
<seg id="2037">I was angry and cried. "</seg>
<seg id="2038">She booked a return flight and went home the next day.</seg>
<seg id="2039">After the landing at 11 o'clock she took her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning.</seg>
<seg id="2040">"what happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson, is the theme of a new documentary film called" Whose Streets? "in the cinemas from the 11th century onwards."</seg>
<seg id="2041">"it is a story of survival and protest, love and loss, strength and resistance, which consist of the perspective of people who live in community and have filled the streets to demand answers."</seg>
<seg id="2042">"as Ferrell with her daughter, who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown, went to Ferguson, the two talked a conversation that they had countless times before this morning 'over the black experience and the black state."</seg>
<seg id="2043">"you remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe?" "she reminded her of what she said."</seg>
<seg id="2044">We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that wasn't right.</seg>
<seg id="2045">"I could not take her along," Ferrell said later. "</seg>
<seg id="2046">What has happened today is a climax of what happened in the past.</seg>
<seg id="2047">It must know it and see it and be raised in it.</seg>
<seg id="2048">"it must be well developed, not only activism and organization, but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution, and what we must do to free ourselves to free ourselves."</seg>
<seg id="2049">"even if I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally do not experience a blatant racism, she is no different from the next black women's child."</seg>
<seg id="2050">I feel I would be a bad service to keep them far away.</seg>
<seg id="2051">"the first stop when they arrived in Ferguson was located at the South Florissant Road, a place opposite the police authority which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson."</seg>
<seg id="2052">"there Ferrell and her daughter joined together with a local business owner, who made lunch."</seg>
<seg id="2053">They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators.</seg>
<seg id="2054">Slowly a new type of activism began to take shape for Ferrell's form.</seg>
<seg id="2055">"my activism was totally changed after 9 August," she said, and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities. "</seg>
<seg id="2056">"I had no experience in organising.</seg>
<seg id="2057">It is all come. "</seg>
<seg id="2058">"weeks later Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration, one of the co-directors of the film."</seg>
<seg id="2059">Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to "document" what happened.</seg>
<seg id="2060">"a question came about Ferrell:" "do you want to document or try to find a story you can use?"</seg>
<seg id="2061">"this skepticism was nourished by countless cases of people, often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience."</seg>
<seg id="2062">"as Folayan recently stated in an interview," "We had heard that people who were born and raised in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to do it differently."</seg>
<seg id="2063">"Folayan had already collaborated with the former co-director Damon Davis, an artist from the area known for his activism around Todestrakt inmates."</seg>
<seg id="2064">"his commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project, along with six other locals followed the team of" Whose Streets? "in the years after Browning's shooting."</seg>
<seg id="2065">"this documentary is not someone who speaks to us or talks to us. we're talking," "Davis said."</seg>
<seg id="2066">"that was the main thing for me, how these people are represented, for so I will be represented."</seg>
<seg id="2067">"the goal was not to focus on Ferrara's experience - to show that the movement" is not a messiah leader but a community that comes together, "Folayan said - it proved to be the most obvious participant in the film."</seg>
<seg id="2068">"as a result, documents from" Whose Streets? "are surprisingly personal aspects of Ferris's life, as they love and marry their wife."</seg>
<seg id="2069">"I felt like naked," said Ferrell, laughing when she saw the finished product for the first time. "</seg>
<seg id="2070">But I have understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people.</seg>
<seg id="2071">"in addition, Ferris's history repeats the role of black gay women in the wider Black-Lives Matter movement."</seg>
<seg id="2072">"two of the three founders of the movement, following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012, identified the film" "Blacklive Matter" "in social media, identifying themselves as gay."</seg>
<seg id="2073">"black, gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement altogether," "said Ferrell," "and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts."</seg>
<seg id="2074">"black, gay women must bear the main burden of everything."</seg>
<seg id="2075">Folayan agreed to note that "the movement is really held by black women and many black women.</seg>
<seg id="2076">"however, it insists that" this is not an affirmativer type of action, "in which Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film on account of her identity."</seg>
<seg id="2077">"she was the person who shook this energy," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="2078">"it is not a coincidence, although it was at the forefront because in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman there is so much on the game."</seg>
<seg id="2079">You can feel their energy through the screen. "</seg>
<seg id="2080">"in the meantime, the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared, but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="2081">Ferrell is on probation for 2 ½ years because of blocking a highway at a demonstration.</seg>
<seg id="2082">It describes the socio-political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home: "chaos."</seg>
<seg id="2083">Nevertheless she clings to a chant and she feels obliged to this memory since she went on the road three years ago in Ferguson.</seg>
<seg id="2084">It is our duty to fight for our freedom.</seg>
<seg id="2085">It is our duty to win.</seg>
<seg id="2086">We have to love and support one another.</seg>
<seg id="2087">We have nothing to lose - except our chains. "</seg>
<seg id="2088">From "Dream" to "megalomania": TV readers discuss about the bit gallery</seg>
<seg id="2089">"the bit gallery moves people, even though it has not been built for a long time."</seg>
<seg id="2090">"but the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian precinct, since the first presentation in 2009, divides people into proponents and opponents."</seg>
<seg id="2091">"cold, the subject hardly leaves one."</seg>
<seg id="2092">The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page "Volksfreund Bitburg."</seg>
<seg id="2093">"while the one to the bit gallery say," That would be a dream "(Anja Becker) or" That would be real class "(Nicole Schauste), comes from the other side:" doesn't need a person "(Siggi Betzen) or quite simply:" megalomania! "(Lars Scholz)."</seg>
<seg id="2094">"while the proponents build that a gallery attracts more customers into the city, of which the other businesses benefit, the opponents fear that then the pedestrian precinct is bleeding."</seg>
<seg id="2095">"in addition, the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farmer's market hall stands, in which 13 direct marketing offers its products."</seg>
<seg id="2096">At the beginning of the construction work will be finished.</seg>
<seg id="2097">"the Galerie-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - in addition to the Beda-Platz, with the possibility to sit outside."</seg>
<seg id="2098">Simone Zimmer: "we have been shopping in the farmer's market almost weekly for many years.</seg>
<seg id="2099">"mainly our eggs, but also the delicious cakes of the housewives, again and again very gladly."</seg>
<seg id="2100">Also the butcher's shop we discovered for us.</seg>
<seg id="2101">We would like to wish that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there is a chance to maintain this offer.</seg>
<seg id="2102">"in other cities, there is that too."</seg>
<seg id="2103">Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting. "</seg>
<seg id="2104">Gerd Densing: "whether direct marketing is moving in a market hall in the gallery comes to the amount of rent.</seg>
<seg id="2105">"but this should not be low in the new project." ""</seg>
<seg id="2106">"Eva Kilic:" "why shopping palaces in Bitburg?"</seg>
<seg id="2107">"whether it's clothing, shoes, drugstores or supermarkets: I think that's unnecessary."</seg>
<seg id="2108">There is enough of this in our city.</seg>
<seg id="2109">"you see, how many stores are empty here - some for months and years."</seg>
<seg id="2110">"but since there is not yet a regular weekly market, it is all the more important that at least the market hall remains."</seg>
<seg id="2111">"after all, the goods offered there are fresh, is mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap at the top."</seg>
<seg id="2112">"as you can see, shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies, because the rented equipment is often not portable for retailers."</seg>
<seg id="2113">"it is a shame, special businesss almost no longer exist and what is left of it will probably disappear."</seg>
<seg id="2114">Wolf Fandel: "a shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me.</seg>
<seg id="2115">And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg.</seg>
<seg id="2116">Above all: where should the farmer's market hall be used during the construction period?</seg>
<seg id="2117">The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long run when the bit gallery actually comes.</seg>
<seg id="2118">Or does the spectral bit gallery already manage to drive all shops out of Bitburg?</seg>
<seg id="2119">George Marquet: "it simply won't work.</seg>
<seg id="2120">"and a shopping center, which is empty, no one needs."</seg>
<seg id="2121">"in my opinion it would have been better to promote a real farmer's market, instead of this gallery."</seg>
<seg id="2122">"but for a farmer's market hall, thanks to the insanely many - as I find - senseless building projects in Bitburg are no longer a place."</seg>
<seg id="2123">"once the farmer's market hall is destroyed, a piece of culture will disappear again."</seg>
<seg id="2124">A suitable similarity: artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA</seg>
<seg id="2125">"in the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white, black and brown, which are almost inconspicuous - hanging on cables from the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="2126">The 30 portraits were created by Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tuppers and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning.</seg>
<seg id="2127">Manning sent excerpts from Fort Leavenworth prison where the former intelligence analyst banished a 35-year prison sentence after she publicly traded diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website.</seg>
<seg id="2128">"the new exhibition, opened on August 2, is called" "A Becoming resemblance". ""</seg>
<seg id="2129">"she is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg, whose discipline combined her expertise in technology, computer science and art, and Manning, a transgender woman and groundbreaking dissident whose conviction has been transformed by Barack Obama, when he had only three days in his office."</seg>
<seg id="2130">"Dewey-Hagborg has an algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created out of the 30 portraits, how someone could look with these genomic data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also for identity."</seg>
<seg id="2131">"Manning, who was born as Bradley Edward, but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since puberty, was sentenced to 20 charges in 2013, including six violations of the espionage law, computer fraud and theft."</seg>
<seg id="2132">"her image was suppressed by the prison, so much that there was only one photo - a grained black-white selfie in which Manning was obviously sitting on a driver's seat and wearing a platinum-blonde wig - with which she was associated."</seg>
<seg id="2133">"in 2015, Dewey-Hagborg came just about the great success of her 2012 project 'Stranger Visions'."</seg>
<seg id="2134">"in this, the artist produced portraits of forensic artefacts like cigarette butcher and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste in order to produce a picture of how these people could look."</seg>
<seg id="2135">That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine.</seg>
<seg id="2136">"they conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison, and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article," explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition. "</seg>
<seg id="2137">"and she was not able to attend this time and she could not be photographed, so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a portrait of a DNA."</seg>
<seg id="2138">"in the course of two years, the artist and her incarcerated Muse exchanged several letters."</seg>
<seg id="2139">"they even created a cartoon titled" "Suppressed Images" "illustrated by Shoili Kanungo, who foresaw a future where the president would transform Chelseas's judgment and would be able to see the exhibition personally."</seg>
<seg id="2140">"Obama was actually only a few days after the book was published, asking Manning's release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas, was a welcome kind of happy coincidence."</seg>
<seg id="2141">"there is also a bit deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition, as Donald Trump has a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new tweetable ways to keep the rigid divisions that he should rectify."</seg>
<seg id="2142">"when Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things, she said that" things happen for a certain reason. "</seg>
<seg id="2143">"in a artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery Manning demanded with her superlarge signature underneath (the" i "in her surname is equipped with a heart) an end to" automatic fragmentation, whose foundation was gender, race, sexuality and culture. "</seg>
<seg id="2144">"on the opposite wall its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written in pencil, a thousandth of Cs and Gs and As."</seg>
<seg id="2145">"Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters (or nucleotides after the highly developed scientific encyclopedia of the artist), how amazingly similar, at least in biological sense, we are all."</seg>
<seg id="2146">"what people will hopefully take with it is that our genome does not care who we are and how openly genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are," said Dewey-Hagborg, whose video works from 2007, Spurious Memories, also to be seen. "</seg>
<seg id="2147">"DNA data can tell so many different stories, so the 30 of these stories are."</seg>
<seg id="2148">"the last piece in the exhibition, which is stored in a separate room, is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel."</seg>
<seg id="2149">It shows Manning how it appears with a hands-free hands from the discipline of discipline of the United States such as King Kong.</seg>
<seg id="2150">"when they cold your speech, then they have won," "it says."</seg>
<seg id="2151">"so keep your mouth shut."</seg>
<seg id="2152">"it came directly from a letter she wrote to me," "said the artist, greeting from Philadelphia."</seg>
<seg id="2153">I still get goosebumps when I talk about it.</seg>
<seg id="2154">"Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but when it was supposed to do it, it will be greeted in the middle of the room by the masks, from their own genomic simulations, which rally like hordes of protesters."</seg>
<seg id="2155">"this was also targeted like everything in the exhibition, up to the size (5" 2, Mannings Statur), in which their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil. "</seg>
<seg id="2156">"in the past I had them on the wall, but I wanted them to feel like a crowd," said Dewey-Hagborg by the portraits. "</seg>
<seg id="2157">"I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea, like the movement that was also stuck behind its liberation."</seg>
<seg id="2158">Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of Oxford University because of killing</seg>
<seg id="2159">"a nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford, who will be looked for as suspects after a man was stabbed in a luxurious flat in Chicago with fatal injuries."</seg>
<seg id="2160">"on Monday, Wyndham Lathem( 42) and Andrew Warren (56) issued warrants for murder because of murder due to their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau, as the acts of the National Court of Cook County show."</seg>
<seg id="2161">"the documents say that Cornell-Duranleau, 26, died after several stitches."</seg>
<seg id="2162">A joint warning system published by the Chicago Police Office states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July.</seg>

<seg id="2186">"everything was announced, everything is implemented."</seg>
<seg id="2187">"the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee (IOC) and WADA in the near future," he added. "</seg>
<seg id="2188">"however, one of the criteria listed in the list shows that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren about publicly funded doping in Russian sports."</seg>
<seg id="2189">"in terms of the matter, Mutko said:" "we carry out the investigation, because our anti-doping system has made a mistake."</seg>
<seg id="2190">All measures have been implemented.</seg>
<seg id="2191">"but there were no government programmes, and we will not admit that which does not exist."</seg>

<seg id="2193">"in conversation with the Russian sales agency rsport at the start of the day Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organizations, but added:" we have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations. "</seg>

<seg id="2210">"by creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement, it enables companies to conduct surveys, provide special groups and demographic groups, to offer employees anonymity and grievance hotlines, and in some cases allow whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite managers and contact the Board of Directors."</seg>

<seg id="2265">"the NCAA eliminated two-day exercises to facilitate the load of the players, and it actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="2266">"therefore, the first three sessions of the UCLA should start at 19: 15 in order to meet the already packed schedule of the players."</seg>
<seg id="2267">The compromise between the two days is more than a day when the Brotherhood postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras conducted practical exercises in Westwood for the first time.</seg>

<seg id="2291">"in his recent past, the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 and 1980's."</seg>
<seg id="2292">"but Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat at the Mainl River Valley in Kent and is now an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes, a mophaired Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents."</seg>
<seg id="2293">"I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years," he says melancholy. "</seg>
<seg id="2294">What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand.</seg>
<seg id="2295">"a Castle in England takes the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney. each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Steiewicz, Briony May Smith, William Exley, Becky Palmer and Isabel Greenberg."</seg>
<seg id="2296">"it is not the first book of Rhodes, which is based on an archive: he wrote 'Dead Men's Teeth and Other Stories' in 2014, a collection that was inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional."</seg>
<seg id="2297">"I have responded only to the thumb print on the page of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700's, who worked for the Jacobins," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="2298">"" "this is his thumb print!"</seg>
<seg id="2299">"and letters always smell of smoke, for at that time a fire was kindled because of the light."</seg>
<seg id="2300">"for someone who lives 300 years later, the smell has an effect as if it were also there."</seg>
<seg id="2301">"Oh, I love archives!"</seg>
<seg id="2302">"for someone who is so beaten with old papers, that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle almost four months (" "To be honest: I have overrated my welcome greeting" ") all this seems too nice to be true."</seg>
<seg id="2303">"Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian" new "castle, viewing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle, such as the mounted hyena heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch."</seg>
<seg id="2304">"he wandered through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle, and spoke to the painters, gardeners, and sometimes also with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book."</seg>
<seg id="2305">"then, at night he drank" whiskey and began to write. "</seg>
<seg id="2306">"the intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown, since the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heir, Elizabeth Hussey, died."</seg>
<seg id="2307">"when Rhodes arrived a decade later, the employees just began to take care of the archive, which he described as" hundreds of years in which aristocrats said "Oh, throw it on the attic." "</seg>
<seg id="2308">"diaries, letters from the time of the English Empire, cards representing what possessed:" one could think that land conflicts would be boring, "Rhodes says," but there was a birch to fight the two families. "</seg>
<seg id="2309">"guys, let all go his course!"</seg>
<seg id="2310">"some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a base to dive into English history, among them 'The Labourer', which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant uprising of 1381."</seg>
<seg id="2311">"there is a record of an uprising that occurred in the castle in 1380, in this book entitled 'Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex', Rhodes says."</seg>
<seg id="2312">"the peasant uprising began in this area, and I thought an uprising was a good start."</seg>
<seg id="2313">Perhaps the two are interconnected? "</seg>
<seg id="2314">"other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as' The Priest ', which tells the story of the Jesuit patron, which the family Darrell hid for seven years during the English Reformation."</seg>
<seg id="2315">"or 'The Smuggler', in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell is represented from the 18th century, who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones (a discovery made only years later when his coffin was excavated)."</seg>
<seg id="2316">"the Darrells are Rhodes's favourite family of Scotney:" "the gentlemen seemed to be quite bunches, and always pay debts and spend money for things they could not afford."</seg>
<seg id="2317">"other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking guys, with a talent to advertise within."</seg>
<seg id="2318">"after the end of his involvement in the castle, Rhodes is in search of other unique writing experiences"</seg>
<seg id="2319">"he has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Eläkelmäki, the grounds of a sanatorium from the early 20th century, which has since been reclaimed by nature."</seg>

<seg id="2338">"every year at the beginning of August, the Supreme Military Council (YAS) advises on retirements and promotions in the officer corps."</seg>
<seg id="2339">So also this week.</seg>
<seg id="2340">At first glance a normal process.</seg>
<seg id="2341">But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces a year after the coup attempt.</seg>

<seg id="2343">"under the chairmanship of the Heads of Government, the five Deputy Prime Ministers and the Minister for Defence, Home Affairs, Justice and Foreign Affairs also took part in the discussions."</seg>

<seg id="2348">"more than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the Exile Preacher Fethullah Gülen, which Erdogan sees as the wirehead of the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="2349">"against 486 persons, who have been directly involved in the coup attempt, will be negotiated in Ankara since this week."</seg>
<seg id="2350">"already on the day after the coup, Erdogan was called" "God's gift", "because he gave him the opportunity to completely clean the armed forces."</seg>
<seg id="2351">But does Erdogan really have a grip on the army?</seg>
<seg id="2352">"at the end of February, the newspaper" Hürriyet "published an article titled" Unhairy in the Military Headquarters. ""</seg>
<seg id="2353">"there are concerns in the general staff because of an increasing" Islamisation "of the army, which, among other things, manifests itself in the lifting of the veil for soldiers, wrote the newspaper."</seg>
<seg id="2354">"in any case, the big purist in the army and the security forces continues."</seg>
<seg id="2355">"in mid-July, Erdogan ordered another 7395 state servants by decree, including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers."</seg>
<seg id="2356">It seemed like Erdogan has tamed the military.</seg>
<seg id="2357">The generals were formerly considered to be the real lords of the country.</seg>
<seg id="2358">Three times they putted their role as guardians of the secular state order.</seg>
<seg id="2359">"following his victory in 2002, Erdogan pressed the power of the military step by step, not least by calling on the European Union's reform demands."</seg>
<seg id="2360">Former officers say Erdogan is systematically pushing a Islamization of the armed forces.</seg>

<seg id="2389">"just as you thought it could not become even more crazy in 2017, a new report on the technological developments in the area of sex robots is coming."</seg>
<seg id="2390">"yes, indeed."</seg>
<seg id="2391">Sex robots are currently a big thing.</seg>
<seg id="2392">The Foundation for Responsible Robotics (FRR) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years.</seg>
<seg id="2393">"according to Noel Sharkey, Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR, we must start taking her ascension seriously."</seg>
<seg id="2394">"customers can choose the eye color of the robot, its shape of the nipple and the type of fingernail."</seg>
<seg id="2395">"people make fun of them, but companies deliver a lot of them and we will see them much more often," "said Mr. Sharkey on the publication of his new report."</seg>
<seg id="2396">Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions that are achieved by artificial intelligence.</seg>
<seg id="2397">"the user can also" "adapt" "his robot according to his beliefs and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the shape of the nipples to the type or color of his fingernails."</seg>
<seg id="2398">"but it becomes even more disturbing, as many robots have the" personalities "that a stepford woman would look progressive."</seg>
<seg id="2399">Modern sex dolls have developed into robots with a silicone skin.</seg>
<seg id="2400">"the RealBotix robot, for example, enables its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing, such as shyness."</seg>
<seg id="2401">"and then there is the Roxxxxx Gold sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as" Frigid Farrah, "which gives the impression of shyness and" Wild Wendy "with an" adventurous "personality."</seg>
<seg id="2402">"Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as well as possible," enthuses the True Companion site. "</seg>
<seg id="2403">"so she likes what you like, and she doesn't like what you don't like, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2404">"in the course of the day, she also has her moods - just like real people!"</seg>
<seg id="2405">"she can be tired, fixed to conversation or she can be" "in mood" "!"</seg>
<seg id="2406">"there are many disturbing aspects for this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the submissive female features, the allurement to rape, when one goes a step towards Frigid (means here: reluctant) Farrah to concern, unsettled one the most."</seg>
<seg id="2407">"on his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator, but for men."</seg>
<seg id="2408">"if women (sic) can have a vibrator, why can men not have a Roxxxy?" it says on the website. "</seg>
<seg id="2409">"however, these sex robots are not just a fetish or just just another sex toy."</seg>
<seg id="2410">"their formation and increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture, to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition."</seg>
<seg id="2411">"most men of course will not hold any sex robots, and while the FRR noted their rising popularity, they still remain on the verge of consumer culture."</seg>
<seg id="2412">"but what transpires from the marginal zones, can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of time in which we live."</seg>
<seg id="2413">And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives permission to do so.</seg>
<seg id="2414">"there is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots appear in a time when women's rights are threatened worldwide, in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted to have women sexually assaulted."</seg>
<seg id="2415">"the most horrible aspect of the television series' The Handmaid's Tale '(' The report of the handmaid ') are not the graphic images, the worn bodies and the out-out eyes, but how realistic this vision works."</seg>
<seg id="2416">"the Republic of Gilead is a leap, but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap."</seg>
<seg id="2417">The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible (albeit with pornostar proportions).</seg>
<seg id="2418">Their builders want them to feel human that they imitate the movement of a real body.</seg>
<seg id="2419">"but, when it comes to their" personalities, "the robots are not real women."</seg>
<seg id="2420">They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away.</seg>
<seg id="2421">"they have no mediation or background history, nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total submission."</seg>
<seg id="2422">"in other words, they are false slaves."</seg>
<seg id="2423">Or to express it in the phrase of 2017: maids</seg>
<seg id="2424">Trump Great performance?</seg>
<seg id="2425">He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of healthy human understanding</seg>

<seg id="2432">"with Trump in the White House everyone who knows it, including the republican kinship with which she struggled for decades because of politics, suddenly and quite strange on the same side."</seg>
<seg id="2433">"this is certainly a good thing around the dining table, but it seems to me in a further context that this also entails considerable risks."</seg>
<seg id="2434">"the left was strengthened by Trump, but the disfiguring effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right."</seg>
<seg id="2435">"when we speak of" "normalization" "and Trump, we refer to the creepy possibility that one day his kittens will no longer be repulsed."</seg>
<seg id="2436">"there is, however, an even frightening long-term scenario in which Trump republicans of the right wing" normalizes "which suddenly appear as the epitome of reasonableness in comparison to its standards."</seg>
<seg id="2437">"today I find myself falling apart from an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney's hilarious version of the madman - the dog on the car roof, the 14% income tax (but at least we knew how his tax return looked) - both compared to Trump would indeed occur to a very mild offence."</seg>
<seg id="2438">"when Trump goes, the next candidate of the Republicans must be spiritually healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement."</seg>

<seg id="2535">"Roland Wacker, Haslachs Stadtbaumeister, will retire in retirement next year."</seg>
<seg id="2536">"the place is already written out, but suitable candidates are rar."</seg>
<seg id="2537">"for 31 years, Wacker has been the city master."</seg>
<seg id="2538">And the work still makes him great fun as he mediates in the press talk.</seg>
<seg id="2539">"he reports on varied, but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor."</seg>
<seg id="2540">"at the same time, it is surprising that until now no application has fulfilled the requirements profile."</seg>
<seg id="2541">The city is looking for an architect or civil engineer at the earliest possible time.</seg>
<seg id="2542">"in this way, taking into account the regular periods of notice, there is still enough time for a revision."</seg>
<seg id="2543">"since Haslach acts as a subcontractor for the administrative community, the applicant must present corresponding conclusions."</seg>
<seg id="2544">Because this function wants to keep the city in any case.</seg>
<seg id="2545">"if they could no longer fill them in, the citizens would have to travel to Offenburg."</seg>
<seg id="2546">"but the closeness to the town is important to the city and to it, says Wacker, who talks about a good working climate and a good mood between the authorities and citizens."</seg>
<seg id="2547">"in more than 30 years in office, some important projects have gathered to look back on the Wacker with pride."</seg>
<seg id="2548">"we make the city worth living," he is confident about the Bauhaus and his employees. "</seg>
<seg id="2549">But also in the future varied projects are on the agenda: the redesign of the former Hukla-Areas and the Niederhofen parking lot have come across.</seg>
<seg id="2550">The zigzag bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed and the stadium renovation is still a topic.</seg>
<seg id="2551">"the latter will be hit by some 1.5 million euros," if we do it right, "Wacker appreciates."</seg>
<seg id="2552">"" "all in all, great tasks await my successor."</seg>
<seg id="2553">The work here is fun. "</seg>
<seg id="2554">"for a city master, there is a lot of room for manoeuvre."</seg>
<seg id="2555">"with Haslach's own building yard and gardener, it is possible to react flexibly to many."</seg>
<seg id="2556">"you can move a lot," says Wacker, and the design of the green spaces is often mentioned by citizens and visitors. "</seg>
<seg id="2557">"as the old town stands as an ensemble under monument protection, it is important to" have an eye for what is going on "when new buildings are approved, the outgoing city building master emphasizes."</seg>
<seg id="2558">"anyway, the mayor bears high responsibility."</seg>
<seg id="2559">"he is a builder," "in the end everything goes over my table."</seg>
<seg id="2560">"with support and coordination, he can count on many years of staff: Markus Neumaier (Hochbau) has been working for ten years, Manfred Schöner (civil engineering) has been working for 15 years."</seg>
<seg id="2561">"also, that his successor remains long, Wacker wants:" "we are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and left with the job."</seg>
<seg id="2562">"continuity is not only important for a good working climate, but also for the further design of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2563">"if you would like to bury Roland Wacker, you should have completed a completed studies as a diploma engineer or Bachelor's degree with the subject area architecture and have good knowledge in the fields of building and construction planning."</seg>
<seg id="2564">"the Stadtbauamt accommodates high and civil engineering, construction guidelines, grundering opportunities, administration of municipal real estate, Municipal working yard with building yard and municipal gardening, as well as sub-construction legal authority including monument protection."</seg>
<seg id="2565">Bicycle tossed to leads: runway closed</seg>
<seg id="2566">"according to the police, the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the railway slide transfer in the area of Leoben Street (B116) to the leaderships."</seg>
<seg id="2567">These were damaged in such a way that the approaching freight train had to be stopped.</seg>
<seg id="2568">The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and have been searching for them since the night.</seg>
<seg id="2569">Near the scene witnessed a rosy scooter and a bicycle driver.</seg>
<seg id="2570">"this goes far beyond a Lausannobenstein," said ÖBB spokesperson Christoph Posch at the APA. "</seg>
<seg id="2571">The perpetrators themselves would have put themselves in danger and also jeopardized the train traffic.</seg>
<seg id="2572">"in addition to the damage to the locomotive and the system, as well as the delays and costs for rail freight transport, there may also be sponsors of rail customers to the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2573">"overall, a" substantial "sum would be assumed, the spokesman said."</seg>
<seg id="2574">"the damage was repaired on Friday afternoon, the railway traffic on the south railway track could be managed without obstructions."</seg>
<seg id="2575">"almost ten passenger trains were out on Friday morning, two of them entered the correspondence."</seg>
<seg id="2576">"there were no freight trains, but they were belatedly."</seg>
<seg id="2577">"according to ÖBB spokesperson, Christoph Posch, around 200 metres of overhead lines had to be replaced."</seg>
<seg id="2578">Insulators and masts have also been damaged.</seg>
<seg id="2579">"red meat, dairy products and chocolate could help alleviate IBD (inflammatory bowel disease)"</seg>
<seg id="2580">Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system.</seg>
<seg id="2581">"but a new study says exactly the opposite: a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products, could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel diseases."</seg>
<seg id="2582">"the incurable state, which affects approximately 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United States, causes stomach cramps and flatulence, recurrent or bloody diarrhea, weight loss and extreme fatigue."</seg>
<seg id="2583">"while those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms, researchers at Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant gut."</seg>
<seg id="2584">"the conductive researcher, Dr. Marco Colonna, explained that immune cells are patrolling in the gut to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body."</seg>
<seg id="2585">"cells that are able to trigger inflammation, are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging the tissue."</seg>
<seg id="2586">"if the balance is too far in the direction of inflammation, it can result in inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2587">"experiments have been observed that a type of tolerance promoting immune cell in mice is found, which carry a specific bacterium in their bowels."</seg>
<seg id="2588">And the bacterium needs tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells.</seg>
<seg id="2589">Professor Colonna said: "we have established a connection between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the gut microbiome and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance.</seg>
<seg id="2590">"the more tryptophan had the mice in their food, the more they had from these immune cells."</seg>
<seg id="2591">"he suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes tolerant, less inflammatory bowel milieus, if the same system is wirling also with people."</seg>
<seg id="2592">"post-doctoral researcher Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan searched for a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when she found out that a group of study mice had such cells, but another group of the same tribe, which was however separated, did not."</seg>
<seg id="2593">"they suspected that the difference with the intestinal microbial chromosomes had to do - the community of bacteria, viruses and fungi, which normally live in the gastrointestinal tract."</seg>
<seg id="2594">"the intestines of the mice were DNA sequenced and there were found six bacterial species present in mice with the immune cells, but without them missing in mice."</seg>
<seg id="2595">Mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked an intestinal microbiome and they did not develop this kind of immune cells and they were given the L. Cross and the immune cells.</seg>
<seg id="2596">"in order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system, the researchers L. reuteri continued to grow in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of the liquid - without the bacteria - on unripe immune cells, which were isolated from the mice."</seg>
<seg id="2597">The immune cells developed into the tolerance-promoting cells.</seg>
<seg id="2598">"when the active component was cleaned out of the liquid, it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism, known as an idol-3 lactic acid."</seg>
<seg id="2599">"when the researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice's food, the number of these cells increased by about 50 percent, but when tryptophan was halved, the number of cells dropped by half."</seg>
<seg id="2600">Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-enhancing cells as mice and that most of us L. repent in our gastrointestinal tracts.</seg>
<seg id="2601">"it is not known whether tryptophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice, but defects in genes in relation to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory bowel disease."</seg>
<seg id="2602">She said: "the development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine.</seg>
<seg id="2603">Potentially high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population. "</seg>

<seg id="2634">The Green German Managing Director Michael Kellner urged the stubborn Lower Saxony Member of the Green party Elke Twest to return their mandate.</seg>
<seg id="2635">The transition to CDU means a clear falsification of the voter's will.</seg>
<seg id="2636">"Elke Tables must immediately return her mandate," "said the Federal Executive Officer and campaign manager of the Green editorial network (RND)."</seg>

<seg id="2638">"Stephan Weil, SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony, stands after the transfer of the green deputies Elke Twest to the CDU without its own government majority."</seg>
<seg id="2639">It is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD's state associations.</seg>

<seg id="2676">"at that time, in the rehabilitation region I from 1991 to 2004, the state of Baden-Württemberg has taken over two thirds of the funding amount."</seg>
<seg id="2677">"in the refurbishment area II from 2005 to 2016, the subsidy was still 60 percent."</seg>
<seg id="2678">"for Schindler, the existing renovations are a" success project "- it is finally important to also promote the interior development, and not only to open up new areas of construction."</seg>
<seg id="2679">"on April 4, the Government Presidium Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a refurbishment area III."</seg>
<seg id="2680">"the amount of funding amounted to 833 333 euros, of which 500 000 Euros came from the country, the rest of the commune's sensitivities."</seg>

<seg id="2682">"one will, so Schindler continue to study, where the" "really old" "houses are."</seg>
<seg id="2683">"however, it also plays a role if there is an interest in the planned area."</seg>
<seg id="2684">"if necessary, the area limits could then be moved again."</seg>
<seg id="2685">"the proponents represented Martin Keller, Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening."</seg>
<seg id="2686">"basement presented the contents of the federal state programme" Social City, "in which the renovations would then be carried out."</seg>
<seg id="2687">"the core of the program is the revitalisation of city cities, improving the living and working conditions and maintaining and expanding the infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="2688">"the measures would be object-related, i.e. per plot."</seg>
<seg id="2689">The restructuring area would eventually be established as a statute.</seg>
<seg id="2690">The approval period for the funding period has expired since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026.</seg>
<seg id="2691">"until September this year, however, the stocktaking will be carried out only once, within the framework of which the participants involved in the rehabilitation area will receive a questionnaire for filling out."</seg>
<seg id="2692">"in November or December, as soon as possible, the sentence shall be carried out so that it can begin with the refurbishment in the coming year."</seg>
<seg id="2693">Pietzschmann subsequently declared that each commune had to carry out the said pre-trial investigations.</seg>
<seg id="2694">"it is a matter of assessing and deciding upon the conditions of the city, and to decide when it will be restored and to what extent."</seg>
<seg id="2695">There will also be a refurbishment note in the land register for the respective plot.</seg>
<seg id="2696">"Pietzschmann will once again come to sensations and get a picture of the situation, she promised."</seg>
<seg id="2697">Goth emphasised that a key success factor for the project was the participation of the participants.</seg>
<seg id="2698">"this is why there will be questionnaires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks, and can be filled up until the end of the summer holidays."</seg>
<seg id="2699">"the yellow questionnaire is the" "building and property sheet", "where, among other things, it is about the structural condition and the remediation views."</seg>

<seg id="2701">The blue "operating bow" is only to be filled when in the building business premises are operated.</seg>
<seg id="2702">"however, to be aware, Gottschou pointed out that a filled questionnaire was not at the same time an application for funding."</seg>

<seg id="2715">"the White House's decision to fly a navy helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost taxpayers according to the military information left to TIME magazine, up to 24,000 US dollars."</seg>
<seg id="2716">"the green-white Sikorsky VH-3D, known as Marine One, when the president is on board, was the heart of the event on July 17th in the White House with American construction programs."</seg>
<seg id="2717">"President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and senior officials of the White House, made a tour of products from all 50 countries."</seg>
<seg id="2718">"the helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited in addition to a yacht from Maine, a Wisconsin fire-fighting car and a forklift from Mississippi."</seg>
<seg id="2719">"the White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or Frago, barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn, according to the records of the Navy Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1), the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter."</seg>
<seg id="2720">"I just wanted you to be aware of it, because it's such an unusual event with high visibility," wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event, the Deputy Naval Commander for Aviation. "</seg>
<seg id="2721">"the message showed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn at 7 o'clock in the morning for the event at 3 p.m., and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18: 00 and 21: 00 on that evening."</seg>
<seg id="2722">The note adds that if the flight from the White House should be delayed due to the limitation of service hours a second squad would be required for the return flight.</seg>
<seg id="2723">"the original flight crew was during the event with the helicopter, while the safety personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time on the aircraft."</seg>
<seg id="2724">"from the notes provided by the TIME, it was not clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately required."</seg>
<seg id="2725">The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers to use state property for political purposes.</seg>
<seg id="2726">Records show that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the determination.</seg>
<seg id="2727">"a question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case," the commandant wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="2728">"sounds as if you were locked," replied the deputy commander. "</seg>
<seg id="2729">The event "Made in America" was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act.</seg>
<seg id="2730">But official events also have political overtones.</seg>
<seg id="2731">"at the event, the president gave an impetus to reform of the health reform that was going on in the Senate and he propagated efforts to curb government regulations."</seg>
<seg id="2732">"the use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One, for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon."</seg>
<seg id="2733">Presidents are obliged to use them for travel.</seg>
<seg id="2734">But demanding their use only for a photo surgery is unusual.</seg>
<seg id="2735">"in February, Trump conducted an investigation when the Presidential powered aircraft stood in front of the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida, taxi services, and his Twitter account is full of news that complained about the use of the presidential jet by its predecessor."</seg>

<seg id="2737">HMX-1 crew frequently carry out training flights in the Washington and South Lawn area to reduce the U.S. President in the White House with precise centimeters.</seg>
<seg id="2738">"when Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July, HMX-1 introduced 58 practice landings at the White House."</seg>
<seg id="2739">"the flight for the" "Made in America" "event counted during the training needs of the flight crew for the month, said an officer."</seg>
<seg id="2740">"helicopter units also flew 11 hours on that day for" "non-Presidency support missions." ""</seg>
<seg id="2741">The White House said that taxpayers overtook the burden for none of the other props presented at the event.</seg>
<seg id="2742">A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in putting helicopters on the South Lawn.</seg>
<seg id="2743">"HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights, and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event."</seg>
<seg id="2744">"according to the US Secretary of Defense for fiscal 2017, the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24,380 USD per flight hour."</seg>
<seg id="2745">Records of unit record the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia.</seg>
<seg id="2746">The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate.</seg>
<seg id="2747">"the cost of taxpayers based on estimates for reimbursement rates is highly misleading," "said Walters."</seg>
<seg id="2748">"these estimates include personnel, maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual means."</seg>
<seg id="2749">"according to a RAND study from 2015, the refunds for DoD do not contain personnel costs, but take into account the costs of fuel, maintenance and contract completion."</seg>
<seg id="2750">"at that time, the former spokesman of the White House, Sean Spicer, defended the use of the helicopter for the event."</seg>
<seg id="2751">"the idea is to present things this week that are made in America," "said Spicer."</seg>
<seg id="2752">"and I know Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security, and I assume that hundreds, if not even thousands of people depend on it."</seg>
<seg id="2753">And I think like most Americans we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly.</seg>
<seg id="2754">"of course, it is appropriate to highlight this."</seg>
<seg id="2755">"it was not clear if Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event, but he sat down in the driver's seat of a fire truck."</seg>
<seg id="2756">"in the White House, Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and shook with the media about his own fleet of company products."</seg>

<seg id="2889">The Regensburger Domspatzen-Report about the misuse cases relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger.</seg>
<seg id="2890">The author and historian Michael Hesemann refers to this.</seg>
<seg id="2891">The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen provides further discussions.</seg>
<seg id="2892">"Christian Weisnder, spokesman of the reform movement" We are Church, "explained after publishing to the German press agency, he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and current Cardinal Georg Ratzinger, the 93-year-old brother of the emeried Pope Benedict XVI, an apology."</seg>
<seg id="2893">"it would serve to serve the prestige of the Catholic Church, if Müller and Ratzinger would express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the processes."</seg>
<seg id="2894">"the Vatican newspaper" Osservatore Romano, "on the other hand, criticized that in reporting on violence against the dome-cats with" "two measures". ""</seg>
<seg id="2895">"in respect of the assaults in Regensburg, no one doubt that it is a matter of" shameful and shameful acts, "which would have to be punished and prevented in the future; however, the author Lucetta Scarparia, historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics committee."</seg>
<seg id="2896">"the habit of calling the Catholic Church as the source of all evil is already part of everyday life and prepares the public mind to keep it normal," writes Scarparia. "</seg>
<seg id="2897">"Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis, too, said in an interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk:" "one likes to go to the church and that is a found fresco."</seg>
<seg id="2898">"she also pointed out that in her youth," strikes have been a very normal educational means "to be done with cheeky children as I was one."</seg>
<seg id="2899">"it is unfair to apply today's standards for earlier decades, as the world has changed."</seg>
<seg id="2900">"in connection with the reports on the misuse cases, Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often also appeared."</seg>
<seg id="2901">"author and historian Michael Hesemann, author and historian Michael Hesemann, wrote the book" My brother of the Pope "with Ratzinger (translated into 12 languages)."</seg>
<seg id="2902">"I must take the protection of Georg Ratzinger," says Hesemann, "for all this had nothing to do with him," he analyzes the results of the final report. "</seg>
<seg id="2903">What exactly is in the 440-page report submitted by the diocese Regensburg with the Enlightenment lawyer Ulrich Weber?</seg>
<seg id="2904">"a total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen, between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s, were" "with high plausibility" "victims of assaults, 67 domed cats sexually abused."</seg>
<seg id="2905">"in the final report, it is said to Georg Ratzinger who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994:" "in summary, it can be said that by Domkapellmeister in many cases, forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied."</seg>
<seg id="2906">"especially with a high degree of emotionality, the punishment for the students could also be more violent."</seg>
<seg id="2907">"in contrast to many other defendants, however, many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore in numerous cases even positive memories are associated with him in many cases despite violence."</seg>
<seg id="2908">"in the interview, Hesemann explains why the final report on the misuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger is relieved of his opinion."</seg>
<seg id="2909">"Mr. Hesemann, the 440-page report on the" incidents of violence on protective grounds at the Regensburger Domspatzen "is a contradictory picture of the cathedral-master Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2910">"on the one hand, many students highlight his" humanity. ""</seg>
<seg id="2911">"on the other hand, he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist who became more tangible when a domain record musically did not produce top performance."</seg>
<seg id="2912">How do you evaluate this final report as his biographer?</seg>
<seg id="2913">"Michael Hesemann: if you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages from the front to the back, you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is present at all."</seg>
<seg id="2914">"there are eight pages dedicated to him, and he is clearly acquitted by any suspicion of complicity or mitigation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse."</seg>
<seg id="2915">The non-violence at the pre-school also took place outside of its sphere of influence.</seg>
<seg id="2916">"at best, one can reproach him, too late, or to have first hints not taken seriously enough."</seg>
<seg id="2917">"the gymnasium, on which it worked, was felt by practically all the surveyed as - literally -" redemption, "" heaven "and" better world. ""</seg>
<seg id="2918">"the vast majority of his disciples Georg Ratzinger also testify," "warm hearted," "" "sincere," "" sincere, "" competent "and" understanding, "as an extremely good-natured teacher who supplied the boys with cakes, biscuits and sweets and" always surrounded by the grapes of children. ""</seg>
<seg id="2919">"only a minority is complaining about his perfectionism and his high emotionality, which also led to flood damage."</seg>
<seg id="2920">"that he didn't just pop up with chairs and threw the keychain on the ground, but also drew up earrings and too cheeky guys on the hair or ears, he has given himself years ago, deeply regretted and apologized for this."</seg>
<seg id="2921">"to his salvation, however, it must be said that such methods of education were widespread in the late 1960s, the 1960s and 1970s, with parents as well as with teachers."</seg>
<seg id="2922">Do you also know such breeding methods?</seg>
<seg id="2923">"of course, I think every one of us was born before 1968."</seg>
<seg id="2924">"I also experienced this in a secular school, a high school."</seg>
<seg id="2925">"compared to what it is actually about in this report, namely the horrific sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at the pre-school, this is true of baguars."</seg>
<seg id="2926">"one wonders if it is not to do with his fame and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI, that many media rushed straight to him."</seg>
<seg id="2927">"there are many who never understood him at the Bavarian Palace, still zealous."</seg>
<seg id="2928">But the truth is: the report is relieved by Georg Ratzinger in every respect!</seg>
<seg id="2929">"in connection with the report, the media reported a lot about the topic of abuse at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2930">Will Georg Ratzinger be accused of any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse in the final report?</seg>
<seg id="2931">Michael Hesemann: no. no.</seg>
<seg id="2932">Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claimed to have entrusted himself to the cathedral prison master.</seg>
<seg id="2933">Not even the parents were inaugurated.</seg>
<seg id="2934">"I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it," "said one concerned representative for the others," "It was all very embarrassing to me."</seg>
<seg id="2935">"the real problem with the clarification of sexual abuse was, however, that most victims of shame remain silent."</seg>
<seg id="2936">"if they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings, then certainly not a choral director, who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="2937">How do the Domspatzen-Students Ratzinger's role in terms of the misuse cases?</seg>
<seg id="2938">Michael Hesemann: a questionable student said: "regarding sexual abuse... I see... no case in which he would have had timely findings and could have stopped the perpetrator.</seg>
<seg id="2939">"I think it... also for really absurd to assume that out of it... Buying unobtrusive or clearer or even more open than to their parents, dormitory managers, confidence teachers, etc."</seg>
<seg id="2940">That you talk to him about sex... - unthinkable.</seg>
<seg id="2941">"this is how the report comes to the very clear result:" "that the student and / or their environment were entrusted to him in advance, could not be confirmed in the investigation."</seg>
<seg id="2942">"as for sexual abuse, Georg Ratzinger is thus free to speak of everyone."</seg>
<seg id="2943">"in this way, it cannot be accused of preventing it or having brought it to the display."</seg>
<seg id="2944">"therefore, there is no reason to associate his good name with these conflicting crimes, as it was unfortunately done in some cases."</seg>
<seg id="2945">"in the media, a lot of" "violent excesses" "were to be read at the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2946">"the former domain master Georg Ratzinger is accused of" "looking away" "in the report."</seg>
<seg id="2947">Does he have to live with this accusation?</seg>
<seg id="2948">"Michael Hesemann: this is the big problem that everything is mixed up and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence, and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger."</seg>
<seg id="2949">But that is exactly the abuse of the report.</seg>
<seg id="2950">"namely, it is cleanly separated: between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the Domspatzen, between sexual abuse and non-violence as well as, let's say, other allegations."</seg>
<seg id="2951">"in addition, the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945, thus also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choral director of the Domspatzen."</seg>
<seg id="2952">"the whole terrible test pedagogy, the cases in which boys of sadistic teachers were scaled and painted, and who suffered terribly, were all at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen, where really scandalous conditions have prevailed."</seg>
<seg id="2953">"but with those of whom Domenellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do, because he only got the boys face when they were already at the gymnasium gymnasium."</seg>
<seg id="2954">"on this, as most of the witnesses stress, the theme" "preschool" "was taboo."</seg>
<seg id="2955">One was only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even "paradise" states.</seg>
<seg id="2956">What was different at the gymnasium gymnasium?</seg>
<seg id="2957">"Michael Hesemann: there was discipline, but no sadistic violence."</seg>
<seg id="2958">"this also applies to Georg Ratzinger, where the report concludes that" "many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. and therefore, in many cases despite violence, even combine positive memories with him."</seg>
<seg id="2959">At most it remains the reproach to have looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2960">"but despite all efforts, the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school."</seg>
<seg id="2961">"the first time in 1970 / 71, when he had just started to establish himself and was responsible for the events at a school where he did not work and was responsible (so the witness) did not want to hear anything, and then again around 1993."</seg>
<seg id="2962">Did Georg Ratzinger consistently afford ears in front of the states?</seg>
<seg id="2963">"Michael Hesemann: no, because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the dome gymnasium, which the report even reproduced."</seg>
<seg id="2964">"in this he points to it," "that in the pre-school the punishment is still practiced."</seg>
<seg id="2965">"in the face of the danger of negative press releases, he recommended urgent action."</seg>
<seg id="2966">"that was, of course, at a time when legal clarity consisted of being banned in Bavaria since long ago."</seg>
<seg id="2967">"before that, they happened in a legal grey area, as each of us still knows."</seg>
<seg id="2968">"it was difficult for him to assess where the sufferers were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised, and where really the permissible limit had been exceeded."</seg>
<seg id="2969">But you can't say that he always had looked away.</seg>
<seg id="2970">This is simply not true.</seg>
<seg id="2971">"only in 1980, the death penalty was officially abolished in schools in Bavaria."</seg>
<seg id="2972">"Princess Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards to the time that was at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2973">How do you see it?</seg>
<seg id="2974">"Michael Hesemann: we historians talk about the" pitfalls of anachronism, "which is the danger of the past to evaluate past moral standards."</seg>
<seg id="2975">The princess is right.</seg>
<seg id="2976">"but this naturally does not apply to sexual abuse, which at all times was abominable and also not for what was done in the pre-school of adversity and violence at innocent children's boards, which goes far beyond that."</seg>
<seg id="2977">This is all very dreadful and I'm glad that it will finally work.</seg>
<seg id="2978">"but at the same time, I must take the protection of Georg Ratzinger, because all this had nothing to do with him."</seg>
<seg id="2979">"his means of disciplining and punishing, i.e. earners and hair and ears, were widespread in the 1970s."</seg>
<seg id="2980">"as physical punishment was then banned, he has also kept strictly adhering to it."</seg>
<seg id="2981">"what picture of his time in Regensburg, Georg Ratzinger, has shown in the conversations with you for the book" "My brother of the pope" "?"</seg>
<seg id="2982">Did the subject of test fine also become a language?</seg>
<seg id="2983">"Michael Hesemann: well, in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph, that is, Pope Benedict XVI, from his perspective, since the Domspatzen played only a minor role."</seg>
<seg id="2984">"nevertheless, I do not by any means conceal that he led there a strict regiment."</seg>
<seg id="2985">"but even this must be said: without this perfectionism, without the demand of unconditional discipline, it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world trang from the hitherto rather nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen, true cultural ambassadors of Europe and his musical tradition, which went on tour twice in the USA (1983 and 1987) and Japan (1988 and 1991)."</seg>
<seg id="2986">"with biscuits and candy alone, one does not make a great singer and a great singer before any success, no matter what area, but always discipline, passion and overcoming."</seg>
<seg id="2987">What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks about her book?</seg>
<seg id="2988">"Michael Hesemann: through the work on the book and beyond, I have learned to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again and again as a wonderful, humorous, base-good, deeply believing and warm-hearted man, from whom you can't imagine that he could do something even a fly."</seg>
<seg id="2989">"I regularly get to see how many former dome-cats are still today, 23 years after his Emerization, regularly contact him, visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family."</seg>
<seg id="2990">"those who do not forgive him until today, that he was once strictly speaking to them, are clearly in the minority."</seg>
<seg id="2991">Most Domspatzen are grateful to him today that he has enriched their lives and brought them to the world of music.</seg>
<seg id="2992">"and that he is always a good, fatherly teacher - a strict father, certainly, that may be - but yet also a desirable respectable person, to which they still look up today and which they almost revere."</seg>
<seg id="2993">"and please, again quite clearly: everything you reproach upon are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time."</seg>
<seg id="2994">We can be happy that we have long since overcome this time.</seg>
<seg id="2995">"but it is most unjust, a man just because he is prominently and has an even more prominent brother to become a medial scapegoat."</seg>
<seg id="2996">"there is the evil intent behind it, only too obvious."</seg>
<seg id="2997">"the report, which has just been published, relieves it."</seg>
<seg id="2998">"now the settlement would stop, a 93-year-old man who bought great merits and without whom no one would know the Regensburger Domspatzen, without leaving Bavaria's and maybe even Germany, to finally leave the Regensburger Domspatzen."</seg>
