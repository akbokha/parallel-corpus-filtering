28 @-@ year @-@ old cook found dead in San Francisco Mall
a 28 @-@ year @-@ old chef who recently moved to San Francisco was found dead in the staircase of a local shopping mall .
&quot; the victim &apos;s brother said that he can &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm him , &quot; &quot; Fin@@ ally he went up with him again . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ se found on Wednesday morning in the West@@ field Mall was identified as the 28 year old Frank Gali@@ cia from San Francisco , divided the medical department in San Francisco . &quot;
the San Francisco Police Department said death was classified as murder and the investigation started .
&quot; the brother of the victim , Louis Gali@@ cia , told the ABS station K@@ GO in San Francisco that Frank , who had previously worked as a cook in Boston , got his dream job as a cook at the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters Restaurant in San Francisco six months ago . &quot;
&quot; a spokes@@ man of the S@@ ons &amp; Dau@@ ghters said they were shocked at his death , and were destroyed on the ground . &quot;
&quot; we are a small team working like a close family and we will miss him pain@@ fully , &quot; &quot; said the speaker . &quot;
our thoughts and con@@ dol@@ ences are in this difficult time with Fran@@ ks family and friends .
&quot; Louis Gali@@ cia admitted that Frank lived in host@@ els initially , but that &quot; things went up for him at last . &quot;
&quot; he found an apartment , he had a girlfriend , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gar@@ cia K@@ GO . &quot;
Louis Gali@@ cia said he couldn &apos;t imagine anyone who would harm his younger brother .
he was a friendly person with a great heart .
&quot; connecting his way with his family was to always cook something for us to prepare dinner , &quot; &quot; said Louis Gali@@ cia . &quot;
he never wanted to participate in any kind of confrontation .
he was the brother who sw@@ am with the river .
&quot; with everything going wrong in the world , he was this un@@ polished diamond , who lit every day brigh@@ tly , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
anyone who has information on the case will be asked to call the C@@ RC under number 4@@ 15 @-@ 5@@ 75 @-@ 44@@ 44 .
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston : I will always be put into drawers
J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston doesn &apos;t have to be perfect or successful .
this has made the Hollywood star unmistak@@ ably clear in an interview .
&quot; I &apos;m always plu@@ gged into drawers or glued on the outside label , which have little to do with me and the reality . &quot;
I don &apos;t have the desire to always be perfect and successful .
&quot; to be honest , these things are rather s@@ nu@@ ff to me . &quot;
&quot; J@@ enni@@ fer Ani@@ ston ( 47 ) can only laugh about it as &quot; &quot; Miss Perfect &quot; , &quot; as explained in the current Cos@@ m@@ opolitan . &quot;
&quot; the act@@ ress enjoys spending her time at home , watching TV with lo@@ cker@@ proof de@@ br@@ is and Mexican food , it is said in the magazine . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we don &apos;t have to be married or have children to be perfect , &quot; &quot; said the Hollywood star . &quot;
in her new film &quot; Mother &apos;s Day - Love is not a children &apos;s play &quot; Ani@@ ston is seen as an all@@ uring mother of two sons .
the film will run by us on August 25th .
gol@@ fer Lan@@ ger receives the sports pyramid
his experiences on the horse are man@@ a@@ geable .
at the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Lan@@ ger with some colleagues sought a bit of di@@ version with a ride on the beach .
for the 58 @-@ year @-@ old it was a premiere .
CH@@ IO : &quot; golden sports pyramid &quot; for Bernhard Lan@@ ger
&quot; after a few minutes , the horses remembered their holiday , they hun@@ ted at the fast gal@@ lo@@ p home to the feed trou@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; one kilometer at this pace , I was afraid . &quot;
&quot; it was not a good experience , &quot; Lan@@ ger says . &quot;
&quot; and with that , the riding career then ended up again . &quot;
&quot; on Saturday , Germany &apos;s best gol@@ fer was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses . &quot;
&quot; he let his family run over the grounds of the AL@@ RV , on a horse he didn &apos;t even ho@@ ver for photo purposes . &quot;
it was the first time in Aachen and thus at CH@@ IO .
the reason was quite convincing .
the German sports team handed over to the man from An@@ hausen in the course of a small gala the golden sports pyramid .
the li@@ ke@@ able sports@@ man does not lack ac@@ col@@ ades .
&quot; Federal Cross of Mer@@ it , Silver bay leaf , Champions Tour player of the year ... &quot;
even the British Queen has already ad@@ ored him .
the 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid is a long one .
&quot; in Aachen , on Saturday , he met the first prize @-@ winner Hans Günter Win@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; this award means a lot to me , &quot; says Lan@@ ger , &quot; because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment . &quot;
&quot; for decades , Lan@@ ger has been promoting the offspring . &quot;
&quot; and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away . &quot;
&quot; with 15 other outstanding athletes , the two @-@ time US @-@ Master@@ s@@ si@@ eger was admitted to the &quot; Hall of F@@ ame of German Sports &quot; on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; the ski@@ ers are the athletes of Hart@@ wig Gau@@ der and Harald Schmit@@ t , the fin@@ er Cornelia Han@@ isch , Alexander P@@ usch and Ar@@ nd Schmit@@ t , the Ru@@ derer Peter @-@ Michael Kol@@ be , the Ju@@ do@@ ka Frank Wi@@ en@@ e@@ ke , the jum@@ per Al@@ win Scho@@ ck@@ em@@ öh@@ le and pos@@ thum@@ ously the Hand@@ b@@ aller Er@@ hard Wunder@@ lich . &quot;
many of these sports@@ men came to Aachen on Saturday .
&quot; after the official part , the illustri@@ ous company moved to the Spring@@ stadium , where the Lav@@ azza price was running . &quot;
Bernhard Lan@@ ger kept distance to the big animals .
Clinton &apos;s and Tru@@ mp economic policy in comparison : it &apos;s all about the money
invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement T@@ TP - both Clinton and Tru@@ mp want .
&quot; however , the two US presidential candidates are un@@ equal in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue . &quot;
&quot; the difference in economic policy between Donald Tru@@ mp and H@@ illary Clinton is a fundamental , rather philosophical distinction . &quot;
on the role of the state .
&quot; in doubt , Tru@@ mp wants to keep in doubt small and cau@@ ti@@ ously cau@@ tions about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations . &quot;
&quot; Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death , he says . &quot;
&quot; he himself would be quite different , claiming Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he will massi@@ vely decline regulations , and he is strong for a far @-@ reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton says : the state has to fulfill certain tasks , it has to open dis@@ advant@@ aged opportunities and needs money for it . &quot;
&quot; that is why taxes for the rich would be increased , they say . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , both are very close to infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; in the case of the need to invest , Tru@@ mp and Clinton say almost verb@@ ose . &quot;
the democratic candidate actually announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II .
state investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the Repub@@ lic@@ ans &apos; state @-@ critical wing .
&quot; on Tru@@ mp , there could be still party @-@ internal discussions . &quot;
the differences in energy and climate policy are clear .
Tru@@ mp wants to build coal @-@ fired power plants and re @-@ drive coal mining in the USA .
&quot; oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas , he wants to announce the Par@@ isian climate protection agreement . &quot;
&quot; Clinton , on the other hand , wants to extend and demand renewable energies with its investment program : &quot; &quot; a country will become the super@@ power of clean energy and create millions jobs . &quot;
&quot; it will be either China , Germany or America - I want it to be . &quot;
&quot; but not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements , the two competitors are not too far apart from each other . &quot;
&quot; T@@ PP , the transp@@ it@@ fish trade agreement , both do not want to sign . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , both of them want to isol@@ ate the US from international trade - rather than protect American jobs better . &quot;
&quot; they should then be paid better , e.g. Clinton . &quot;
the current minimum wage of $ 7.@@ 25 is a hunger strike .
he wants to increase it to 15 dollars a hour .
&quot; what Tru@@ mp wants to do in this question is not quite clear : once he says : the minimum wage has to rise , then he says he cannot be changed . &quot;
but the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps .
&quot; on the one hand , Tru@@ mp , who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth . &quot;
his critics regard it so that the budget deficit would be even greater .
&quot; on the other hand , Clinton , at least wants to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes , and their critics say : more taxes are not the solution either . &quot;
&quot; flight : &quot; &quot; every wing@@ ed woman has experiences with sexual violence &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone , almost everyday life . &quot;
&quot; when they arrive in Germany , they are often traumati@@ zed . &quot;
a house offers refuge .
four women are sitting in a large kitchen .
&quot; each one has a baby , which is at most one year old . &quot;
one has put her little son in his arm .
he looked curi@@ ously into the room with big eyes .
his mother star@@ es at the top of the table .
until she notices that she is being watched .
she sm@@ iles short and kis@@ ses the little ones .
the scene seems normal .
until you talk with Kat@@ rin B@@ ahr .
&quot; she is the managing director of Con@@ dro@@ bs , a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria , and deals with the topic of women on the run . &quot;
the four women in the kitchen are P@@ oultry .
they live in the Munich North in one of the few de@@ central accommodations for single @-@ fle@@ dged women and their children in Bavaria .
&quot; in January , Con@@ dro@@ bs created the facility together with Pro Famili@@ a and the Munich Women &apos;s Aid . &quot;
recently it was officially opened .
60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children .
men are not there - also not as a visitor .
the exception is a guard at the door .
&quot; it is not exagger@@ ated to say : every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they thre@@ aten torture or death , or because their families send them hope to Europe , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; in women , there are other reasons for the flight : &quot; &quot; many steal away secretly , because they see no other way out . &quot;
&quot; in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence , forced marri@@ ages , honor mor@@ als , slavery or forced pro@@ stitution . &quot;
that is what drives them away .
on the run it goes on .
&quot; that smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers , for example , demand a sexual act for a bottle of water , is not r@@ arity , &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; the women are alone , they are not protected by their families . &quot;
&quot; who believes that the end , as soon as they arrive in Germany , ir@@ re , tells B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; here too , single women in refugee shel@@ ters would often be considered inferior and mis@@ used at worst . &quot;
&quot; this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women resi@@ ding in the South of Munich are traumati@@ zed , they appreciate it . &quot;
&quot; some of the children are certainly not volunte@@ ered . &quot;
many women are used to saying nothing .
&quot; or they dare not speak openly about the experience , because the shame is too great . &quot;
&quot; as they often don &apos;t know how to help , more accommodations only require for them , requiring B@@ ahr . &quot;
&quot; in Bavaria , the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees . &quot;
&quot; on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction , some respond with no . &quot;
&quot; in the Upper Pal@@ at@@ inate and Upper Fran@@ con@@ ia , for example , there is no such thing in shel@@ ters of the governments . &quot;
&quot; even in Sw@@ ab@@ ia alone , wing@@ ed women are not accommodated separately , says Karl @-@ Heinz Meyer , press spokesperson for the government . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Bavaria , Lower and Central Fran@@ con@@ ia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children . &quot;
&quot; the exception is Lower Bavaria , there are two central accommodations exclusively for women . &quot;
&quot; the committee &quot; &quot; Rights of Women and Gender E@@ quality &quot; &quot; in the European Parliament calls for women to be lod@@ ged separately by men . &quot;
&quot; in a study published for the committee , it says : &quot; it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately . &quot;
&quot; if privacy is missing or if men and women are accommodated together , there can be - perpet@@ ual - violence against women . &quot;
&quot; above all , the wash@@ rooms should be separate and accessible to women , it is in the study . &quot;
&quot; how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush , which there is on the house in Munich . &quot;
&quot; since it has been around for us , we have a long waiting list , &quot; &quot; says B@@ ahr . &quot;
one could easily open a second house .
assistant doctors argue : demands for new labor camp measures
assistant physicians have called for their union to appro@@ ve new employment campaigns in their disputes regarding a new contract .
the Junior Doc@@ tors Committee ( J@@ DC ) of the British Medical Association ( BM@@ A ) has called for its entire Council to appro@@ ve more work combat measures from the beginning of September .
the J@@ DC said that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns of the contract .
&quot; in July , assistance and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BM@@ A . &quot;
he was rejected by 58 % of his members voted in the elections .
&quot; in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening , the Chairman of the J@@ DC Ellen Mc@@ Court said that the government would have remained &quot; stub@@ bor@@ n@@ ly &quot; to problems , which led to the treaty being rejected . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; considering this , the J@@ DC Bureau has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and challenge official negotiations on all your concerns . &quot;
&quot; as an answer to the government &apos;s silence , the J@@ DC Executive Board today put a formal request for a special meeting of the BM@@ A Council to appro@@ ve a running program of escal@@ ating labor fighting measures that begins at the beginning of September . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the con@@ ten@@ tions led to the fact that Assistant Doc@@ tors struck six times this year , the first total out@@ ages in the history of the N@@ HS . &quot;
&quot; the head of the BM@@ A Assistance Doc@@ tors , Dr. Johann Mal@@ aw@@ ana , res@@ igned after the election for the rejection of the agreed contract conditions recommended by the BM@@ A . &quot;
&quot; he shared the BM@@ A members during the meetings , which took place before the vote by 5@@ 4,000 veter@@ in@@ arians and medical students , with the fact that the agreement was beneficial and should be accepted . &quot;
&quot; following the vote , the Minister of Health , Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t , said that the contract for doctors in England would be forci@@ bly introduced . &quot;
Russia and Turkey : an &quot; alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; ?
it was a gesture that ended a crisis .
the leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight @-@ month war of words and economic sanctions .
&quot; but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gil@@ ded hall of the St. Petersburg palace , I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation . &quot;
&quot; there was a hand@@ shake , yes . &quot;
&quot; but Putin sm@@ iles broad@@ ly and he barely radi@@ ated warmth , even for his restra@@ ined conditions . &quot;
&quot; Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan , on the other hand , repeatedly spoke of his &quot; dear friend &quot; Putin - according to a report of all five times . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t count it any more .
&quot; he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis , but even to improve . &quot;
&quot; the next day , a newspaper described that Erdo@@ gan would have beha@@ ved as if there had never been anything worse . &quot;
to me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite .
&quot; but one of Putin em@@ bla@@ sted , sustainable cool showed that Russia &apos;s head of state had forgotten nothing . &quot;
&quot; rather , the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its introductory words : the down@@ shot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey . &quot;
Moscow &apos;s reaction to the time was fur@@ ious .
Putin shared Ankara and accused Ankara of falling into the backs of Russia .
the off@@ ence was even greater since it was perpet@@ rated by a supposed friend .
building up the un@@ cle will be difficult if not even impossible .
the public opinion in Russia has changed since November .
&quot; for months , the state controlled media triggered a violent , un@@ restricted attack on Ankara . &quot;
at one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything .
&quot; most serious were the accus@@ ations by senior officials that Erdo@@ gan &apos;s own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria , controlled by the so @-@ called Islamic State . &quot;
he has denied this v@@ ehem@@ ently .
&quot; but in St. Petersburg , the official message was that it was time to look forward . &quot;
&quot; finally , this meeting took place only because Putin was ap@@ ologi@@ zed by President Erdo@@ gan , whom he wanted to hear . &quot;
Russia could book a kind of victory .
&quot; for Ankara , the advantages of a cease @-@ fire are obvious . &quot;
&quot; Erdo@@ gan , first and foremost , needs all the friends he can get after finishing almost his office last month with a failed coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at . &quot;
repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also sha@@ ken it .
but there are also economic motives .
&quot; Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights , which every year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast . &quot;
the number has declined by almost 90 % .
&quot; in Russia , tour operators and charter companies will be reli@@ eved when flights are resum@@ ed . &quot;
they count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea .
&quot; this week , the state television projected cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agr@@ arian imports are allowed again . &quot;
&quot; a report in Ve@@ demo@@ sti formulated it as follows : &quot; &quot; tourists there long , tomatoes here long . &quot;
but the visit had an additional political value for Moscow .
&quot; Ankara is angry at the West , as it responds to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ongoing res@@ ent@@ ment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin &apos;s sn@@ ail speed is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey &apos;s relationship to the West . &quot;
&quot; the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for a bonus that , after the attempted coup d &apos;@@ et@@ at , demanded support for the elected state organs . &quot;
&quot; this is a matter of course for Moscow , which even has a deep @-@ seated fear of regime change . &quot;
&quot; the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present one , as an analy@@ st once described to me , &quot; &quot; Alliance of out@@ si@@ ders &quot; &quot; : two countries that feel rejected and badly treated by the West and are now allied . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in spite of the public reconciliation , there are still great differences between the two . &quot;
&quot; the biggest difference is Syria , where Moscow has recently played the role as a peac@@ em@@ akers , but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides . &quot;
&quot; it might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks , both pres@@ idents at the press conference said they did not even seize the subject . &quot;
&quot; the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences , while Putin decided to emphas@@ ise it . &quot;
there is no clear consensus on where a common denom@@ in@@ ator can be found in Syria .
&quot; but after months of open hos@@ ti@@ lities - and in the face of the potential for a complete disaster , when NATO member Turkey poured the Russian military jet , it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are talking at least once again . &quot;
Royal Bank of Scotland no longer available for customers outside Scotland
&quot; according to the Bank &apos;s CEO , R@@ BS should be reduced to a back office role . &quot;
the Royal Bank of Scotland will no longer be available to customers outside Scotland .
Ross Mc@@ E@@ wan told BBC Scotland that the R@@ BS brand was connected to the Bank &apos;s global ambi@@ tions .
&quot; since then , the bank has dist@@ anced itself from being almost collap@@ sed and saved eight years ago . &quot;
&quot; at this time , brand strate@@ gi@@ sts &quot; R@@ BS &quot; have used to protect other end @-@ consumer @-@ brands . &quot;
&quot; she supported the international sport with millions of pounds at sponsor@@ ing , from the Six Nations Ru@@ g@@ by to Wim@@ ble@@ don winner Andy Mur@@ ray . &quot;
but now she has decided to focus more national brands .
&quot; the Royal Bank of Scotland will only be available to customers in Scotland , but will not be initi@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; in England and Wales all RS@@ B references , the decentr@@ alised headquarters and the stock market record are to be changed to Nat@@ West . &quot;
the Ul@@ ster bench brand is already used for customers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland .
&quot; there are other smaller brands for the retail business that will be more important - C@@ out@@ ts , Adam &amp; Co , Dru@@ m@@ mond and Hol@@ t &apos;s Military Bank . &quot;
Mc@@ E@@ wan was inter@@ viewed during a sightseeing tour by customers and employees in In@@ ver@@ ness @-@ Shi@@ re .
&quot; he divided the BBC Scotland with : &quot; &quot; the brand RS@@ B will become our investor @-@ brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy , as we now become more to a bank of brands . &quot;
&quot; when the bank itself became a global brand , R@@ BS became a global brand . &quot;
&quot; I say now that we do not pursue global goals , but local objectives . &quot;
each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands .
R@@ BS has already stated that it will no longer carry out its Six Nations sponsor@@ ing and that it will increase the percep@@ ti@@ bility of the different brands in its sport sponsorship .
&quot; it &apos;s time for us to develop to the bank of the brands , because how do we concentrate inside ( we asked ) to make this a better bank for customers ? &quot; said the Chairman of the board . &quot;
&quot; it would have been very cy@@ ni@@ cal three years ago , if we said that we would be a great bank for our customers and launched these brands . &quot;
&quot; but with our work , the focus on customer needs and not our own , I think , you will see many changes . &quot;
&quot; we can launch these trademarks again , so I think the time has come . &quot;
&quot; Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori reaches its 3,@@ 000@@ th gain at New@@ market on Pre@@ dile@@ ction &quot;
&quot; D@@ ett@@ ori spra@@ ys champagne after a double at New@@ market , which gives him 3,@@ 000@@ th win &quot;
&quot; the Jo@@ ckey Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori secured his 3,@@ 000@@ th British profit on Friday at New@@ market . &quot;
&quot; he set a milestone on Pre@@ dile@@ ction , which is trained by John Gos@@ den , on his local rac@@ et@@ rack with his second win of the night . &quot;
&quot; the 45 @-@ year @-@ old Italian is the sixth jo@@ ckey , who reached the milestone in the flat race . &quot;
&quot; he follows Sir Gordon Rich@@ ards , Dou@@ g Smith , L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , P@@ at Ed@@ dry and Wil@@ lie Car@@ son . &quot;
&quot; the three @-@ time winner D@@ ett@@ ori , who won in front of G@@ ha@@ y@@ y@@ ar , said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s something special . &quot;
I am very emotional because my family is here too
&quot; I am very happy that it happened at New@@ market , because I landed here 30 years ago . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s not a big meeting , it &apos;s not Royal As@@ cot - it &apos;s a ban@@ al Friday night with 20,000 people . &quot;
I am reli@@ eved and very modest .
D@@ ett@@ ori picks up the che@@ er when he reco@@ vers from Pre@@ dile@@ ction
&quot; two jo@@ ck@@ eys reached the milestone in the obstacle race - Jo@@ ckey Richard Johnson and retired 20 @-@ time winner Sir Anthony Mc@@ Co@@ y , who scored more than 4,@@ 300 victories in a record breaking career . &quot;
&quot; L@@ ester Pig@@ got@@ t , the nine @-@ time Der@@ b@@ ysi@@ eger had 4,@@ 4@@ 93 career gir@@ ders &quot;
Frank@@ ie is one of the best jo@@ ckey of Moder@@ nis@@ m and it &apos;s no surprise that he reached this milestone that only a few have reached before him .
&quot; he has style and is strong , but it is his tac@@ tical intel@@ lect , which differenti@@ ates him from the others in the weight control room . &quot;
&quot; he is a fantastic ambassador for racing , his enthusiasm and char@@ isma fans have been enthusiastic about this sport for years . &quot;
&quot; I said Frank@@ ie a few weeks ago at Ep@@ som , that he had already scored 6,000 gains if he wasn &apos;t just a weekend and big tournament jo@@ ckey ! &quot;
Frank@@ ie has already suffered 30 years of winning players in the UK which is great .
&quot; he has a living personality , which is good for a British race , but in addition he is an incredible jo@@ ckey . &quot;
Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori celebrated the milestone with a typical Flying Dis@@ mount
&quot; from Flying Fin@@ ishes to Flying Dis@@ moun@@ ts , Frank@@ ie D@@ ett@@ ori has been the flagship of the British flat race for two decades . &quot;
it was nerve wre@@ cking .
&quot; a whole series of major tournaments , including his famous &quot; Gl@@ orious Si@@ eben &quot; in As@@ cot , in 1996 , but he also survived a plane crash and received a prohibition of drugs . &quot;
&quot; three years ago , he had difficulties when he returned from his six months lock , but he showed an impressive characteristic strength to def@@ y his doubts and to return to his best form . &quot;
and he is not yet at the end - D@@ ett@@ ori once said that he wants to continue in competitions up to at least 5@@ 0.@@ ten years of age .
Russian Putin damp@@ ens Chief of Staff Serge@@ y Ivan@@ ov
Russian President Vladimir Putin has un@@ expect@@ edly dismissed his staff of staff Sergei Ivan@@ ov .
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V was part of the tigh@@ test confidence circle of Putin for many years .
the 63 @-@ year @-@ old was appointed Special Represent@@ ative for Environmental and Transport Affairs .
&quot; in a statement of the Krem@@ lin it reads , that without stating reasons , Putin had ordered the discharge of Ivan@@ ov from his duties as the chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration . &quot;
&quot; Anton V@@ ain@@ o , who has been his deputy since 2012 , has been appointed his successor . &quot;
&quot; V@@ ain@@ o , 44 , is a former diplom@@ at . &quot;
&quot; born in the Est@@ onian capital of Tall@@ inn in 1972 , he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations ( M@@ G@@ IMO ) and worked in the Tokyo embassy . &quot;
&quot; on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , it is called ( in Russian ) that he later became the chief executive director and chief executive officer . &quot;
&quot; on his appointment , he said to Putin , &quot; &quot; Thank you for your confidence . &quot; &quot; &quot;
I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state in regard to bills of law and controls to implement your instructions .
Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivan@@ ov asked to leave his post and recommended V@@ ain@@ o as his successor .
convince the smiling faces ?
this step has made Moscow mysterious .
&quot; Sergei Ivan@@ ov was one of Vladimir Putin &apos;s closest friends for a long time , working as he for the Soviet intelligence service , the K@@ GB . &quot;
&quot; as Chief of Staff , he was one of the most powerful men in the country . &quot;
&quot; at a meeting with President Putin on television broad@@ cast@@ ed , both men claimed that the Chief of Staff res@@ igned on his own request . &quot;
&quot; but despite the smile for the cameras , only a few of them are convinced - especially now , just before the parliamentary elections . &quot;
so here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle ?
nobody knows this at this time .
&quot; but the official asser@@ tion - that a man , once tou@@ ted as a potential president , would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great skep@@ ticism . &quot;
&quot; in his remarks to Putin , quoted on the Krem@@ lin &apos;s website , Ivan@@ ov said , &quot; &quot; It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to put on a complaint for four years . &quot;
&quot; as it turns out , I have been chairman of the Russian Pres@@ idential Administration for four years and eight months . &quot;
IV@@ AN@@ O@@ V took the post in December 2011 .
&quot; prior to that , he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence . &quot;
he is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin ex @-@ member of the State Security Service K@@ GB .
&quot; in the late 1990s , when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service ( FS@@ B ) , who replaced the K@@ GB , Ivan@@ ov was appointed his deputy . &quot;
&quot; when Putin came to power , he called Ivan@@ ov as one of five people whom he trusted most . &quot;
&quot; once it was believed that after Putin &apos;s second term of office , Ivan@@ ov could become president of Russia , since a third term of Putin had viol@@ ated the constitution . &quot;
&quot; but this post was taken by another , close allies of Putin , D@@ mit@@ ry Med@@ ve@@ dev . &quot;
Putin became Prime Minister before becoming president three and a half years later .
criminal Min@@ ds Star Thomas Gib@@ son fired after he hit producers
Gib@@ son was involved in a physical examination on the set of the series in Los Angeles last month .
ABC Studios and C@@ BS Television Studios that produce the series announced their termination in a joint statement .
&quot; Gib@@ son , who played the Special Agent Aaron Hot@@ chner , ap@@ ologi@@ zed on Thursday before the announcement of his dis@@ mis@@ sal . &quot;
on the set there was artistic differences and a dis@@ agreement .
&quot; I regret the incident , &quot; &quot; he said in a message . &quot;
&quot; details about how the character Gib@@ sons from the series , which follows a team of FBI agents , is expected to be released at a later date , according to the opinion of ABC studios and C@@ BS Television Studios . &quot;
&quot; the 54 @-@ year @-@ old , who previously played in Sit@@ com Dhar@@ ma &amp; Gre@@ g , has been with us since the first season of the series in 2005 . &quot;
&quot; I love Criminal Min@@ ds and plu@@ gged down my entire heart blood for the last twelve years , &quot; said Gib@@ son in a message published on Friday . &quot;
&quot; I had hoped to be there until the end , but it will not be possible anymore . &quot;
&quot; I would like to say thank you to the authors , producers , actors , our wonderful crew and especially the best fans you could wish for a series . &quot;
the planned char@@ isma of the twel@@ fth season is scheduled for September 28 .
ri@@ ddle around fish that landed in the garden in Ban@@ ff
one of the inhabitants of Ban@@ ff called for help in the identification of the fish that appeared in his garden in Ban@@ ff .
Kevin B@@ ain thinks it could deal with the 75 fish around Sand@@ a@@ ale that were mirr@@ ored by a fountain .
&quot; Mr. B@@ ain , who lives about 500 meters from the sea , published a video of the spectacle on Per@@ is@@ cope in the hope that someone could shed some light on the appearance of the two inches long fish . &quot;
Que@@ ens@@ ferry Crossing : bridge connected with Fi@@ fe
the budget of the £ 1.@@ 35 billion will be completed by May 2017
&quot; engineers connected the north deck of the Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings with the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct , which means that the bridge is now connected to Fi@@ fe . &quot;
&quot; it is the first of four closures of the &quot; &quot; Deck@@ b@@ lower &quot; , &quot; which will approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; the bridge section of Fi@@ fe is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons . &quot;
&quot; it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 obli@@ que ropes . &quot;
the budget of £ 1.@@ 35 billion will be completed by May 2017 .
Minister Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; This is a historic and symbolic moment when you build Que@@ ens@@ ferry cross@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge . &quot;
&quot; despite the massive size and weight of the bridge , completion of the connection between the vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct and the bridge deck is a tricky job that requires extremely precise toler@@ ances for fit . &quot;
&quot; all in all , almost 79 % of the total bridge deck is in its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete flow in Ros@@ y@@ th , which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge . &quot;
&quot; Michael Martin , Project Manager of For@@ th Crossing Bridge Con@@ struc@@ tors said : &quot; the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project . &quot;
&quot; with this fantastic project , the closure is a forward @-@ looking high and low construction . &quot;
&quot; after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north , we had to close the existing gap between the north and the north . &quot;
this was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 milli@@ meters south .
this was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity .
&quot; massive because the Vi@@ ad@@ u@@ ct is 2@@ 22 meters long , weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incl@@ ine of about 3 % . &quot;
&quot; as the toler@@ ances on which the team were working , they were tiny - on each side they only fertili@@ zed a few milli@@ metres . &quot;
fortunately everything went very well .
rescue in the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay : three men have &quot; happiness &quot; still alive
&quot; three men have &quot; &quot; luck still alive &quot; &quot; after being thrown from their fishing boat in front of Angl@@ es@@ ey . &quot;
the Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re R@@ N@@ LI rescue station sounded alarm on Friday at 13 : 20 BS@@ T Alarm after a crew observed the event in Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Bay .
the three men had difficulty floating in safety while their boat moved on from their own power .
&quot; we saw the boat rolling in its proximity and introduced us to the worst , &quot; &quot; said the head of the rescue station of Mo@@ el@@ f@@ re Vin@@ ce Jones . &quot;
&quot; fortunately the strong winds have already blown the boat out of their reach , until we left water , &quot; he added . &quot;
&quot; two of the men were rescu@@ ed by a local fishing boat , while the third man was exhausted at the age of 60 and was found hanging on a bu@@ o@@ y without a life@@ jacket . &quot;
they all came aboard the coastal rescue boat and were brought back to the rescue station .
&quot; Mr Jones said , &quot; &quot; The three men who were thrown into the water have been un@@ har@@ med and still alive . &quot;
&quot; the boat engine had a emergency stop , however , it loos@@ ened , however , when the boat came from the person who ste@@ ered the boat . &quot;
someone has guarded these men today .
seriously injured - man is sti@@ cking to his ex @-@ girlfriend
a man attacked and severely injured his ex @-@ girlfriend in Hamburg @-@ Har@@ burg with a knife .
&quot; as the police said yesterday , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old got the key to the apartment to get his personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; instead , the alcoholic perpetr@@ ator cut the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; when she came into the apartment , he stab@@ bed it twice . &quot;
the 44 year old was injured by the hand and the body .
the police could arrest the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; while the 50 @-@ year @-@ old destroyed the clothes of his ex @-@ girlfriend , he called his mother . &quot;
this then al@@ er@@ ted his sister .
&quot; together with her partner , the 45 @-@ year @-@ old wanted to calm her brother . &quot;
but she could not move him to leave the apartment .
that is why she went out of the house with her companion .
on the road they met the ex @-@ partner of the man .
&quot; when the two women entered the apartment again , the 50 @-@ year @-@ old st@@ ole his sister to the side and attacked his ex @-@ girlfriend . &quot;
who builds Braunschweig &apos;s cheap apartments ?
the SPD and the Gre@@ ens mean : investors should be put into duty more strongly in future .
how do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 budget apartments over the next few years ?
the SPD will propose a &quot; concept of action &quot; at the next council meeting .
but dispute is programmed .
first and foremost it &apos;s about the question : who should build the cheap apartments actually ?
a regulation is missing until now .
&quot; the SPD leader , Christoph Brat@@ mann , says : &quot; &quot; we agree with the Gre@@ ens : whoever wants to build on urban areas will have to report 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future . &quot;
&quot; however , the cheap apartments can also be built in the continu@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; however , the big conflict in the town hall is , &quot; said Brat@@ mann , &quot; How do you deal with investors who want to build on private planes ? &quot;
&quot; we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas , but build as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing . &quot;
&quot; a new urban housing construction supporting programme , which will cost millions and needs to be financed , should provide incentives for incentives . &quot;
&quot; the problem , said Brat@@ mann : &quot; there is no agreement between the fac@@ tions at the moment . &quot;
the CD@@ U wants to make investors as few as possible .
the left wants to make even harder print runs for investors .
&quot; despite this , such as Brat@@ mann , there is a sharpen@@ ing of the situation in the housing market . &quot;
&quot; if the action plan is implemented , it will take care of additional tasks in the construction management . &quot;
more staff is required .
it is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers .
&quot; but the programme is not yet complete : the approximately 12@@ 60 new apartments , which should be built anyway . &quot;
&quot; but how do you balance the loss of some 1,@@ 300 cheap apartments , whose funding will exp@@ ire over the next few years ? &quot;
&quot; by 2020 alone , there will be 500 apartments . &quot;
&quot; to prevent this , according to the planning policy spokes@@ woman Nicole palm , the city should now be purchased from the city . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would have to be re@@ thought of bringing apartments back into the price binding . &quot;
this is possible in the western city .
&quot; at one stroke , the problem could be solved . &quot;
&quot; because in the west city , the year @-@ ends meet deadlines . &quot;
around 1800 apartments could be retri@@ eved from there back into the price binding for cheap apartments .
&quot; only : they do not want the owners , the housing associations . &quot;
this is because the number of social housing in the west city is increased dramatically from the goal of so @-@ called mixing .
there should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city .
the Gre@@ ens reck@@ on that there will be some movement in the discussion .
&quot; said S &amp; D vice @-@ president Holger Her@@ lit@@ sch@@ ke : &quot; &quot; for a large majority , the CD@@ U must go into the boat . &quot;
&quot; indeed , I have concentrated on more building sites for single @-@ family homes . &quot;
but what does not mean that a compromise is not yet to be found .
&quot; Pok@@ é@@ mon Go , a hunt for health and happiness that pays off &quot;
it is fascinating to see how the world changes .
&quot; the fact that teenagers and children are no longer going to play outside , but rather prefer to spend their leisure time sitting on screens , has been lam@@ ented by many in the last decade . &quot;
Pok@@ emon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active .
&quot; the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV , then on video games and last on smartphones . &quot;
&quot; therefore , it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other . &quot;
&quot; of course I refer to Pok@@ é@@ mon Go @-@ W@@ ahn , an app that is based on the characters created for the video games in the 199@@ 0@@ ies ( later created a cartoon series , playing cards and other spin @-@ offs ) . &quot;
&quot; how many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest before publishing the game in the USA , Australia and New Zealand in early July . &quot;
the market launch in other countries has been postpon@@ ed by the massive demand that over@@ loads the servers .
&quot; within a few days , Pok@@ é@@ mon Go had more users than Tin@@ der and almost as many as Twitter . &quot;
how does it work ?
&quot; in short , players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pok@@ emon which are tra@@ cked with a GPS and once they were found &quot; photographed &quot; ( via a screen@@ shot on the phone ) or &quot; captured . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a generation that played the game when she was younger , joined the track and jumped for the search of the sofa . &quot;
&quot; in the US , the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the &quot; average &quot; person returns every day . &quot;
&quot; Cardi@@ ogram , an app for Apple Watch , which pursu@@ es 35@@ ,000 users , the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of launching the game , the number of follow @-@ up people who train every day 30 minutes , from 45 percent to 53 percent . &quot;
the company does not know who plays this Pok@@ é@@ mon Go - it merely looks for raw data to increase performance .
&quot; many public awareness campaigns on the health that people want to take &quot; &quot; 30 minutes of time &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; coming from the sofa &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; being active every day &quot; &quot; on deaf ears , because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look mis@@ erable . &quot;
&quot; however , the importance of sport cannot be over@@ valued . &quot;
&quot; who regularly pursu@@ es sports , reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression . &quot;
&quot; physical activity helps in weight control , high blood pressure , diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here . &quot;
but the miracle of Pok@@ é@@ mon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun .
&quot; thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise , fresh air and sunshine as well as fun . &quot;
some people even close new friend@@ ships when hunting .
&quot; as always , there are also gru@@ mp@@ y game @-@ destro@@ yers , who always have to complain about something . &quot;
&quot; and yes , someone could walk against a door . &quot;
what is it supposed to ?
a breakthrough has occurred .
&quot; even if smartphone apps like Fit@@ bit have already been able to track our activity earlier , they didn &apos;t give us a reason to do sports as it does this game . &quot;
the new will lose its appeal and the use will be recre@@ ated over time .
&quot; however , due to poker &apos;s success , there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active , more active and healthier . &quot;

Simone Bil@@ es creates gold in the Dam@@ ur@@ ur@@ nen
forget the print .
forget the hyp@@ e .
Simone Bil@@ es is immune to all this .
dynamic on the jumping horse .
effort@@ less on the beam .
breathtaking on the ground .
brilliant on a whole line .
and now finally the Olympic Champion .
the 19 @-@ year @-@ old American gymn@@ ast er@@ kl@@ om@@ m on Thursday became a multi @-@ campaign title and enlarged the gap between himself and the rest of the world before all eyes under the spotlight of the Olympic Games .
&quot; their overall result of 6@@ 2,@@ 19@@ 8 was clearly ahead of the silver med@@ alli@@ sts and &quot; Final Five &quot; team mates , A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man and the Russian bronze medal winner in Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ ina . &quot;
&quot; the American woman Simone Bil@@ es is on the floating beam during the single multi @-@ campaign of women at the gymn@@ astic tournaments in Rio de Janeiro 2016 , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es is the fourth h@@ eter@@ osexual American who wins a multi @-@ campaign title and in total the fifth , while she consoli@@ dates her call to be the best of her generation or even at all . &quot;
she burst into tears as her final result was shown and her long journey at that moment ended .
&quot; this success puts them in the same league as unique athletes like Michael P@@ helps , who brought their sports to new heights : &quot;
&quot; it has dominated the last three years , 15 world champi@@ onships , including 10 gold medals , which include a mixture of ambition and precision that the Olympic champion of 1984 Mary Lo@@ u rescue on from her said that she is the best gymn@@ ast I &apos;ve ever seen . &quot;
&quot; she expected her last test in Brazil , a competition that didn &apos;t go so much between Bil@@ es and the rest of the athletes , but rather between her and a load of over@@ sized expectations . &quot;
&quot; not returning with a handful of gold back to the family in Spring , Texas would be regarded as disappointment . &quot;
&quot; the American women Simone Bil@@ es , left , and A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man embrace each other after winning gold and silver in the single multi @-@ campaign of women in the gymn@@ astic tournaments in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Bil@@ es took the first medal on Tuesday , while at the farewell party of the retired team coordinator Martha Kar@@ oly@@ i served as a clamation mark . &quot;
&quot; although Bil@@ es insi@@ sted , during her long journey to the top never to have planned the future , this is not really true . &quot;
part of their soil exercises - which contain their typical Tum@@ bling Pass - is tuned to Latin American music that would fit at home on the street outside the Olympic arena in Rio .
this is not accidental .
&quot; this girl , who was adopted by her grand@@ parents as a small child and was discovered by trainer A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man &apos;s mother during a school excursion into the gymn@@ asi@@ um in which Bo@@ or@@ man was trained , became a force . &quot;
&quot; since the summer of 2013 , it has lost no more competition competition , a winning stre@@ ak that will continue as long as it wishes . &quot;
&quot; even if Mu@@ staf@@ a slightly led through two turns , the picture was dec@@ ep@@ tive . &quot;
floating beams and ground dunes - in which Bil@@ es holds the title of the world title - l@@ ur@@ ned .
&quot; she picked up again with 15,@@ 4@@ 33 on the floating beam - and with a 15,@@ 9@@ 33 on the floor still one on it . &quot;
&quot; Ra@@ is@@ man embra@@ ced her gently as she expected her final b@@ nis - a pure form@@ ality - and tears flow@@ ed to Bil@@ es bril@@ li@@ antly red , white and blue eyel@@ iner , as the vision she once described in her book book , became a reality . &quot;
&quot; the performance Ra@@ is@@ mans was a revenge for the last time four years ago when she fought for third place , but the bronze medal went to Mu@@ staf@@ a in a Ti@@ eb@@ ra@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; this time , the 22 @-@ year @-@ old team of men , which is called &quot; &quot; Grand@@ ma &quot; &quot; by the Americans , had a lead . &quot;
&quot; after her ground exercise she threw the audience to the crowd , overwhel@@ med by a com@@ eback , which sometimes seemed dou@@ bt@@ ful . &quot;
&quot; as for Bil@@ es , the rapidly spreading T@@ we@@ et of 19 @-@ year @-@ olds has a whole new meaning from the beginning of this week : &quot;
police : 3 victims killed in mass mur@@ der@@ ous kill@@ ings in the car
&quot; according to police reports published on Thursday , two women and a 12 @-@ year @-@ old girl were shot , killed in one of the dead@@ liest attacks since a decade in the first mass mur@@ der@@ ous hit by Phoenix , while they chat@@ ted in the car and listened to music . &quot;
&quot; Angela Rochelle Liner , Stef@@ anie R. El@@ lis and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah were shot on June 12 , while the car was par@@ ked in a dri@@ ve@@ way , the authorities said . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator fired eight shots from a hand fire@@ arm , while standing on the passenger side of the car and fled afterwards with another vehicle , is to be read in the report . &quot;
&quot; the police said that the triple murder would not have been the result of a rob@@ ber@@ y , as the attack@@ er did not take the hand@@ bags or the $ 2,@@ 900 who were in possession of one of the adult victims . &quot;
the police spokes@@ man of Phoenix S@@ g@@ t. Jonathan Howard said that the shooting led the investig@@ ators to see if they were connected with four previous attacks .
&quot; in total , seven people were killed in the His@@ panic neighbour@@ hoods within four months , and two others were injured . &quot;
&quot; it happens in a residential area in front of a house , &quot; said Howard der K@@ H@@ PO , a subsidiary of C@@ BS , at the beginning of the month . &quot;
&quot; it is assumed that the susp@@ ects used several vehicles , including a brown N@@ iss@@ an from the late 1990s , a black BMW from the late 1990s and a white Cadi@@ l@@ lac or Lincol@@ n . &quot;
the investig@@ ators refused to disclose the evidence that they had led to the conclusion that the attacks were linked and committed by the same mur@@ derer .
&quot; El@@ lis , 33 , was hospit@@ alized due to her injuries and died later . &quot;
&quot; liner , 31 , and El@@ lis daughter Mal@@ e@@ ah died on site . &quot;
a witness told the police that it was not unusual for them to sit in a par@@ ked car and listen to music .
&quot; the authorities also published a police report on the shooting , which went on an empty pick@@ up truck half an hour before the triple murder , and from that it was assumed that it was the work of serial killer . &quot;
investig@@ ators found bul@@ let sleeves and secured a ball from the seat as well as ball fragments from the engine compartment .
&quot; mother of a 6 @-@ year @-@ old with micro@@ cephal@@ y : &quot; &quot; it becomes better &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; like most 6 @-@ year @-@ old Ed@@ mund Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to loves singing , toys and of course his mother . &quot;
&quot; but just like the least of his old friends Ed@@ mund &apos;s micro@@ cephal@@ y , the result of a genetic disorder , about which his mother Elizabeth Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to knew nothing during her pregnancy . &quot;
&quot; when he first came home , my first thought was , I couldn &apos;t do that . &quot;
I don &apos;t manage that .
I did not let myself down .
&quot; what is not true at all -- of course , you have settled on it , &quot; she said . &quot;
her husband Vincent and her husband Vincent told her that Ed@@ mund may never be able to recognize her and that he may not even survive .
some doctors even went so far that they proposed to institution@@ alise it .
&quot; my first answer was &apos; I didn &apos;t know that people still do &apos; , &apos; Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to said . &quot;
Ed@@ mund may run with the help of a subsi@@ dy .
Ed@@ mund could neither sit nor craw@@ l up until his third year of life and he still cannot speak .
but he is making progress slowly .
it can run with support and cycle .
he also loves to play and sing with his two brothers .
Elizabeth shows the sign of the sign that Ed@@ mund chose for &quot; Please sing me a little before . &quot;
&quot; we teach him a sign language , &quot; &quot; told Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to C@@ BS News . &quot;
but it is not a typical sign language -- says it . Ed@@ mund invented some characters on their own .
micro@@ cephal@@ y has a variety of causes : genetic as with Ed@@ mund and infections with viruses such as meas@@ les or the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus during pregnancy .
the symptoms and forecasts can vary greatly .
it is still too early to tell how it will affect the life of the infected with the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus infected .
Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to re@@ members the emotional price of an uncertain future .
&quot; I asked all the time , what will happen ? &quot;
what will happen ?
and she still doesn &apos;t know .
&quot; I haven &apos;t asked for the pro@@ g@@ nosis for a long time , because I don &apos;t expect it to really tell me someone . &quot;
but Pic@@ ci@@ u@@ to has a hop@@ eful advice for mothers of infants with birth defects caused by the Zi@@ k@@ avi@@ rus .
it will be better .
they know that it will be better for you .
you will love your child and your child will love you .
&quot; heavy rainf@@ all , floo@@ ding gives rise to b@@ ail@@ outs in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi &quot;
heavy rainf@@ all and large @-@ scale floo@@ ding in Lou@@ isi@@ ana forced the governor to call on the emergency on Friday .
&quot; numerous rivers in the south east of Lou@@ isi@@ ana and the south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi flood their banks and threatened with large @-@ scale floo@@ ding after extreme rainf@@ alls , the National weather service reported . &quot;
the Gover@@ nor of Lou@@ isi@@ ana John B@@ el Edwards announced that state officials are in constant contact with the local authorities and are already on their way to the affected communities .
&quot; Mike Ste@@ ele , a spokes@@ man for the Office of Hom@@ eland Security and Emer@@ gency Pre@@ par@@ edness of the Gover@@ nor , announced that the requests for flood vehicles , boats and sand@@ bags increased . &quot;
Ste@@ ele said that only the commune of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa had requested ten thousand sand@@ bags .
a flood warning system is used over large parts in south Lou@@ isi@@ ana to Saturday .
the weather service announced that additional 3 to 5 inches of rain could fall in this area .
&quot; in the south of Al@@ ab@@ ama , a flood warning system was used on Friday , while it still ra@@ ined in the mobile area . &quot;
&quot; the river Com@@ ite near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ges and the Am@@ ite river near Den@@ ham Springs , both of which are located in Lou@@ isi@@ ana , will likely reach record levels across the weekend . &quot;
met@@ er@@ e@@ ologist Ale@@ k K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann says that both rivers could flooded many houses in the suburbs near Bat@@ on Rou@@ ge .
&quot; he also said that a flood @-@ directed floo@@ ding in Ascension Par@@ ish represents a danger , as these rivers only slowly flow into Lake Mau@@ rep@@ as over the assigned rivers . &quot;
&quot; the river Ti@@ ck@@ fa@@ w , south of the Miss@@ issi@@ ppi state border in Liverpool , Lou@@ isi@@ ana , reached the highest level ever recorded on Friday at 09.@@ 00 . &quot;
rescue teams still sli@@ pped people out of flood water in the districts of Am@@ ite and Wil@@ kin@@ son in the south @-@ west of Miss@@ issi@@ ppi .
&quot; L@@ ero@@ y Hans@@ ford , his wife and his step@@ son were among those saved by Glo@@ ster on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford , 62 , says that water from Be@@ aver Creek , which is normally located more than 400 feet away from his house , rose strongly overnight . &quot;
he said that another step@@ son who lives nearby would have warned him .
&quot; we woke up and the water flow@@ ed and poured in , &quot; &quot; said Hans@@ ford . &quot;
it reached my waist .
&quot; his wife , Hans@@ ford said that she had never seen such a high level of the river in the 48 years she lived there . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said he and his family members had all the disabilities , and he would be the only one who can swim . &quot;
&quot; Hans@@ ford said that emergency hel@@ pers had saved all three in a big military truck , and brought them to the next fire station in Glo@@ ster , where they were accommodated until Friday . &quot;
&quot; K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the flood had spread quickly , as there were heavy rainf@@ all and that the authorities should take into account evacu@@ ation instructions . &quot;
&quot; according to K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann , an observer in the proximity of Liv@@ ing@@ stone reported from midnight to Friday morning of 13.@@ 75 inches of rain . &quot;
K@@ rau@@ t@@ mann said that the ground had been considerably su@@ cked by the rainf@@ alls since Wednesday .
the authorities stated that heavy rainf@@ all and street floods caused the rescue of inhabitants from their homes in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa Par@@ ish and teaching staff in five school districts .
&quot; the WW@@ L C@@ BS affiliate reported that an or@@ derly , in Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , attacked 200 flooded houses . &quot;
the inhabitants were evacu@@ ated in two churches that were now both flooded .
&quot; the ruler of Rob@@ by Miller said that the authorities had rescu@@ ed 72 people and seven pets , which were r@@ ins@@ ed by the flood . &quot;
&quot; in the cities of Am@@ ite and Ham@@ mond , emergency shel@@ ters were built to accommodate the evacu@@ ees . &quot;
&quot; once the water starts to go back , they will be able to go back to their homes , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in Ham@@ mond of the community of Tan@@ gi@@ p@@ ah@@ oa , almost two dozens of streets were closed due to the flood and sand@@ bags were provided for the residents , who hope to keep the water out of their homes and stores . &quot;
&quot; the last major flood we had was in March , &quot; &quot; L@@ acy Land@@ rum said about the city administration . &quot;
this seems to be a similar incident .
&quot; in Miss@@ issi@@ pp , the Emer@@ gency Manager of Ru@@ pert L@@ acy of the Har@@ rison Count@@ ys said that it still ra@@ ined on the Gulf Coast . &quot;
&quot; according to his statements , a handful of homes on Thursday should have been reported as flooded , but no reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; Keith T@@ own@@ son , Manager at Shop@@ per Value F@@ oods in Am@@ ite , has been living in the area for 40 years . &quot;
&quot; I have seen water in places I &apos;ve never seen before , &quot; &quot; said T@@ own@@ son , &quot; &quot; and it still comes . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown , 6 , &quot; bul@@ lied by bul@@ lets , &quot; survi@@ ves shooting in Philadelphia &quot;
the police announced that the 6 @-@ year @-@ old boy was shot in Philadelphia this week already the second time a 6 @-@ year @-@ old child was shot .
the grand@@ parents of the boy identified him as Ma@@ ha@@ j Brown for C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; grand@@ parents announced that Brown suffered multiple shot injuries including in the lum@@ bar , leg , arm and stomach , but that he was in the hospital at his transport to hospital . &quot;
&quot; he has done a lot , his small body was pun@@ ched by bul@@ lets , &quot; &quot; told his grandmother Del@@ ores Mel@@ ende@@ z to the station . &quot;
I can &apos;t believe it simply .
the state of the boy was considered critical in a hospital and he had to undergo several operations .
the boy family told the station that he is expected to recover .
he should have started the first class in a local primary school .
brown was one of four people who were shot in German@@ town .
three men were also shot : two at the age of 29 and a 32 @-@ year @-@ old .
one of the 29 @-@ year @-@ old men is in critical condition ; the other two victims are in a stable state according to C@@ BS Philadelphia .
&quot; the boy was found on the front seat of a car , together with the 29 @-@ year @-@ old who found himself in a critical condition , reports the station . &quot;
the other two victims were not in the car and the police were investigating whether one of the injured men could be the perpetr@@ ator .
&quot; investig@@ ators divided C@@ BS Philadelphia with , apparently , that it seemed to be a cross@@ fire between several sho@@ ot@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; cartridge sleeves for assault rif@@ les , which were tra@@ cked back to various storm @-@ guns , ski@@ pped the scene . &quot;
it seems that this is clearly an ongoing struggle .
&quot; on the street , on both sides of the path , were seals . &quot;
&quot; in this way , there seems to be several armed comb@@ at@@ ants who were very actively involved , &quot; &quot; said police cut@@ ters Anthony Gin@@ al@@ di of the police in Philadelphia to the station . &quot;
there were also several houses and vehicles in the area .
&quot; there was no arrest , and the police are currently re@@ viewing the surveillance video . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , another 6 @-@ year @-@ old girl was hit by a qu@@ atri@@ cian on her arm when she played in front of her house in the residential area of West O@@ ak Lane . &quot;
she reco@@ vers and the police are still looking for a suspect .
&quot; why we need Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie &quot;
that is what I imagine at the Women &apos;s Olympics in Tur@@ ning and that for more than one reason .
&quot; first , I have been part of every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant . &quot;
&quot; second : this team has three gymn@@ asts , Simone Bil@@ es , Gab@@ by Douglas and Lau@@ ren &quot; Lau@@ rie &quot; Her@@ nan@@ dez , which inspired many young girls of other skin color . &quot;
&quot; the structure of this team , the A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man , the Jew and Ma@@ dison Ko@@ cian , who is Catho@@ lics , makes everyone proud . &quot;
this team finally reflects the USA .
it has soli@@ di@@ fied the black and h@@ is@@ panic female presence at the top of this sport .
&quot; in the last four years , the number one among female gymn@@ asts was an A@@ fr@@ o @-@ American . &quot;
last year Simone and Gab@@ by were # 1 and # 2 .
this shows strength .
&quot; at the last Olympic Games , Gab@@ by Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America che@@ ered . &quot;
&quot; now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Bil@@ es , Douglas and Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , as they did unexpected but master@@ ly Gy@@ mascul@@ ine routines . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Simone was the fourth , h@@ eter@@ osexual American who won gold at an individual multi @-@ campaign event . &quot;
team member A@@ ly Ra@@ is@@ man won silver .
&quot; we experience the top of this sport , but we do not see sports classes in the whole country . &quot;
Simone and Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie all beat the same way as A@@ ly and Ma@@ dison to make it into the Olympic team .
&quot; they are the &quot; Last Five &quot; because the next Olympic team will have only four teams in the team . in addition , this is the last year with Mart@@ a Kar@@ oly@@ i as a trainer . &quot;
&quot; but the reality looks like gymn@@ as@@ tics are an expensive sport and Tur@@ ner primarily in private turn@@ tables , which are maintained by parents who pay for training , orientation , travel , competitive and hotel costs ( for the trainers and their families and families ) . &quot;
the majority of this turn@@ out lie in aff@@ lu@@ ent suburbs that can support the business .
&quot; in these clubs , the Tur@@ ner get their entire training and that is an expensive and long @-@ term commitment to the families . &quot;
&quot; A@@ im@@ ee Bo@@ or@@ man , Simone Bil@@ es , and Mag@@ gie Han@@ ey , trainer of Lau@@ rie Her@@ nan@@ dez , have both trained their athletes since they started with the gymn@@ as@@ tics . &quot;
&quot; we have to give the municipalities au@@ n innumerable , young girls inspired by Simone , Gab@@ by and Lau@@ rie , an affordable and easy to access exercise bike . &quot;
I founded my gymn@@ asi@@ um of 20 years .
&quot; at my events , we have offered free and affordable tur@@ nes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban juven@@ iles ( especially black and His@@ panic ) and trained national and international winners . &quot;
&quot; in September we will expand to Detroit ( my hom@@ etown ) to offer high @-@ quality gymn@@ as@@ tics , which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport . &quot;
&quot; gymn@@ as@@ tics develops strength , flexibility , and coordination for the body as well as hard work , discipline and determination for the mind . &quot;
this combination offers life @-@ long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success .
it is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymn@@ asi@@ um and that &apos;s great .
&quot; it is so important to participate in sports , especially for girls . &quot;
this is such an exciting time .
&quot; thanks Simone , A@@ ly , Lau@@ rie , Gab@@ by and Ma@@ dison for this genuine representation of &quot; Girl Power &quot; by holding the Olympic team gol@@ ds and thank you , you motiv@@ ate so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy , strong and successful young women . &quot;
assistant doctors would like to organise more strikes after they rejected Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t &apos;s proposal
&quot; the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adop@@ ting a re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association , but 58 percent of the 3@@ 7.@@ 000 Assistant Doc@@ tors who voted in favor of a vote rejected it . &quot;
&quot; in July , Hun@@ t plans to introduce the contract , and said that the N@@ HS would be found in a &quot; &quot; No Man &apos;s Land &quot; &quot; and that any further delay for the employees and patients would be harmful . &quot;
&quot; the first assistance centers are expected to receive a new contract , which includes changes to night and weekend workers to improve maintenance of adverse times . &quot;
&quot; Dr Ellen Mc@@ Court , the president of the BM@@ A committee for assistance physicians reported last night in a message with &quot; &quot; Assistance doctors have still serious concerns about the proposed contract , in particular , that it will inc@@ ur the current mat@@ ernity crisis and it will be given to treat all doctors . &quot;
&quot; with only eight weeks remaining until the first group of doctors fall under the new contract , progress must be made and the time runs out . &quot;
efforts on the part of the BM@@ A to resolve disputes by conversations struck the government for reluct@@ ance and sometimes to de@@ af@@ ening silence .
&quot; this was done by a promise that Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t had made last month , that his door would always be open . &quot;
&quot; Jerem@@ y Hun@@ t must act now , lift up the condition and address the concerns of the assistant doctors . &quot;
&quot; if he does not , the assistance specialists have made it clear that they are ready to carry out further work combat measures . &quot;
&quot; the last strike at the end of April saw a surge of nearly 13@@ ,000 routine operations and 100,000 appointments , as nur@@ ses and specialists were involved to cover doctors on the strike scar@@ ce chain . &quot;
the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by accepting the re@@ formed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association .
&quot; the BM@@ A would like to have a better week &apos;s pay for the 5@@ 4,000 veter@@ in@@ arians who are subject to the contract . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Mor@@ timer , General Director of N@@ HS employees , urged the assistant doctors to stop the strike . &quot;
&quot; Mor@@ timer said : &quot; &quot; labour action measures achieve nothing that little , but burden already over@@ loaded teams and service providers and prepare for patients , nur@@ ses and their families only worry , need and inter@@ ruption . &quot;
&quot; in the last two months , we talked to the Assistant Doc@@ tors and responded positively to concerns regarding guar@@ di@@ an@@ ship and whi@@ st@@ leb@@ low@@ ings with the Ministry of Health and other mini@@ stries . &quot;
&quot; employers hoped that continuing positive commitment to other important topics - such as posting , flexibility in training courses , training courses , mutual recognition of the curriculum , training holidays and the gender pay gap in medicine - were a sign of how serious it was the employers , the Health Education England and the Ministry of Health related to compliance with the BM@@ A in November , February and May . &quot;
&quot; the £ 2 @-@ per day medication , which can reduce the risk of heart attacks &quot;
thousands of heart attacks patients will benefit from a £ 2 @-@ per @-@ day medicine after recommended by the authorities to admini@@ ster this more people for a longer period of time .
the coag@@ ul@@ ant Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or drug reduces the risk of repeated heart attacks for people with heart disease .
&quot; the medication is administered for 12 months after a heart attack , reducing the risk of stroke or other heart attacks . &quot;
the N@@ HS regulation office has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
the N@@ HS regulation office has recommended a four @-@ year @-@ long intake to further reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems .
&quot; around 140@@ ,000 people suffer from a heart attack every year and a quarter of them suffer from a further heart attack or stroke . &quot;
&quot; heart attacks and strokes are caused by accum@@ ulations of fatty material in the ar@@ tery walls , which form plaque . &quot;
&quot; when the layer breaks apart , it can cause a blood cl@@ ots causing the blood flow to the heart and thereby causing a heart attack . &quot;
&quot; when the blood cl@@ ots trigger , it can flow through the blood stream and clo@@ g blood flow to the brain , causing a stroke . &quot;
individuals who have already had a heart attack are subject to higher risk .
&quot; Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or , which is produced by the British company A@@ stra@@ Zen@@ eca and marketed under the trade name Bri@@ li@@ que , reduces this risk by making the formation of blood cl@@ ots impro@@ b@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the draft of N@@ ICE , which was published today recommends a 12 @-@ month intake of 90@@ mg of Tic@@ ino , followed by 60@@ mg with a twice daily intake of aspir@@ in for the next three years . &quot;
&quot; Professor Car@@ ole Long@@ son , director of the N@@ ICE health care centre , said : &quot; despite the availability of secondary prevention , a quarter of all people who have suffered a heart attack have another heart attack or stroke - often with disa@@ strous consequences . &quot;
the fear of a renewed heart attack can have significant negative effects on the quality of life of a person .
experience shows that Tic@@ ino in combination with aspir@@ in is effective in reducing further heart attacks and strokes among people who already had a heart attack .
&quot; due to the preliminary recommendation of Tic@@ ino rel@@ or , we are pleased that we are able to extend available treatment options to thousands of people who can benefit from it . &quot;
the information on the efficacy and safety of Tic@@ ag@@ rel@@ or - especially the risk of bleeding - is limited to a period of up to three years .
culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness makes electoral fraud blo@@ oming in Muslim areas
&quot; last year , the former mayor of Tower Ham@@ lets Lut@@ ry Rah@@ man was removed from office due to corruption . &quot;
a culture of Political Cor@@ rect@@ ness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is know@@ ingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed .
&quot; Sir Eric Pick@@ les , former cabinet member , verb@@ ally attacks the police , election observers and town halls to ignore proof of election abuse based on &quot; &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to eth@@ ni@@ city and religion &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the former Minister for Integration and Local Government , who is now an anti @-@ corruption king , said that the in@@ timi@@ dation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of elec@@ tive cabins , in order to protect in@@ timi@@ dated voters . &quot;
&quot; he recommends that voters should take a passport with them , in order to prove their identity in elections . &quot;
&quot; at present , a vot@@ er merely needs to name his name and address . &quot;
the report proposes to apply non @-@ removable ink to a person &apos;s finger when they vote on their vote to prevent someone choosing twice .
&quot; whi@@ st@@ le@@ blo@@ wers should receive more protection , says Sir Eric . &quot;
he demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of un@@ official committees or working groups .
&quot; this serves not only against electoral fraud , but is also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and fiscal culture associated with it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the report was ordered by Down@@ ing Street as a result of Tower Ham@@ let &apos;s election sc@@ andal in eastern London .
&quot; last year , a special court ruled that the reign@@ ing mayor Lut@@ sk Rah@@ man should be dismissed after a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry . &quot;
&quot; the Court found that Rah@@ man had &quot; &quot; per@@ vert the religious feelings of his Muslim community &quot; &quot; and that he had sil@@ enced his critics with racism and Islam@@ opho@@ bia . &quot;
Rah@@ man is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him .
up to 300 votes were either dou@@ bt@@ ful or the result of im@@ itation in which a person was chosen as someone else .
Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country .
&quot; in particular , he vo@@ iced alarm on the frau@@ dul@@ ent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose candidates of their choice . &quot;
&quot; Sir Eric , pic@@ tured , made several recommendations to clean the electoral system , including guiding out to prove the identity &quot;
&quot; in his report it says : &quot; &quot; evidence has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised , especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly , in particular communities with Pakistan or Banglad@@ es@@ hi background . &quot;
there were concerns that ... state institutions would have know@@ ingly ignored such behavior on the basis of &quot; politically correct &quot; hyper@@ sensitivity to the eth@@ ni@@ city and religion .
&quot; Sir Eric spoke out 50 recommendations to clean the system , including the prohibition that political activists manipul@@ ate letter codes to stop &quot; &quot; elec@@ ting &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the report , which is considered by Ther@@ esa May , also requires tough@@ er registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud . &quot;
consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID .
use non @-@ removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone choosing twice .
systematic reviews of the nationality of a person perform to ensure that they are optional .
a three @-@ year limit on applications for an automatic postal voting .
prohibition that political activ@@ ist edit full brief@@ ings and envel@@ opes from post@@ elections .
&quot; &quot; &quot; give the police the authority to set up barriers to election @-@ stations . &quot;
a change of legislation which facilitates an accus@@ ation of in@@ timi@@ dation in accordance with the People Act 1983 ( People &apos;s Repres@@ entation Act 1983 ) .
photograph@@ ing in poll@@ ing stations .
requirement that only English can be used in the poll@@ ing stations ( except Wales ) .
&quot; intensi@@ fication of the training , in order to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go alone in the voting booth . &quot;
Sir Eric coinci@@ des with the Metropolitan Police and finds it &quot; amazing &quot; that after the Tower Ham@@ lets there was no complaint .
&quot; the election court has declared Lut@@ on Rah@@ man and his deputy for a lit@@ any of corrupt and illegal practices as un@@ suitable , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; due to a number of reasons , it was found guilty - in line with the high demands of criminal proceedings . &quot;
he also critic@@ ises the in@@ effective &quot; ti@@ cking controls &quot; of the elec@@ tive registration departments of the Town Hall .
Sir Eric said : &quot; the court ruling in Tower Ham@@ lets last year was a warning signal .
&quot; our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliam@@ ents , but the wor@@ rying and cover@@ t spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities thre@@ aten this good reputation . &quot;
crazy after K@@ ates Rad@@ ler @-@ Doppel@@ gän@@ ger and other famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger of Olympic athletes in Rio
fans of the 2016 Olympics in Rio will be amazed by the French cycl@@ ist Pau@@ line Ferr@@ and @-@ PRE@@ VO@@ T except the edge and the band who proved to be an impressive double female of the Du@@ chess of Cambridge .
&quot; but the 24 @-@ year @-@ old Olympics is by no means the only Ath@@ lete , who has his own famous Doppel@@ gän@@ ger - at least not , if one is allowed to believe the social media . &quot;
&quot; in honor of the Olympic Games in Rio and all the famous faces that fli@@ cker on our screens at the time , F@@ email has created a list of Olympics that show more than just a certain simil@@ arity to Hollywood celeb@@ ri@@ ties . &quot;
&quot; hunter and wolf : team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison , left , is compared since his childhood with Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio &quot;
&quot; besides K@@ ates Doppel@@ gän@@ ger on the cycling track , many people on the internet pointed out how a certain ar@@ cher could be the twin of the twin of A @-@ Pro@@ mi Leonardo Di@@ Cap@@ rio . &quot;
the team member of the US team in arch@@ ery Bra@@ dy Ell@@ ison has caused a rush on Twitter after pictures on which he looks similar to the Wolf of Wall Street star .
&quot; in fact , the ar@@ cher got the ma@@ dness in the social media and admitted that he had already heard from his childhood that he looks like Leo . &quot;
&quot; I myself don &apos;t see a big simil@@ arity , except facial hair , &quot; &quot; said Bra@@ dy of Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post . &quot;
&quot; he is a good @-@ looking guy , so I think it &apos;s a compli@@ ment . &quot;
one of the most popular compar@@ isons since London 2012 will undoubtedly be the focal point of this year : the striking simil@@ arity between the British Wei@@ t@@ spr@@ inger Gre@@ g Ru@@ ther@@ ford and the popular actor N@@ eil Patrick Har@@ ris .
Russian gymn@@ ast Ali@@ ya Mu@@ staf@@ a with her big expressive eyes is supposed to be a double singer for the Cuban @-@ American singer Gl@@ oria Est@@ ef@@ an .
&quot; and in the swimming pool , the SA s@@ wimm@@ ers Cameron van der Bur@@ gh has been compared with G@@ le@@ e Star Matthew Mor@@ rison for years . &quot;
one gear higher : this user is the opinion that Nathan is the &quot; athle@@ tic version &quot; of the In@@ c@@ eption actor .
&quot; another modest comparison was drawn between the tennis star Raf@@ ael Nad@@ al and actor Jos@@ h Hart@@ nett , who has similar heavy ey@@ eb@@ rows and lips . &quot;
&quot; the Russian silver med@@ alist Yu@@ lia E@@ fi@@ mov@@ a shows more than just the sun@@ tann@@ ed skin and bl@@ ond hair like act@@ ress Ann@@ aly@@ n@@ ne Mc@@ C@@ ord , while the American Nathan was att@@ ested by fans , an &quot; athle@@ tic version of Joseph Gordon Lev@@ itt . &quot; &quot;
&quot; strong women : soccer star Hope Solo , left , and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter , right , have a similar face form and eyes &quot;
not the only one : a Twitter user was very happy that others also noticed the similarities .
theory in the space provided : according to this user there is perhaps one reason for the simil@@ arity of the couple .
a Twitter user explained their satisfaction that &quot; the rest of the internet thinks that Hope Solo and J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter are almost identical .
&quot; in fact , the US soccer star Hope Solo and D@@ ex@@ ter act@@ ress J@@ enni@@ fer Car@@ p@@ enter have an incredibly similar face shape and eyes . &quot;
&quot; other popular compar@@ isons included Ker@@ ri Wal@@ sh @-@ J@@ enn@@ ings and her smile , which is almost identical to that of act@@ ress Laura Lin@@ ney and the gold medal winner in Tur@@ ns Gab@@ by Douglas , who has her own beautiful , wide smile , similar to that of Br@@ ing It On Star Gabri@@ elle Union . &quot;

&quot; the Canadian broad@@ caster C@@ BC had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze , after one of his comment@@ ators said that the 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chinese float went &quot; &quot; like low &quot; &quot; and during the race like &quot; &quot; a pig died . &quot;
the comment@@ ator By@@ ron Mac@@ Don@@ al@@ ds thought that his microphone was off when he left his own opinions at the end of the 4x@@ 200m fre@@ estyle squ@@ ad@@ ron .
&quot; Mac@@ Donald , who had been caught in the C@@ BS commentary team to give more &quot; color , &quot; could be heard say : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
&quot; too excited , as she called , she died like a pig . &quot;

&quot; Ai Yan@@ han from China was described with the final 4 x 200 m @-@ style floating squ@@ ad@@ ron for women as follows : &quot; this little 14 @-@ year @-@ old Chin@@ es@@ in has lost the connection , baby . &quot;
the cri@@ tique of By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald on Twitter quickly and hard at which many asked him
Twitter users didn &apos;t get back when they heard how sensitive By@@ ron Mac@@ Donald was
&quot; another Twitter user Sarah Par@@ adi@@ s wrote : &quot; wow , # By@@ ron@@ Mac@@ Donald . &quot;
you represent the C@@ BC and Canada and let &apos;s all look like ra@@ cists . # ange@@ ek@@ elt .
&quot; a short time later , Scott Russ@@ el , who moder@@ ated the C@@ BC show , spoke live for the commentary of Mac@@ Donald and said : &quot; &quot; we ap@@ ologi@@ ze that the comment was broadcast on a swimming performance . &quot;
&quot; it was an un@@ fortunate wording , sorry it happened . &quot;
C@@ BC ap@@ ologi@@ zed at the end more than 90 times with the people who responded to the B@@ emer@@ le via Twitter
the Scott Russ@@ el comment@@ ator colleague had to ap@@ ologi@@ ze in the name of Mac@@ Donald
C@@ BC informed and ap@@ ologi@@ zed to more than 90 other Twitter users compla@@ ined about Mac@@ Donald &apos;s comments
the network also ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly and issued a message .
we sincer@@ ely regret that these statements were made and that it was possible for them to be broadcast .
&quot; yesterday night , we ap@@ ologi@@ zed quickly to our audience and our followers in the social media . &quot;
&quot; to clarify one , By@@ ron &apos;s comments related to the performance of the float and not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , they were in@@ appropriate and an un@@ fortunate wording . By@@ ron does what he said very sorry . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday afternoon Mac@@ Donald ap@@ ologi@@ zed in the show and tried to justify his remark , saying that it was not his intention that it was designed as a personal attack . &quot;
&quot; I would like to take a moment to ap@@ ologi@@ ze for the comment I made after the Women &apos;s Flo@@ oring in the C@@ BC Olympics , he said . &quot;
&quot; I have focused on the performance of the float , not on them as a person . &quot;
&quot; of course , no contemp@@ t was intended and I am very sorry . &quot;
buyers in Pri@@ mark are ou@@ tra@@ ged by women who sham@@ elessly adverti@@ se in the business
&quot; the buyers didn &apos;t know where to go , when a woman pulled her clothes in the middle of a Pri@@ mark to taste under@@ pants . &quot;
&quot; to make the situation worse , she scrut@@ ini@@ zed how she looked at it , pulled it out and put it back into the shelf . &quot;
they continued and tried four pairs of under@@ pants in a shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone .
&quot; the Pri@@ mark shop at Bou@@ ver@@ ie Place Shopping Mall in Folk@@ estone , where the woman sam@@ pled the under@@ pants before she put her back on the shelf &quot;
&quot; a mother of two children , J@@ enny Davi@@ dson , who was at the same time in business , said that after the mysterious woman had tried under@@ wear , she went back and left the shop without buying anything . &quot;
&quot; she said , &quot; &quot; People couldn &apos;t believe what they saw . &quot;
&quot; standing in the middle of the shop floor , she took a pair of under@@ pants from the delivery , pulled out her own ti@@ ghts and trousers and tasted them . &quot;
&quot; she did not even try to find a more discreet place to do it - she just stood there , che@@ ek@@ y like O@@ sk@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; everyone star@@ ed when she pulled out the under@@ pants that you obviously didn &apos;t like , as she put her back on the shelf . &quot;
she repeated the same with three other under@@ pants before she finally decided that she did not like it and went out again .
she didn &apos;t seem to distur@@ b anyone watching - or thinking about the person who under circumstances would buy the under@@ pants that she had tried .
&quot; Davi@@ dson , 33 , who lives in K@@ ent said : &quot; &quot; how reluct@@ ant to think someone would take home pants that had another person and who were not washed . &quot;
the incident happened on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; Davi@@ dson added : &quot; &quot; as I have received , the employees have tried to withdraw the garments from selling after they went - which is just as good . &quot;
I would hate to go home with a new pair of under@@ pants and find out that another woman had her and went out and they were not washed .
&quot; Pri@@ mark spokes@@ man said , &quot; Pri@@ mark is aware of the incident occurred on Tuesday , 9 August at our branch in Folk@@ stone . &quot;
all products coming into question were withdrawn from the sale .
how to protect yourself with Kra@@ v Mag@@ a from weapons attacks
the world outside is a dangerous place but this video of Dail@@ y@@ mail@@ .com could make it a bit safer for you .
&quot; we talked to Rh@@ one Miz@@ ra@@ chi , a Grand Master of the Kra@@ v Mag@@ a Association in New York , to find out how to deal with armed rob@@ bers at close distance . &quot;
&quot; regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind , this video will show you how to turn your sk@@ ewer to the sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; if you are approaching you from behind , then you should turn around as first so that you can see your attack@@ er and &quot; go out of the shot , &quot; says Miz@@ ra@@ chi . &quot;
then take the weapon between your for@@ ear@@ m and your shoulder before hitting it with your free el@@ bow .
beat him with his knee in the bar and twist the gun out of his hands while the attack@@ er cl@@ ut@@ ches away from pain . strike him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the gun on him .
&quot; for attack@@ ers approaching from the front , the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line , grab the gun and twist it so that the attack@@ er can not shoot . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attack@@ er to the chest , then twist the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it . &quot;
sounds difficult ?
watch the video to see exactly what Mas@@ ra@@ chi is doing .
&quot; but remember that when a rob@@ ber@@ y is the saf@@ est way to over@@ turn your money , unless you are a Master Grand Master . &quot;
trav@@ eller Ian W@@ right sh@@ ab@@ t his tongue in the dir@@ ti@@ est places of Europe for a travel guide
a British trav@@ eller under@@ took his immune system and lit@@ ters of serious testing by li@@ cking some of the dir@@ ti@@ est and most disgu@@ sting places in Europe .
&quot; the present@@ er and travel author Ian W@@ right , 51 , from Su@@ ff@@ ol@@ k dropped his course on a Euro bill , a ban@@ ister at Pic@@ ca@@ dil@@ ly Circus , a r@@ ins@@ ing button of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resili@@ ence of his immune system . &quot;
&quot; before dropping any object , he used a lumin@@ ometer to show up and show us what he is going to get involved . &quot;
&quot; but the experiment , which was filmed under the title &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; brought some surprising results . &quot;
&quot; the thought of le@@ aking the r@@ ins@@ ing button of a tow@@ ing toilet , which has already been used by thousands of others , may be completely rep@@ ul@@ sive , but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink . &quot;
&quot; on his journey through Europe , Mr. W@@ right spoke with doctors and medical professionals concerning the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health . &quot;
&quot; fortunately , nothing he li@@ cked aside was more than a bad after@@ taste in the mouth . &quot;
W@@ right was known to test the resistance of his bow@@ els by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things .
&quot; from public hand@@ rails to railway stations to r@@ ins@@ ing kno@@ bs of toilets , the task has defini@@ tively put its immune system under a sample &quot;
&quot; in the film , he said : &quot; as a child I was relatively in@@ concerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth , earth , worms and mud water . &quot;
&quot; in the film , he was able to do justice to his reputation . &quot;
the only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia .
his sample @-@ painting showed a lumin@@ ometric rating of more than 4000 units .
&quot; compared to this , the lumin@@ ous number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60 . &quot;
&quot; but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to le@@ ash after their lumin@@ aries count over 4000 units , while freshly washed hands have less than 60 &quot;
&quot; Mr. W@@ right and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o produced the travel film &quot; The Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength , &quot; which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom . &quot;
in the film he says : &quot; this comes close to the worst I have ger@@ o@@ yed in a toilet .
there is nothing worse than that !
I won &apos;t lick anything here because it is disgu@@ sting here .
&quot; the Li@@ ck@@ hi@@ ker &apos;s Guide to In@@ ner Str@@ ength &quot; was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Vali@@ o .
&quot; the company equi@@ ps Mr. W@@ right with Vali@@ o Gef@@ il@@ us , which contains lac@@ tic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system . &quot;
&quot; vali@@ os Senior Venice President for Snacks , S@@ haf@@ ts and New Categories Ni@@ ko Vu@@ or@@ en@@ ma@@ a says : &quot; we really wanted to offer consumers something new . &quot;
something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of pro@@ biotics .
we performed crazy bra@@ inst@@ or@@ ming that ended that we said &quot; Let &apos;s call us Ian . &quot;
they claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon
&quot; instead of talking about the products , we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment , the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system . &quot;
the growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way .
I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour !
&quot; Tom Hak@@ ala , who directed the film directing , added : &quot; let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him , just like the disgu@@ sting Russian toilet , which is shown in the film . &quot;
&quot; of course , there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others , in which this was quite difficult . &quot;
I &apos;m glad we recorded some of these dirty goo@@ dies on film .
&quot; in a survey conducted by Vali@@ o , 84 percent of all sur@@ vey@@ ed lac@@ tic acid bacteria associated with the wellbeing of stomach and bow@@ el and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing attached lac@@ tic acid bacteria . &quot;
&quot; as@@ o@@ cial family destro@@ ys social flat in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall &quot;
&quot; an as@@ o@@ cial family left their social flat after a del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation with a loss of £ 50,000 because they terr@@ orized their neighbors . &quot;
&quot; T@@ anya Skel@@ don and her partner Sh@@ au@@ n Tre@@ bil@@ cock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in S@@ alt@@ ash , Corn@@ wall . &quot;
&quot; after they were forci@@ bly removed from their property , shocked employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an irre@@ parable state . &quot;
&quot; the walls had holes perfor@@ ated , wooden plan@@ ks were torn up , rub@@ b@@ ish was spread on the floor and gra@@ ff@@ iti was s@@ me@@ ared to the walls . &quot;
the family has been reloc@@ ated and it is believed that it now lives in a private accommodation
&quot; Don@@ na Mc@@ E@@ voy , who works for home management at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired . &quot;
she said : &quot; it was an absolute night@@ mare for people here and I think that people don &apos;t have to live in this way .
there are many things to consider as this property is probably considered as not as beautiful part of Corn@@ wall .
the family is not@@ orious and its reputation is likewise .
&quot; the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflic@@ ted was street fights with bas@@ eball bats , in@@ timi@@ dation of residents , drug abuse , drug trafficking and excessive cries , disputes and cur@@ ses . &quot;
&quot; Skel@@ don , 47 , whose name stood on the lease , got an arrangement for anti@@ social behavior in June . &quot;
&quot; in some rooms of the house , which may be torn down under certain circumstances , old rub@@ b@@ ish was found . &quot;
&quot; in the estate , in which drugs were tra@@ ded in the past , the wooden plan@@ ks were torn up &quot;
neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly inv@@ oked the police .
Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing led her and her partner forci@@ bly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer .
the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was che@@ ered by ligh@@ tened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell .
&quot; one said , &quot; &quot; They didn &apos;t care for anybody . &quot;
we lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad .
the countless times we call the police here are incredible .
&quot; this morning we could not sleep . &quot;
we got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it !
&quot; now , where they are finally gone , it will be beautiful . &quot;
&quot; Adam F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck , N@@ eigh@@ bour@@ hood En@@ forcement Manager at Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing , said it had taken the family to co @-@ operate with local authorities . &quot;
&quot; the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals , for 20 years &quot;
&quot; on the over@@ grown side of the community house , garbage and old toys were thrown down . &quot;
&quot; he added : &quot; &quot; it is a shame that the ten@@ ant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family , as a dele@@ tion is always the last step taken into account by Corn@@ wall H@@ ousing . &quot;
this was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible .
&quot; I appreciate all the work my team , the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police , as well as members of the community who have cour@@ age@@ ously approached us and have given us the information . &quot;
I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti @-@ social behaviour will not be tolerated .
&quot; F@@ itz@@ patri@@ ck said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house , but that they were all over 20 . &quot;

&quot; in 2014 , the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70@@ g of cannabis as well as scales , par@@ ap@@ her@@ n@@ als and cash in the amount of £ 1,@@ 700 . &quot;
Skel@@ don was sentenced to a fine after having found guilty of a class B drug in commercial vision .
she claimed that the money was for a tom@@ b@@ stone of her son Lee Skel@@ don who died in a car accident in 2013 .
&quot; after being homeless , T@@ anya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Pl@@ ym@@ outh . &quot;
many of the rooms of the house were decorated with gra@@ ff@@ iti .
the police say that they will navigate rent@@ ers who don &apos;t cling to the house rules
&quot; Angela C@@ row of the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police said that the del@@ o@@ gi@@ ation was a clear warning to the other tenants , who do not stick to the house rules . &quot;
&quot; this goes to those who think they can behave without self @-@ repro@@ ach , as well as those who have been har@@ med by such a behaviour , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the De@@ von and Corn@@ wall police will never tolerate criminal and anti @-@ social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities .
tourists in Portugal are reloc@@ ated to Portugal after an open @-@ air military jet over@@ flies the beach
&quot; sun worshi@@ ppers at Av@@ eiro , Portugal experienced the shock of their lives &quot;
a Portuguese P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft of the Air Force deployed an incredible crash
&quot; the Air Force claimed that it was on a training flight , but insi@@ sted that there was no security risk . &quot;
this was the moment when sc@@ ared tourists start to panic after an open jet crashes over a full beach .
dramatic video recordings showed how military aircraft flew almost within close proximity to the sun worshi@@ ppers on the beach in Av@@ eiro in the north of Portugal .
&quot; the vac@@ ation@@ ers jumped up when they agreed to worry about the noise of the nozzle @-@ drives , without first seeing what came up through the clouds . &quot;
&quot; the incident happened yesterday afternoon in Costa Nova , near Av@@ eiro . &quot;
&quot; Daniel Fern@@ andes , one of the many tourists who posted videos on the dramatic Fly @-@ By in the social media said : &quot; &quot; it flew very deep twice and there was a moment when it looked like it would crash . &quot;
&quot; N@@ un@@ o Ar@@ ro@@ ja added : &quot; &quot; I was just surfing and it felt like the plane would fall down on me . &quot;
tourists on the beach of Av@@ eiro were terri@@ fied when the plane came from the darkness and flew incredibly deeply
&quot; the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot of the P @-@ 3@@ C Ori@@ on aircraft was on a training flight to identify fishing boats in front of the coast , and to fly so deeply that this was the only way to see them . &quot;
&quot; the speaker said that the jet flew a little deeper than usual due to the bad visibility of the area around the area , but the air strikes insi@@ sted that safety at no time was at risk . &quot;
area fires destroyed parts of the Portuguese mainland this summer where four people on Madeira Island died to death .
&quot; the Portuguese air forces announced today that the pilot had to fly so deeply because of the conditions - heavy fog and fire smoke , which limits his view . &quot;
the plane was on a training flight where the pilot had to identify f@@ isher boats as part of the exercise .
Super@@ cup : Bar@@ ca with worries about Sev@@ ille
Sev@@ ille - FC Barcelona fights for the first step in the new soccer season on Sunday .
&quot; the Catal@@ ans compete against FC Sevilla in the du@@ el around the Spanish Super@@ cup , the back@@ lash will rise three days later at Camp No@@ u . &quot;
&quot; the Dou@@ ble@@ gew@@ inner must abst@@ ain from taking power with the defeated Cup@@ fin@@ alists and reign@@ ing Europa League Champion among others on N@@ ey@@ mar , who contest the Olympic football tournament with Brazil . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Go@@ alie Marc @-@ Andr@@ e ter is missing . &quot;
&quot; the German suffered a leg change in the knee in the training , which clari@@ fied the question at least initially for the benefit of Claudio Bra@@ vo at least for the time being . &quot;
the Chil@@ ean International and T@@ er St@@ egen have been competing for the status as number one in Barcelona for two years .
&quot; coach Luis En@@ rique has so far refra@@ ined from making a clear decision and left Bra@@ vo in the League , but T@@ er St@@ egen in most other applications makes progress . &quot;
&quot; before the first mandatory game of the new season , there are doubts about the fitness condition of the crew , which was humili@@ ated on Saturday in a test run of Liverpool with 0 : 4 . &quot;
also at 3 : 2 in the pro@@ s@@ ular op@@ p against S@@ amp@@ d@@ oria on Wednesday Li@@ onel Mess@@ i and Co. did not really convince .
&quot; Sev@@ ille , in turn , has to di@@ gest the 2 : 3 defeat after extension in the European Super@@ cup against Real Madrid and stri@@ ves for the second triumph at the Super@@ cop@@ a de Esp@@ ana . &quot;
&quot; with so far 11 successes , Barcelona has been the record winner in this competition . &quot;
Ma Long in your own league for ping p@@ ong gold
Rio de Janeiro - The Chinese Ma Long is the new table tennis champion .
&quot; on Thursday in Rio de Janeiro , the 27 @-@ year @-@ old defeated his comp@@ atri@@ ot and &quot; defending champion &quot; Z@@ hang Ji@@ ke 4 : 0 ( 12,@@ 5,@@ 4,4 ) . &quot;
&quot; the world rank@@ ings first won the &quot; Golden Grand S@@ lam &quot; with successes at World Cup , World Cup , World @-@ Tour Fin@@ als Tournam@@ ent and even Olympia . &quot;
bronze went to the Japanese Ju@@ n Mi@@ fun@@ ani .
the two Chinese made it into the final game as expected and made the title among themselves .
&quot; it was clear that for the third time in a row , a Chinese would fetch the single title in the sign of the Five rings . &quot;
last non @-@ Chinese at the top Olympic podium was the former SV@@ S @-@ N@@ Ö Legi@@ on@@ ary Ry@@ u Se@@ ung @-@ min from South Korea .
&quot; Ma and Z@@ hang were left alone on the disk , between the sentences and in time @-@ outs they had no coaches with them . &quot;
they had moved back to the tri@@ b@@ une and left their prot@@ é@@ mit@@ es on their own in a fair competition alone .
&quot; the matches right here I played for my country . &quot;
&quot; in the final I play for myself , &quot; Z@@ hang had said logical . &quot;
&quot; after the game , gold and silver med@@ alli@@ sts posed with the China flag . &quot;
the match itself was un@@ expect@@ edly un@@ ilater@@ al .
Ma had really to fight with his 28 @-@ year @-@ old ad@@ versary only in the first set .
&quot; after that , he set the tempo on the plate and left Z@@ hang from there only a total of 13 points . &quot;
&quot; through the superi@@ ority of Ma , it did not develop the expected thrilling match . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , enough stunning ball changes were to be seen . &quot;
Mi@@ fun@@ ani won the game for bronze against the 40 @-@ year @-@ old Vladimir Sam@@ son@@ ov 4 : 1 .
&quot; in his quarter @-@ final against the German European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ char@@ ov , the white @-@ rus@@ hing had pulled a rib@@ bing injury , after that he had to be satisfied with sheet metal after that . &quot;
&quot; by the way , the Swe@@ des Jan @-@ O@@ ve Wald@@ ner ( 38 / 2004 ) and Jör@@ gen Per@@ sson ( 42 / 2008 ) were in similar high table tennis old Olympia @-@ Vi@@ erte . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp ad@@ mits ″ tremendous problems ″ in the election campaign
&quot; the leadership of the US re@@ public@@ ans is pla@@ gu@@ ed by massive concerns , even in traditional conservative states . &quot;
presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has now identified weaknesses of his election campaign in the former Republi@@ can strongh@@ old of U@@ tah .
&quot; a rare moment in which the Mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary usually appears as a large @-@ gauge and self @-@ contained mul@@ tim@@ il@@ li@@ on@@ ary , as reported by correspon@@ dents . &quot;
&quot; after throwing 16 ri@@ vals within the own republi@@ can camp , doubts about his success in the fight for the White House are growing . &quot;
&quot; we have huge problems in U@@ tah , &quot; said Tru@@ mp before evangel@@ ical Christians , who asked for support in important states like Ohio , Florida or Virginia . &quot;
&quot; guilt is false reports on his can@@ did@@ acy , he resum@@ ed his well @-@ known media s@@ add@@ les . &quot;
republi@@ can strongh@@ olds w@@ ack@@ ling
U@@ tah is usually a secure bank for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans .
&quot; according to a survey conducted by Sur@@ vey@@ us in June , Tru@@ mp and his assistant from the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , were at the same time . &quot;
&quot; other institutes see Tru@@ mp in the front , but not with the gap that is common for Republi@@ can candidates in the state . &quot;
Arizona and Georgia are also regarded as endangered .
&quot; in an interview by the CN@@ BC , Tru@@ mp answered the question how he wanted to stop the advance of Clinton : &quot; just as I did so far . &quot;
&quot; and afterwards : this will be &quot; either successful , or I will make a very beautiful , long holiday . &quot;
he does not make any difference when &quot; telling the truth . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is fine , Tru@@ mp said . &quot;
then I return to a very good way of living .
&quot; according to press reports , the Tru@@ mp party should have threatened to strike funds for the support of his election campaign , he should not present any better survey values . &quot;
&quot; instead of this , the candidates of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans want to hold the Congress more strongly for the Congress . &quot;
Olympia : tri@@ est fraud in dop@@ ing test
the IO@@ C wants to set up a disciplinary committee .
K@@ eni@@ as athletes thre@@ aten after the second dop@@ ing affair at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; after a fraud attempt at a dop@@ ing control in the Olympic village , Kenya has sent a trainer home . &quot;
the International Olympic Committee informed me immediately to set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case .
&quot; a Ken@@ yan function@@ ary stated that the former S@@ printer and today &apos;s coach , John An@@ z@@ rah , have released a urine sample under the name of the 800 metre runner F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ er in the Olympic village . &quot;
this was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the dop@@ ing controllers .
IA@@ AF has requested the IO@@ C for information about the case in order to ex@@ ert its own investigations into an IA@@ AF speaker .
&quot; depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IO@@ C , IA@@ AF will evaluate an evaluation , &quot; said the IA@@ AF . &quot;
&quot; he ( An@@ z@@ rah ) went to the D@@ oping control station and spent himself as F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Rot@@ i , handed the sample and signed it , &quot; explained K@@ eni@@ as boss de Mission Stephan Ara@@ p So@@ i . &quot;
he was in possession of the accreditation of the ath@@ lete who stood on the list for training controls of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency .
F@@ erg@@ us@@ on Red had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015 .
four days before the Ken@@ yan Ath@@ le@@ tics delegation leader Michael Rot@@ ich was deduc@@ ted from the Rio Games .
he is said to have informed about pending dop@@ ing tests against cash payments athletes of his country .
&quot; according to media reports , he was said to have been arrested on his return at the Nairobi airport . &quot;
&quot; in Kenya , the IO@@ C has been under special observation after numerous dop@@ ing off@@ ences for a long time . &quot;
&quot; at the announcement of the more than 2000 dop@@ ing target controls submitted by the IO@@ C before the Rio Games , it was previously pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted . &quot;
the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency had exer@@ ted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti @-@ dop@@ ing law and a functioning control system .
the law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics .
&quot; as a consequence , WA@@ DA has adopted Kenya from the list of countries whose dop@@ ing control is compliant with the rules of WA@@ DA . &quot;
Kenya is considered a great runner @-@ up nation .
the athletes of the country won most medals at the 2015 World Cup in Beijing .
&quot; in a series of TV reports of the ARD , accus@@ ations have been raised again and again that dop@@ ing means are easily accessible in Kenya and there should be a considerable mentality of sports fraud . &quot;
IO@@ C member Richard Po@@ und finally called for a similar investigation in Kenya as he had employed in Russian athle@@ tics .
it has been proven that in this type of sport it was widely used and systematically recorded .
Russian athletes were then excluded from the summer games .
&quot; &quot; &quot; West Side Story &quot; &quot; with Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli &quot;
&quot; in the Shakespeare year , the Salzburg Festival presents the &quot; West Side Story &quot; with Tony and Maria as a tragic couple , similar to Romeo and Juli@@ et . &quot;
with a surprising Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli .
&quot; a musical conqu@@ ers Salzburg : the &quot; West Side Story , &quot; Le@@ orn@@ ard Bernstein &apos;s masterpiece . &quot;
&quot; the artistic director , Ceci@@ lia Bart@@ oli , wanted to bring the musical into the temple of classical music and filled with the role of Mary a youth mare . &quot;
&quot; the orchestra pit the Sim@@ ón Bol@@ í@@ var Orchestra under the direction of the Venezu@@ el@@ an conductor Gu@@ st@@ av@@ o Du@@ dam@@ el : &quot; &quot; this music is full of rhythm , &quot; &quot; he enth@@ uses . &quot;
we always say that it is very Latin American .
there are many Latin American ingredients at their pace and melody .
&quot; it is a wonderful mix , the perfect recipe for our orchestra . &quot;
I would say that we really have amber music in our blood !
Bart@@ oli plays an older Mary in this staging .
&quot; she reminds herself of her love with Tony , while the younger Maria plays and dances . &quot;
the role of Mary always fascinated me .
&quot; first , because it &apos;s musi@@ cally extraordinary ! &quot;
and then there would be Mary &apos;s personality .
&quot; she says it in her song : &quot; I feel pretty , oh so pretty , I feel pretty and wit@@ ty and bright . &quot;
&quot; so it is wise , of course na@@ ï@@ ve , and very passionate . &quot;
&quot; it resembles me very much , my Italian character I have as a Roman , &quot; &quot; laughs Bart@@ oli . &quot;
Du@@ dam@@ el is full of praise for the opera singer : &quot; Ceci@@ lia is a wonderful artist . &quot;
it is such an honour to work with her .
it is an enormously generous person .
and Bart@@ oli adds the compli@@ ment : &quot; Du@@ dam@@ el is such an exceptional artist and very passionate ! &quot;
conducting is a necessity for him .
&quot; one sees it in each of his movements , in his eyes , it is his life ! &quot;
it is such a huge opportunity to share this musical experience with him .
&quot; we both have a rather southern temper@@ ament , a fire , a passion and a cheerful approach to life , which is very important at all ! &quot;
&quot; for American director Philip W@@ m . Mc@@ Kin@@ ley , the West Side Story is up @-@ to @-@ date : &quot; this piece deals with prejudi@@ ces and fan@@ ati@@ cism . &quot;
&quot; today we have the refugees , then the Pu@@ pp@@ ies went to New York , and the New York residents did not want them . &quot;
they are the same topics and they are as meaningful today as back then .
&quot; 59 years later , the piece is still relevant . &quot;
London school@@ girl who joined the IS was killed in Syria
&quot; K@@ adi@@ za Sul@@ tana , one of three British school@@ girls left in London last year to join the IS died reports in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the lawyer Tas@@ ni@@ me A@@ kun@@ je@@ e said that a few weeks ago her family heard about her death in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , Syria . &quot;
&quot; it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Ra@@ q@@ q@@ a , the strongh@@ old of the group in the country , I@@ TV news reported on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; Sul@@ tana was 17 years old and , according to her family , died shortly after she had prepared to leave the country @-@ torn country and to return to England . &quot;
&quot; one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision , &quot; &quot; said A@@ kun@@ je@@ e . &quot;
&quot; in February 2015 , Sul@@ tana and two other ma@@ ids from the east of London rose to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border . &quot;
Sul@@ tan@@ as &apos;s family was told that she married an IS@@ IS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow .
&quot; Rei@@ d says that in the case of an election victory in Gar@@ land , Clinton would remain as candidates for the Supreme Court &quot;
&quot; Harry Rei@@ d , leader of the Democrats in the Senate , is convinced that the presidential candidate of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , will nom@@ inate the Ju@@ dge Mer@@ ri@@ ck Gar@@ land for the Supreme Court . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in the Senate have blocked Gar@@ lands &apos;s confirmation since its nom@@ ination by Barack Obama in March .
the majority leader in the Senate Mit@@ ch Mc@@ Con@@ n@@ ell believes that the next president will appoint the successor of the late Ju@@ dge at the Supreme Court Anton@@ in Sc@@ alia .
&quot; on Thursday , Rei@@ d said during a telephone conference that he expects Gar@@ land to choose Gar@@ land with a certain degree of certainty . &quot;
a spokes@@ woman of Rei@@ d later said that he would not have talked to Clinton if she would nom@@ inate Gar@@ land and he spec@@ ulated .
he praised Gar@@ land and said that Clinton &apos;s team would not worry about un@@ rest with a new candidate .
Gar@@ land is the supreme court for the U.S. Court of Appe@@ als for the District of Columbia .
&quot; in RAID , Repub@@ lic@@ ans blocked the Gar@@ lands nom@@ ination , were Lak@@ ai@@ en and Hel@@ per of Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp . &quot;
he also noted that Donald Tru@@ mp was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
Tre@@ ats wants naked cal@@ endar@@ s for &quot; women and for men &quot;
the Tre@@ ats Magazine collabor@@ ates with photographer David Bel@@ le@@ mere to bring a 1970s Pir@@ elli @-@ inspired calendar for 2017 .
&quot; but instead of famous naked people , they want to find the next generation of super@@ models for their N@@ U M@@ uses Calendar for 2017 . &quot;
&quot; the chief editor of Tre@@ ats Steve Sha@@ w told us at the beginning of this year that his nude magazin of Old@@ school @-@ Play@@ boys disc@@ erns , since &quot; Play@@ boy is for men . &quot; &quot;
I do this for women .
apparently he is the opinion that it does the calendar as well .
&quot; we must return to the representation of timeless and classical nude in which both women and men feel comfortable and feel inspired by these images of a female body , &quot; Sha@@ w said in a press release for the publication of the calendar . &quot;
women will want to participate in this project because it is a beautiful work of art .
models can submit their images online or personally at open Cast@@ ing calls in Los Angeles and New York .
Turkey : Kurdish community comp@@ utes with mass cur@@ ses
&quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan sits on packed suit@@ cases , &quot; says the chairman of the Gü@@ len Foundation Di@@ alogue and World , Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of investig@@ ators to flee from Turkey to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in the medium term , even &quot; a few hundred thousand &quot; could be seen , the president of the association Ali Top@@ ra@@ k believes . &quot;
&quot; following the coup attempt by Turkish President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan , the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass escape to Germany after the coup attempt . &quot;
&quot; in the short term , I reck@@ on with tens of thousands , in the medium term with a few hundred thousand shel@@ ters from Turkey in Germany , if the Erdo@@ gan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition , &quot; &quot; says the President Ali Top@@ ra@@ k of the &quot; World &quot; of Friday . &quot;
&quot; because the government had over@@ taken Kurdish strongh@@ olds with pen@@ alties several months ago , there were 500,000 Kur@@ ds within Turkey on the run . &quot;
&quot; after the coup d &quot; é@@ tat , secular and op@@ posi@@ tional ethnic Turks were added . &quot;
many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be supp@@ ressed in Turkey .
&quot; it cannot be that a state which itself takes refugees , produces refugees in their own country , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k . &quot;
&quot; the head of the Union was compla@@ ining about the deliber@@ ate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish , but also in al@@ evi@@ tic cities . &quot;
&quot; in this way , Erdo@@ gan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kur@@ ds . &quot;
&quot; they are the last great minority in Turkey , the Christian Armen@@ ians and Greeks have already been eradic@@ ated or displaced in the past hundred years , &quot; said Top@@ ra@@ k , who is also a member of the CD@@ U . &quot;
the chairman of the association called for the Federal Government to be &quot; as sharp as Austria against Erdo@@ gan and his followers . &quot;
&quot; in Germany too , a &quot; witch @-@ hunt &quot; takes place against Erdo@@ gan @-@ critics . &quot;
&quot; in the last few months , I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time . &quot;
the German branch of the Gü@@ len movement also fears the escape of many Turks abroad .
&quot; more Turks will seek asylum in Germany , especially Kur@@ ds and Op@@ position@@ ists . &quot;
the br@@ anding as Gü@@ len @-@ followers destro@@ ys teachers and other academ@@ ics the professional existence .
&quot; whoever does not fit and pra@@ ises Erdo@@ gan sits on packed suit@@ cases , by the way also the Kem@@ alists and Sä@@ kul@@ ars , &quot; said Er@@ can Kar@@ ak@@ oy@@ un , chairman of the Gü@@ len Foundation Di@@ alogue and Education , the &quot; World . &quot; &quot;
&quot; as reported by the newspaper on appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of Interior , the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup . &quot;
&quot; as of June 30 , this has been 11.@@ 3@@ 86 men and therefore almost 29 percent of all accepted as asylum seekers ( 3@@ 9.@@ 6@@ 25 ) . &quot;
&quot; in this survey , they do not find themselves worthy of war , poverty or lack of prospects . &quot;
&quot; entitled to asylum in accordance with the Basic Law are exclusively political , i.e. by the state side , individually prosec@@ uted . &quot;

in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern they understood .
&quot; until 2021 , the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays , the Schwer@@ in Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; for stupid as yet , it doesn &apos;t work : summer holidays , heat and land@@ fill combat - that bites . &quot;
&quot; the locals , who are to be convinced of the elec@@ tors , are on holiday . &quot;
&quot; most of the vac@@ ation@@ ers in the country , on U@@ se@@ dom , Rügen or Hid@@ den@@ see , are not a local , so you can not choose the country day . &quot;
&quot; practical problems come : during the holidays , hel@@ pers who hang up posters , infl@@ ate ballo@@ ons , distribute fl@@ yers and en@@ um@@ er@@ ate voices in the end are just lab@@ orious . &quot;
&quot; until 4 September 2016 , the election and final holiday , Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern must once again pass a campaign against the people over themselves . &quot;
&quot; the hot phase , if you can say it at all , has just begun . &quot;
&quot; and it &apos;s also about something : Prime Minister Er@@ win Sell@@ ering , leader of an SPD / CD@@ U coalition , has to fear his office . &quot;
&quot; the SPD , the strongest party since 1998 , is now in p@@ olls clearly behind the CD@@ U . &quot;
exciting is how strongly Neu@@ ing Af@@ D cuts off and what remains in the end co@@ ali@@ tion@@ able .
&quot; Sell@@ ering , 66 years old and since 2008 head of government , makes an almost in@@ conspic@@ uous election campaign , one can see from his large posters . &quot;
&quot; he travels through the country , distri@@ butes roses and ch@@ ats a little with the people , just as he already did legendary predecessor Harald Ring@@ storff . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , sailors have got cold feet and chan@@ cell@@ or Merkel will blame for the thri@@ ving of Af@@ D . &quot;
&quot; their refugee policy , their &quot; We create this &quot; have ha@@ sten@@ ed the rise of right @-@ wing pop@@ uli@@ sts , which will probably cost him the beautiful office . &quot;
&quot; the CD@@ U with its top candidate , the Minister of the Interior , Lor@@ enz C@@ aff@@ ier , has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaigns at the wrong time at the wrong time . &quot;
she has invited Angela Merkel to big documents twice ; Merkel &apos;s Bundestag election is in the north @-@ east .
&quot; but the target group did not agree , there were more North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern . &quot;
&quot; there was probably the majority of other federal states , &quot; &quot; said Vincent Kok@@ ert , General Secretary of the CD@@ U in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , recently in N@@ DR . &quot;
but it &apos;s too bad no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel .
&quot; otherwise , the Nor@@ theast CD@@ U ren@@ oun@@ ces the usual electoral campaign across market@@ places and in front of shopping m@@ alls with umbr@@ ellas and ballo@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; so , co@@ ca@@ ine says , plays only a &quot; subordin@@ ate role . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Union has also noted that in the country , it is crum@@ bling away that it has to strain itself very much , to find a wire to the people again . &quot;
&quot; it is like the left , the SPD , the Gre@@ ens : hardly exists in the wi@@ den@@ ess of the country . &quot;
&quot; the Council of the CD@@ U elec@@ tor@@ ist Kok@@ ert on his comrades is also self @-@ expos@@ ing : &quot; &quot; they have to go where it hur@@ ts , namely where people are : Dor@@ ff@@ este , Golden weddings , every birthday party has to be used . &quot;
&quot; because a lot is in the game , Sell@@ ering has now called on his SPD to become a particularly engaged electoral campaign . &quot;
&quot; in p@@ olls , the Socialists and Democrats recently stood behind partner CD@@ U ( 25 ) and just above the Af@@ D ( 19 ) . &quot;
&quot; at the election 2011 , the SPD still clearly won 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent before the CD@@ U ( 22 ) . &quot;
&quot; the Green Party , a small party with seven percent in the p@@ olls , should make the leap into the land tag . &quot;
they make a modern virtue out of vacation @-@ need and transfer their campaign to the internet largely .
&quot; online election campaign , &quot; he calls the president of the country Claudia Müller . &quot;
&quot; apart from that , green elec@@ trop@@ hies hunt for local vocal ch@@ arities among holiday@@ makers . &quot;
&quot; Sil@@ ke Ga@@ je@@ k , the top candidate , is just riding a hous@@ ebo@@ at through the Mecklenburg lakes and still finds it beautiful . &quot;
your impression : &quot; holiday in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern is not a punishment . &quot;
B@@ 27 rehabilitation : restaurants suffer from blocking
there is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabil@@ itated .
&quot; for those responsible for the construction work , which will start at 5.@@ 30@@ am and end at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning , there are plenty of praise . &quot;
&quot; they have done everything pretty sha@@ ky , &quot; &quot; says El@@ vi@@ ra T@@ etz@@ la@@ ff from the jet fuel station . &quot;
this is a super team .
there is no delay .
&quot; the construction site was to be reloc@@ ated to the south at the beginning of the week , until the end of October everything should be ready . &quot;
&quot; also praised will be the receipt of those responsible for the construction works , for example when it comes to setting up residence in@@ takes . &quot;
&quot; since the construction site has been mig@@ rated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Asp@@ erg@@ om@@ straße in O@@ fter@@ dingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rot@@ ten@@ burg is again , the traffic situation within the place has eased . &quot;
the citizens can now travel from O@@ fter@@ dingen to the B 27 on both sides .
ev@@ asive traffic through the place seems to go back .
&quot; there were some considerable complaints , &quot; says the head manager Florian King responsible for the management of the refurb@@ ishment . &quot;
&quot; the residents of Bach@@ el@@ strasse , Stein@@ la@@ ch@@ straße , Haf@@ ner Street and Wei@@ her@@ rain had to fight with more traffic noise , because many sne@@ ers were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the sign@@ age . &quot;
what led to the fact that some trucks were fran@@ ch@@ ised in residential areas .
&quot; as the speed limits were not comp@@ lied with , the municipality increased the vehicle from M@@ ös@@ singen . &quot;
&quot; there were considerable transgres@@ sions , &quot; &quot; says King , who informed himself on the spot himself . &quot;
two to three per minute have been scored .
the quick@@ est was on the road with 77 kilometres of ho@@ ur@@ ly kilometres .
&quot; since the construction site has moved on , it has become cal@@ mer . &quot;
for the business@@ men at the B 27 it is only a little consol@@ ation that for customers from Rot@@ ten@@ burg the road is now open again .
business people don &apos;t like to look into the cards .
&quot; however , the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue bur@@ sts for them leaves anyone looking to look through . &quot;
&quot; however , some are more and less affected . &quot;
&quot; those who have less to do with the &quot; &quot; end customer &quot; &quot; are , therefore , produced for other companies , for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences . &quot;
&quot; even at the deal@@ ership of Mai@@ er Thomas Sul@@ z talks about a &quot; &quot; most moderate decline &quot; , &quot; but also ad@@ mits that &quot; &quot; course &quot; &quot; is missing . &quot;
the most heavily exploited are the local spots along the road .
&quot; J.@@ Albert G@@ öh@@ ner , owner of Ste@@ ak@@ house , formerly Crown , finds clear words . &quot;
this is already exist@@ ential .
&quot; not only him , but all the restaurants &quot; &quot; hit hard &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; customers were missing from H@@ ech@@ ingen , Bal@@ ingen and Rot@@ t@@ weil . &quot;
we have to be happy about every euro turnover .
&quot; at &quot; &quot; far more than 50 percent &quot; , &quot; the sales revenue is reduced to &quot; &quot; more than 50 percent . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; street renovation has dropped its operation &quot; &quot; by two years . &quot;
he has to release half of his staff .
&quot; if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been dismissed , politics would have responded differently . &quot;
&quot; instead , Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by G@@ öh@@ ner , whether there could be a financial compensation , the restaurant otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27 . &quot;
G@@ öh@@ ner knows from other coun@@ ties where something more generous is handled .
&quot; with all complaints , G@@ öh@@ ner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist . &quot;
&quot; after all , the family business has been settled here since 17@@ 15 , but refers to the long history . &quot;
&quot; that other regul@@ ars now look less frequently due to complicated traffic guidance , he can understand . &quot;
&quot; if you cannot approach it , it is also somewhere else beautiful . &quot;
&quot; after the renovation work , G@@ öh@@ ner has no doubts . &quot;
&quot; despite the crises with BSE and bird flu , G@@ öh@@ ner holds the effects of the B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long @-@ standing history . &quot;
&quot; six months of construction work , which is already brutal . &quot;
&quot; in the name of fighting terrorism , laws are constantly being ro@@ uted . &quot;
&quot; following the latest proposals , Interior Minister de Mai@@ zi@@ ère now presents a thick security package . &quot;
but what has a tolerance status to do with terror ?
and what does the coalition partner say to all of this ?
Thomas de Mai@@ zi@@ ère gives the Vers@@ ati@@ er .
&quot; all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner , &quot; says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package . &quot;
they don &apos;t overwhel@@ m anyone .
&quot; other , further points would initially be discussed within the parties . &quot;
I also took part in this .
&quot; but as the Minister of the Interior , however , he was located on results and at a &quot; &quot; achiev@@ able consensus &quot; &quot; within the Coalition . &quot;
&quot; after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère has left a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic . &quot;
but these are all the more extensive .
&quot; some things are already known , announced , announced : that a new security authority should take care of the cra@@ cking of encrypted communication is not new . &quot;
also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU directives on passenger data and tru@@ ce rights .
the call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising .
&quot; in part , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère starts a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD : he wants to raise sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and kno@@ ck jihadi@@ sts with double citizenship to the German passport . &quot;
&quot; this will be difficult points for the SPD , &quot; the CD@@ U ad@@ mits . &quot;
&quot; he nevertheless considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything , which in the coalition partner doesn &apos;t have any chance anyway . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère presented some new ideas too .
they have partly in themselves : he plans quick methods for deport@@ ations and more possibilities for the incar@@ cer@@ ation of people before deportation .
refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security audit .
&quot; in the case of toler@@ ances for rejected asylum seekers , he wants to make some worse than until now - such as comm@@ itting crimes or deliberately throwing their papers out in order to disgu@@ ise their identity . &quot;
some of them are politically and legally sanc@@ tu@@ aries .
some even seem un@@ qualified and leaves questions un@@ answered .
&quot; and with some points - in the im@@ balance of tolerated ones , for example - the question arises : what has this actually to do with security and terror ? &quot;
&quot; yes , says de Mai@@ zi@@ ère , it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror . &quot;
but it cannot be argued that the attacks of Ans@@ bach and Wu@@ erz@@ burg were refugees .
&quot; in addition , many people were worried about security in view of the high refugees . &quot;
&quot; and things that people deeply occupied , did not let themselves be cl@@ inging to election campaign times . &quot;
the inner security has greatly moved into focus .
&quot; only the stops in the neighborhood : Paris , Copenhagen , Brussels , Nice . &quot;
then the attacks in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach .
the uncertainty is great .
&quot; and yes , there are electoral campaigns . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , the Union and the SPD are increasingly in their position on the subject of internal security . &quot;
&quot; in the past few days , there was a high level between the two parties . &quot;
&quot; only a tent@@ ative argument about the equi@@ pping of the Federal Police , then a security policy collection of some Uni@@ ons interior ministers , in which the chiefs also demand a burst of bur@@ ka and a ren@@ unciation of dual citizenship . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is also struggling here for conci@@ li@@ atory sounds .
&quot; from a return from the double pass , he doesn &apos;t consider anything . &quot;
we have fixed the discussion in Germany .
to recre@@ ate it is not useful .
&quot; and with a bur@@ ka ban , he has constitutional concerns . &quot;
whether its own package is un@@ constitutional in all corners and whether it is actually &quot; reasonable &quot; for the coalition partner only has to show itself .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot in it , which could cause quar@@ rels . &quot;
but the SPD is also trying to pro@@ actively shape itself on the subject of internal security .
&quot; party leader Sig@@ mar Gabriel only once again signals the willingness to talk and says : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Volkswagen comes off lightly . &quot;
&quot; in spite of diesel sc@@ and@@ als , the delivery figures are rising worldwide . &quot;
but not all markets are running smoothly .
&quot; in the recall campaign , vor@@ ti@@ ces are about a term . &quot;
Volkswagen will start the deliveries in the second half of the year .
&quot; despite its many brands and some well @-@ running markets , Europe &apos;s largest car manufacturer can continue to boast a plus in spite of its many brands and some well @-@ running markets . &quot;
&quot; however , in July , the core brand was weaker , especially in Western Europe , and thus again loaded the total sales , as reported by the company in the D@@ ax . &quot;
&quot; in July , the VW brand , which sold 44@@ 9@@ 100 cars , sold 1.8 percent fewer vehicles than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; in Western Europe alone , after China the second most important market , sales were 14 percent below the prior @-@ year figure . &quot;
&quot; in the home market of Germany , deliveries declined by almost one sixth . &quot;
&quot; brand sales manager Jürgen St@@ ack@@ mann brought back the weaker figures from July , mainly on two sales days less in Europe . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in some core markets , there has been a purchase balance due to &quot; changed economic conditions . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the situation around the coup attempt in Turkey , the British V@@ ot@@ um also bur@@ dened the EU &apos;s exit from the EU , explained a spokes@@ woman . &quot;
&quot; in the USA , where the exhaust has escal@@ ated first , a minus is also added . &quot;
big support for VW is the Chinese market .
&quot; all in all , the mainly affected family brand in Lower Saxony already got off lightly with the diesel sc@@ andal : after the first seven months there is only one extra@@ dition minus of 0.@@ 9 percent to 3.@@ 37 million vehicles . &quot;
group sales chief Fred Kap@@ pler was able to further notice a sales division from January to July .
&quot; at this time , Volkswagen delivered 1.3 percent more vehicles , worldwide 5,@@ 9@@ 04 million . &quot;
Volkswagen had manipul@@ ated exhaust tests with a software .
&quot; in Germany alone , VW is calling around 2.5 million vehicles for retro@@ fitting in the workshops . &quot;
&quot; in the course of retro@@ fitting , Volkswagen reiter@@ ated that the conversion of cars has no negative impact . &quot;
&quot; after retro@@ fitting the vehicles , there is no deterioration in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance . &quot;
&quot; the car wall gives customers a &quot; guaranteed &quot; certificate after the conversion , but don &apos;t speak of a &quot; guarantee &quot; as it was called on Friday in corporate travel . &quot;
reason is legal sub@@ t@@ le@@ ties .
&quot; the &quot; Focus , &quot; reported that Volkswagen won its German customers with a guarantee for sc@@ aff@@ ol@@ ding diesel models . &quot;
this would have confirmed VW representatives in the Federal Ministry of Transport last Monday .
&quot; from the Ministry of Transport , it was confirmed that there was this meeting . &quot;
VW was able to fulfil the requirements of my Insp@@ ection Commission and the KBA .
&quot; deviations from this are not accepted , &quot; declared Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) according to the Ministry . &quot;
&quot; VW has taken over the guarantee that no deterior@@ ations in fuel consumption , CO2 emissions or engine performance will not take place after the conversion and all type @-@ approved vehicle values remain unchanged . &quot;
&quot; Volkswagen itself uses the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; &quot; but not as it was called in corporate travel . &quot;
&quot; with the wide term &quot; guarantee , &quot; Volkswagen sees the possibility for customers to come to a workshop for example six months after the conversion - and this can result in the new software even if the damage has nothing to do with it . &quot;
&quot; in customer interest , it is important to avoid the fact that any other damage that has nothing to do with the sc@@ andal may result in uncertainty about possible warranty regulations , as it was said . &quot;
&quot; therefore , VW does not use the term &quot; &quot; guarantee &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund am T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see demands sufficient savings in the future - as a second institute in Germany .
&quot; Mr. Josef Paul said on Thursday : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s just about 139 customers who park 40 million euros on sight or day @-@ to @-@ day accounts . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Association of German B@@ anks speaks of a single case and does not see it as a signal : &quot; &quot; normal savers don &apos;t have to fear &quot; &quot; to pay for their austerity measures . &quot;
&quot; if banks store money overnight at the European Central Bank ( ECB ) , they have to pay their 0.4 percent penalty . &quot;
&quot; this fee will return the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank G@@ mund from September by private and corporate clients for deposits of more than € 100,000 on sight deposits or day @-@ to @-@ day accounts . &quot;
&quot; the first 100,000 euros are free . &quot;
&quot; the next 100,000 will in future cost 400 euros a year , &quot; &quot; said Paul . &quot;
&quot; for some time now , he has kept 40 million euros , which could be lifted from one day to the other and which he cannot evaluate . &quot;
&quot; they lie with me on the central bank account and cause a cost of 0.4 percent , &quot; &quot; said the Head of the Bank . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I can &apos;t lay down for every million Euro . &quot;
&quot; according to the pol@@ lu@@ ter principle , the costs now continue . &quot;
&quot; to leave the cash in the v@@ aults of the Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank would be too dangerous : &quot; &quot; I have already experienced four ra@@ ids , I don &apos;t like the fifth ! &quot; , &quot; said the Bank Chief Financial Officer . &quot;
most customers would have understanding and changed to other forms of investment .
few mig@@ rated to other banks .
&quot; the Co@@ operatives Union of Bavaria declared : &quot; &quot; the ECB &apos;s extreme monetary policy causes considerable costs in all banks . &quot;
&quot; to carry it alone , be &quot; economically viable . &quot; &quot;
&quot; some German banks have therefore increased their fees for account management , credit cards or transfers . &quot;
&quot; with pen@@ alties for deposits from three million euros , the Thurin@@ gian People &apos;s and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ bank Alten@@ burger Land had made head@@ lines with its 2014 Sk@@ at@@ bank branch in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; Michael Kem@@ mer , head of the Banking Union , said : &quot; &quot; we do not expect private clients to pay nationwide charges for deposits , the competition in Germany under banks and savings banks is far too strong . &quot;
&quot; a ban@@ ker said that at T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see there is &quot; &quot; a clientele that is somewhat more abund@@ antly equipped . &quot;
this can become a problem for a small bank if it is free of charge .
&quot; founded in 1911 , G@@ mund has branches in Bad Wies@@ see , Rot@@ t@@ ach @-@ E@@ gern , Kre@@ uth and T@@ eg@@ ern@@ see . &quot;
&quot; well @-@ known actors , athletes and entrepreneurs are living in the region . &quot;
&quot; there are currently no other banks known to the &quot; &quot; Co@@ operative Association of Bavaria &quot; , &quot; which calculate an extension for deposits by private customers , &quot; &quot; said spokes@@ man Ernst . &quot;
&quot; the President of the Federal Association of German Volks@@ banks and Rai@@ ff@@ ei@@ sen@@ banks ( Bv@@ R ) , Uwe Fr@@ öh@@ lich , had explained at the end of June : &quot; the Thr@@ es@@ hold , to go into the Neg@@ ative vis @-@ à @-@ vis the private customer , is very , very high . &quot;
competition is tough and it is threatening the emig@@ ration of investors to competition .
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
destination Pl@@ ates : who actually bu@@ ys vinyl records ?
lonely men middle @-@ aged love plates .
&quot; before you rush to the comments section to see him under the pseu@@ don@@ ym Non@@ aven@@ ue men &apos;s middle age with rough insul@@ ts , this statement is derived from current data . &quot;
&quot; according to You@@ Go@@ v , the much discussed resurrection of records is not limited to a boom in mill@@ enni@@ als that want to welcome the new@@ ness of physical objects , but to Mid@@ life @-@ nostal@@ gia . &quot;
those who recently bought a record are all for@@ esi@@ ght after the age between 45 and 54 .
&quot; in fact , the age group of 18 @-@ 24 is the most unlikely buyer group . &quot;
it is also not a hor@@ de through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning : older record buyers are more likely to retain their feelings ( 56 % vs. 53 % ) and enjoy spending time alone ( 69 % vs. 66 % ) .
but are the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote ?
&quot; if this blog was a news report on TV , the camera would follow me while I run in Soh@@ o in the middle of a busy street , hold a modest gray suit before I steal , hold my hands and say something stupid like : &quot; &quot; so , let &apos;s take a closer look at it . &quot;
&quot; so , let &apos;s take a look at it . &quot;
&quot; even if the heart of Soh@@ o is slowly lost in its charm - hotels , restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which independent vendors were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops . &quot;
I would probably ask the cam@@ er@@ aman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation .
&quot; Glasgow , 55 , whom I follow from Si@@ ster Ray ( number of data : two young women , three middle @-@ aged men ) into Rec@@ kl@@ ess Records ( number of numbers : eight men middle @-@ aged , a woman , probably around 20 ) , is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours . &quot;
&quot; is he a collector , I ask ? &quot;
&quot; I guess , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; I have about 3,000 or 4,000 disks . &quot;
&quot; these records , pic@@ tured above ( he sent me the snapshot by e @-@ mail , I did not follow him home ) , cl@@ ot@@ he the walls of his living room . &quot;
&quot; the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income : he is now able to buy records he could not afford , when they appeared and bought items he sold when he was young and broke . &quot;
&quot; many things I buy are from the late 60s , early 70s , which appeared when I was 11 or 12 . things I probably have been a little too young to buy them , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; he agrees that those who buy records are rather intro@@ ver@@ ted and gladly spend time alone , and adds : &quot; I don &apos;t smoke and I don &apos;t drink a lot . &quot;
this is my vice .
&quot; WE@@ Z , 25 , who works at Si@@ ster Ray , also believes that many customers , whom he meets , apply to the You@@ Go@@ v profile . &quot;
&quot; however , he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media , people who heard about the com@@ eback and are prompted to buy their old records . &quot;
&quot; from the conversations that I have led , people usually get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999 . &quot;
&quot; customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records , &quot; he says . &quot;
this would explain the boom of supporters of the record revi@@ vals of a certain age .
but what about the alleged emotional meaning of records ?
&quot; it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Ph@@ onica , to see that record business offers a cal@@ ming community of like @-@ minded people . &quot;
&quot; according to We@@ z , some of the older customers contacted the cont@@ act@@ less payment system . &quot;
&quot; some record fans feel overwhel@@ med by the digital world and want to withdraw themselves to the stability of familiar record sleeves , from items that evoke happy memories . &quot;
&quot; I think , sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort , &quot; says We@@ z . &quot;
this is the case with me as a collector and I think that it is so with many people .
it is a simple way to deal mentally .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we are like their social workers ! &quot; &quot; an employee dies off a record pile . &quot;
&quot; a pol@@ l of the IC@@ M in April revealed that almost 50 % of the people who bought a record last month , did not yet listen to it . &quot;
&quot; the survey also found that 41 % have a record player they never use , whereas 7 % of those who buy a record don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; at this time of the news report , I would probably look very worried as I browse through a stack of Bos@@ sa Nova comp@@ il@@ ations . &quot;
&quot; Jon@@ ny , 42 , who works at Sounds of the Universe ( Number of Number : three men middle @-@ aged ) has noticed a &quot; &quot; tro@@ phy aspect &quot; &quot; of the Revi@@ val . &quot;
&quot; someone just came here and said , &quot; I don &apos;t own a record player , but I &apos;d like to buy a Radi@@ oh@@ ead Record , so that I can put it on the shelf , &quot; he says . &quot;
&quot; this is not a big percentage , but it definitely happens . &quot;
&quot; more produc@@ t@@ less , less playing music . &quot;
we have people saying : &quot; I don &apos;t have a record player . &quot;
&quot; these are younger people , not older ones who only enter slowly . &quot;
&quot; F@@ op@@ p , which has dedicated the records to almost a whole floor , has a colorful audience when I go in . &quot;
&quot; there are couples around 70 , tourists who make photos , teenagers and middle @-@ aged women . &quot;
even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above @-@ mentioned shops - Wild Be@@ asts &apos;s latest syn@@ th@@ esi@@ zer@@ - and sex@@ i@@ packed pop instead of experimental jazz mo@@ ans from the loud@@ speakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers .
&quot; none of them looks very lonely , but nag@@ ging psych@@ ic trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; E@@ lan@@ ora , 27 , has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale . &quot;
she rather makes a shop window than a big shopping .
&quot; it doesn &apos;t deserve much , so collecting records is not a real option , she says . &quot;
it costs a lot .
&quot; it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways , but the beauty of plates is ... &quot; &quot; she drives off with a de@@ ar@@ est si@@ gh . &quot;
I don &apos;t know how to explain it - it &apos;s really unique .
my last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of disk lovers : urban Out@@ fit@@ ters .
&quot; while I give the appearance of mu@@ stering the jeans hot@@ pants , I watch a group of young girls , who are grouped for a moment to group Pol@@ aro@@ id cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Cros@@ ley record player . &quot;
&quot; on the left there is a staircase , a wall full of plates of Adel@@ e , Jeff Buck@@ ley , A@@ my Win@@ ehouse and Fle@@ et@@ wood Mac : a mixture of contemporary music and classics , the essential plates for an average collection . &quot;
&quot; no one looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative , some so far above that it is impossible to touch them . &quot;
it is pure &quot; record art . &quot;
&quot; but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soh@@ o for more , there is nothing to complain about . &quot;
&quot; it is no surprise that a population group , who has more time and money than others , is also the one who spends most of the luxury items like plates . &quot;
&quot; even though my research revealed that the results of You@@ Go@@ v vote , they are ignored , at least in record stores in Soh@@ o , the large number of female collectors who exist in reality , record shops and online forums . &quot;
these people are probably working hard at school or in offices .
&quot; they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bum@@ ble@@ bees on the Ber@@ wick Street and the sheets through plates , while they steer clear of an un@@ cann@@ y , 30 @-@ year @-@ old false present@@ er who un@@ ra@@ vels over the shoulders of nothing of middle @-@ aged men . &quot;

French court re@@ jects offer on demo@@ lition of shops in the jungle refugee camp
&quot; a French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Cal@@ ais , dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Cal@@ ais where thousands of refugees live . &quot;
&quot; during a trial this week , the authorities in Cal@@ ais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which people within the camp sell goods , from cigar@@ ettes to erg@@ y@@ drinks , sell , hair@@ dressing services or sell tea for 50 c@@ ents ( 40 p@@ ence ) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants . &quot;
&quot; the f@@ ec@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais argued that these places should be torn down , because they would represent a parallel economy , from which no taxes would be paid and which contain fire and san@@ itation risks . &quot;
&quot; humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important , as the free meals offered by the state @-@ supported unification and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp . &quot;
they also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need .
&quot; a court in L@@ ille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expul@@ sion of people who operate the 72 temporary shops , but admitted that the concerns of the Pre@@ f@@ ecture of Cal@@ ais were absolutely in@@ comprehensible . &quot;
&quot; judge Jean @-@ François M@@ oll@@ a said that grocery stores , cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely nour@@ ishing people living in extremely prec@@ arious conditions . &quot;
he said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers .
&quot; one of the places that was threatened by the rain was the Jung@@ le Book Kids &apos; Café of the camp , which is operated in the community and offers 200 meals a day , English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of needy , un@@ accompanied min@@ ors in the camp . &quot;
more than 17@@ 0.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids &apos; Café .
&quot; in a letter to the Guardian it was said that &quot; &quot; closing &quot; &quot; would be a disaster for these children , of which the youngest eight years are old . &quot;
&quot; the two aid organizations Help Refu@@ ge@@ es and L &apos;@@ Au@@ berge des Mig@@ rants estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp has increased to more than 9@@ ,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase of newcom@@ ers during the summer . &quot;
despite Olympic disappointment : Martin remains fighting
&quot; despite his dis@@ ap@@ pointing performance in the Olympic pas@@ time , he doesn &apos;t want to stop Tony Martin . &quot;
&quot; I keep looking at the World Cup , stay confident and fight , &quot; &quot; wrote the 31 @-@ year @-@ old on Thursday before his departure from Rio de Janeiro on Facebook . &quot;
he has no explanation for his mis@@ erable twel@@ fth place on the sugar lo@@ af .
&quot; I honestly think it &apos;s hard to comment on the timing of yesterday , &quot; &quot; said Martin . &quot;
&quot; he had to analyse in peace , which reasons had led to the de@@ bac@@ le . &quot;
&quot; at the World Cup in October in Qatar , Martin wanted to fight for the title . &quot;
I will look at everything we have changed in recent times .

here comes the reinforcement trailer
&quot; Germany &apos;s rac@@ er must adapt to the next generation of speed knives : in various federal states , among others in Hessen and Brandenburg , new flas@@ hes are tested , which should be particularly effective . &quot;
&quot; the futur@@ istic acting reinforcement of Vit@@ ronic from Wiesbaden , for example , can be used for accident focal points , where it would be too dangerous for mobile measurement by the police . &quot;
&quot; for example , on highway construction sites or to rehabil@@ itating bridges with a temporary speed limit , there is often no need for infrastructure to ensure compliance with speed limits . &quot;
&quot; however , a permanent mobile construction can be too dangerous or costly . &quot;
&quot; the reinforcement trailer is self @-@ sufficient : its battery lasts five days with un@@ interrupted measuring operations , the case data are transmitted encrypted over a modem . &quot;
&quot; with laser measurement technology , all vehicles can also be captured across multiple tracks simultaneously . &quot;
&quot; variable speed limits as well as transit b@@ ans according to time , driving strips and vehicle class can also be monitored . &quot;
&quot; in the advanced state , the trailer can be moved by car with trailer hit@@ ch , according to the manufacturer . &quot;
&quot; so that it is not simply cl@@ amped , it is lowered in the measurement mode , so that the wheels in the ar@@ mor@@ ed and inci@@ dentally also a safe outer shell disappear . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a built @-@ in alarm system should protect the gl@@ itter from v@@ and@@ alism . &quot;
&quot; since 2015 , the trailer has been tested according to the values of Vit@@ ronic in various federal states and is now also used . &quot;
&quot; even foreign authorities flash with the new technique : recently , France has ordered 100 units , after an order of 150 pieces last year . &quot;
UK fet@@ ches silver in 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by after Fiji &apos;s Master@@ class Gold
Britain &apos;s impressive performance in the 7 @-@ year ru@@ g@@ by led to an ab@@ rupt halt in the last hur@@ dle in the form of Fi@@ j@@ is when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43 @-@ 7 at the de@@ odor@@ o Stadium .
&quot; Fiji divided a master class in the handling , side @-@ step@@ ping , back , line run , and raw power to win gold - its first Olympic medal in any colour . &quot;
&quot; defeat was missed by the not too bad consol@@ ation prize of the silver medal - Britain &apos;s fourth on that day - and they could be proud of their efforts in this tournament , in which they beat New Zealand , Argentina and South Africa . &quot;
&quot; the clear defeat of the Bo@@ ks , 7 @-@ 5 in the semi @-@ final on the same day could fall back on them in the final . &quot;
&quot; but , regardless of that , a 15 @-@ man team would have been defeated in this form . &quot;
&quot; it might be a consol@@ ation for UK - but probably it won &apos;t - that at least a Br@@ it tomorrow will have a gold medal for his neck : Fi@@ j@@ is &apos;s head coach Ben R@@ yan , the former boss for England from Wim@@ ble@@ don . &quot;
GB had a difficult path behind him .
&quot; eight years ago , she lost every game with Adel@@ ai@@ de Sev@@ ens in R@@ yan . &quot;
here they only lose one .
&quot; this hat@@ ch will hurt , but progress is amazing . &quot;
Fiji started amaz@@ ingly and ra@@ ced G@@ Bs from fun .
&quot; it felt like captain Tom Mit@@ ch@@ ell and Co . , as if they were running into running buses . the World Series winners went 5 @-@ 0 upwards , when O@@ sea Kol@@ in@@ is@@ au left in the corner . &quot;
&quot; with just four minutes of playing time , Jer@@ ry Tu@@ wa@@ i added another attack from the right @-@ hand corner . &quot;
12 @-@ 0 and GB hardly touched the ball .
&quot; a h@@ ul@@ led T@@ ackle from Mit@@ ch@@ ell stopped the mountain of Sierra Leone N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa to score a third goal , but it only stopped Fiji . &quot;
in the seventh minute ath@@ lete j@@ asa Ver@@ em@@ alu@@ a in the right corner a touch down and it stood 0 @-@ 17 for GB .
N@@ ak@@ ar@@ awa added a new member since the band and there was still more than a minute of playing time ... in the first half .
V@@ atem@@ o Rav@@ ou@@ vo@@ u pressed through further weak Tac@@ kl@@ ings of the UK team and stor@@ med up to the line to make a gate .
the conversion brought a 29 @-@ 0 to the break .
&quot; it is as if Fiji had been born to play 7 , while GB was still learning . &quot;
this is how it is .
GB led fundamental changes to half @-@ time and closed down the fi@@ ji@@ an gap ... for whole four minutes what was good for the conditions of the first half @-@ time until Joshua passed Tu@@ is@@ ova after a brilliant intermediate play of Fiji .
&quot; Dan Nor@@ ton launched an attempt for GB , made a touch down in the left corner for a 36 @-@ 7 , but the game went for a long time in favor of the South Sea sul@@ try whose fans sang , wa@@ ved flags and danced on the tri@@ b@@ une . &quot;
it was not difficult to admire the playful approach Fi@@ j@@ is .
Mat@@ a V@@ ili@@ ams put the icing on the cake with another try in the last seconds .
&quot; the whi@@ stle sounded , the fi@@ j@@ is hu@@ gged themselves and GB cr@@ ushing crushed in the lawn . &quot;
&quot; earlier on the day , Fiji had defeated Japan in the semi@@ fin@@ als with 20 @-@ 5 and Britain pressed South Africa in a short semi @-@ fin@@ al@@ match from the race - Britain &apos;s conversion of the difference . &quot;
&quot; K@@ yle Brown brought the Bo@@ ks forward in the first half , but Dan Nor@@ ton broke the line with an impressive foot@@ work and scored a gate among the posts in the second half . &quot;
&quot; a brilliant late tac@@ kling by Marcus Wat@@ son , brother of Anthony of the English 15 @-@ A@@ side team , secured the prize - and thus the silver medal . &quot;
Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning inspired by battle with the trainer &apos;s cancer
there will be no more em@@ ot@@ less gold than in these games and that &apos;s what they want .
&quot; from the first stroke to the last , 220 hard rock , who enter the history , Hel@@ en Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning found an additional meaning in their golden moment at Est@@ acio da Lag@@ oa . &quot;
&quot; the echo of the Train@@ ers Robin Williams , was all@@ ready when they rowed for the second Olympi@@ ag@@ old in two without a tax woman , the first women in the history of British Sports who set such a standard . &quot;
&quot; their domin@@ ance was absolutely , after all their 3@@ 9.@@ ter unused deployment , which is also unprecedented . &quot;
&quot; what we see are two brilliant female athletes , who gli@@ de over the surface with the elegance of sw@@ ans , which does not reflect the style of the trium@@ ph@@ al . &quot;
&quot; behind each gold in rowing there is a batt@@ ali@@ on of willing hel@@ pers who contribute to the incre@@ mental advances that make the difference , and no one was much easier than the coach who did not know whether he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer . &quot;
&quot; as he said , he ris@@ ked . &quot;
&quot; I had bladder cancer , which is oper@@ able and they did . &quot;
&quot; if you do not do that , he spreads everywhere . &quot;
it would have been a pretty terrible situation .
it changes a bit of the view .
Williams was diagnosed in December 2013 .
&quot; the trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014 , outside the season , which kept the inter@@ ruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances . &quot;
&quot; I needed money , so I had to go better soon . &quot;
it was an incentive .
&quot; I was hospit@@ alized and ran around the station - 20 feet , 30 feet , 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suff@@ ice . &quot;
that is how it begins .
&quot; the rowing in itself is a challenge , but that makes it an even bigger one . &quot;
&quot; in the immedi@@ acy of victory , their first thoughts went to Williams , who spent a nerve wre@@ aking morning doing something more than usual , trying to process his own fears . &quot;
&quot; p@@ anning , who was the captain of the Royal Arti@@ llery Regi@@ ment in a deployment in Afghanistan , said , &quot; &quot; I was an emotional w@@ reck this week . it &apos;s a bit extreme , but it means so much . &quot;
&quot; it just repe@@ ats how much I mean , how much I and Hel@@ en and Robin have worked . &quot;
there were three fantastic years with Hel@@ en and Robin .
&quot; without Robin we would be no one , so a massive thank you to him . he is the best trainer in the world . &quot;
I couldn &apos;t have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer .
Helena Glo@@ ver and He@@ ather St@@ anning have not lost a race over the last five years .
the couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents couldn &apos;t keep up .
&quot; even in the last 500 meters , when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up , St@@ anning and Glo@@ ver had too much in reserve . &quot;
we were caught very at the moment .
&quot; Hel@@ en called &quot; &quot; stay in the process , stay in the process . &quot; &quot; &quot;
it is really important not to let yourself be carried away .
we had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something great .
&quot; we didn &apos;t want a fire@@ works today , we just wanted to get a good result , go out and win the race , which we did . &quot;
the couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future .
&quot; Glo@@ ver must appear next week on a wedding , their own with the TV advent@@ urer Steve Back@@ shall . &quot;
now she just wants to enjoy the moment .
I didn &apos;t want to say that this was my last race .
that would have meant too much pressure .
&quot; in London , it took about six months to understand that I am an Olympic champion . &quot;
it was all so new for me and I was so stressed .
it took about four minutes .
&quot; that feels so much better , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
for 31 years exemplary for clarity
&quot; the managing director of the &quot; V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein Group , &quot; Rup@@ pert G@@ öller , reti@@ res . &quot;
&quot; the association is considered &quot; &quot; Bavarian &quot; &quot; exemplary . &quot;
a small con@@ serving drinking water tank as a model for the large water producers .
this was the name of the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk some time ago .
little later the water forum of the Government of Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia praised the purpose association .
&quot; the work of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , &quot; bay@@ ern far as exemplary . &quot; &quot;
&quot; behind all this is Ru@@ pert G@@ eller , who was in the Emplo@@ ye@@ es &apos; Association for 31 years , of which 28 years as Managing Director . &quot;
&quot; at the age of 65 , he was retired in retirement . &quot;
&quot; the drinking water @-@ purpose association of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group , based in Kot@@ ten@@ dorf , municipality of Breit@@ brunn , promotes annually about 150@@ ,000 cubic metres of water and provides 32 places and hamlet with about 5@@ 500 inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; the municipalities are the municipalities of Kirch@@ berg , Breit@@ brunn , Lau@@ ter , E@@ bel@@ s@@ bach and the City of Ba@@ un@@ ach . &quot;
there are water supply contracts for other cities and municipalities .
&quot; the current chair@@ woman , Breit@@ brunn mayor Ger@@ tru@@ d Büh@@ l ( F@@ W ) , reminded that Ru@@ pert G@@ eller was appointed as a water atten@@ dant in 1985 and was appointed General Manager of the Con@@ federation in 1988 . &quot;
&quot; his tasks have been very diverse , ranging from water management and maintenance work to office and organisation activities , budget@@ ing planning , fees and fees up to emergency interventions on weekends , &quot; &quot; said the chairman . &quot;
&quot; as an outstanding event , she called the start @-@ up and inauguration of the new fountain ( 1994 ) , land purchases in the area of the new wells ( 1998 ) and compensation of farmers , the renovation of the high reservoir ( 1999 ) , the new acquisition of a central computer control system ( 2004 ) and the development of water pipes . &quot;
there has been no stand@@ still and I have always added improvements because water is life and drinking water is the most important food .
&quot; in her lau@@ dati@@ o she praised Gö@@ ll@@ ers faithful , reliable and correct service over 31 years . &quot;
&quot; he has worked with a lot of heart blood for his water @-@ purpose association , and he literally lived the water @-@ purpose association as if it were his own company . &quot;
&quot; a few weeks ago , as a real practitioner , he was allowed to present the success concept of the V@@ ei@@ ten@@ stein group for nit@@ rate reduction in front of the water forum of the Lower Fran@@ con@@ ia . &quot;
for this he received a lot of recognition and praise .
&quot; Ru@@ pert G@@ eller , for his part , praised the Ste@@ wart Al@@ f@@ ons G@@ rie@@ bel , who worked with him for 28 years . &quot;
he is the best water go@@ al@@ keeper and he was a loyal boy .
together we were an unbe@@ atable team .
&quot; as highlights from his point of view , he described the foundation of the fountain and the restructuring of the ken@@ nel . &quot;
&quot; the biggest challenge and the har@@ dest use , however , were the rup@@ ture at the high reservoir at Kirch@@ hoff on a third of January . &quot;
&quot; here , at minus 17 degrees the whole night had to work , so that the villages could be supplied with water . &quot;
also the supply of Neu@@ brunn can only be maintained because one filled the high reservoir of P@@ ett@@ stadt with hoses .
the management of the drinking water @-@ purpose association was handed over to Daniel Stür@@ mer from Lau@@ ter who succ@@ eeds Ru@@ pert G@@ öller .

Rel@@ ation@@ ship in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de - man shoots on a partner of life
a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man shot in a multi @-@ family house in Bar@@ g@@ t@@ eh@@ ei@@ de ( Stor@@ mar@@ n district ) on Friday and injured her deadly .
&quot; the man called himself by us and stated to have shot his partner , &quot; &quot; said a police spokesperson . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ator is on the run , and after him will be punished publicly . &quot;
meanwhile Sven S. could be on the road with the car .
&quot; the man is about 1.@@ 80 meters tall , muscular , brown @-@ burned and has a bald . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the police have published a photo of him . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a few years old . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the man is wearing a bald . &quot;
the man is not to be addressed directly .
&quot; he could still carry the weapon with him , so the police . &quot;
those who see Sven S. should call the 110 .
the police talk about a &quot; relationship . &quot;
&quot; the victim was born in 1988 , the perpetr@@ ator in 1981 . &quot;
&quot; at first , the responsible police in Lü@@ beck did not want to provide information about the Ta@@ vern or the relationship between perpetr@@ ators and victims , but confirmed that a human being had been killed . &quot;
&quot; this is a killing crime . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; we don &apos;t say more at this time , &quot; said a police spokesperson in Lü@@ beck . &quot;
&quot; according to eye witnesses , a special application command ( SE@@ K ) was at the scene . &quot;
steel - Licht@@ blick for German Steel Industry
the crisis @-@ torn and energy @-@ intensive German steel industry is spar@@ ed from additional costs in the millions .
&quot; financial burdens , which the branch from the green economy threatened , are from the table . &quot;
&quot; it remains in the release of the Renew@@ able Energy Reg@@ ulations in the existing plants for so @-@ called self @-@ power production in the German steel industry , said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs , Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) of the &quot; West@@ deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung &quot; ( WA@@ Z , Friday issue ) . &quot;
I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations .
&quot; the European Commission , therefore , initially planned to ask steel manufacturers that use gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption . &quot;
&quot; according to the German industry association , the steel industry has threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year . &quot;
&quot; Gabriel said the WA@@ Z , there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with competition Commissioner Mar@@ gre@@ the V@@ est@@ ager . &quot;
&quot; only once the generators in the steel works are replaced , an EEG lev@@ y of 20 percent . &quot;
but this also does not rise in the steel industry .
IG Metall welcomed Germany &apos;s agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation .
&quot; in this way , the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined . &quot;
the successful effort made by Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance .
&quot; with regard to our &quot; steel is future , &quot; this is a first step . &quot;
&quot; more must follow . &quot;
&quot; even in the case of re@@ forming the issue of emissions legislation , climate and employment objectives are to be weighed , &quot; stated IG Metall @-@ Chief Jörg Hof@@ mann in Frankfurt . &quot;
the steel industry in Europe has been suffering from over@@ capacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008 .
&quot; last year , the situation was ag@@ grav@@ ated when the world &apos;s largest producer of producers cast steel on the world market in view of the weaker domestic demand . &quot;
European manufacturers are throwing price dump@@ ing in Chinese steel corporations .
&quot; in the course of this spring , the situation has somewhat relaxed . &quot;
&quot; on the one hand , imposed import duties on import steel effects , on the other hand , the economic prospects in China have brigh@@ tened up . &quot;
it is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is .
the German industry pri@@ mus Th@@ ys@@ senk@@ ru@@ pp was cau@@ tious on Thursday .
&quot; last but not least , prices would have stagn@@ ated again . &quot;
the industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions .
&quot; last but not least , Th@@ ys@@ sen@@ Krupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works . &quot;
around 8@@ 6000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015 .
&quot; in July , despite rising prices and increasing orders , German steel manufacturers are cau@@ tious . &quot;
&quot; with 3.4 million tonnes , they produced a good six percent lower crude steel than in the previous year &apos;s month , as the economic unification of steel reported on Friday . &quot;
&quot; after a short increase in May , the produced quantity went back the second month in a row . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , production has been around two percent below the previous year &apos;s figure . &quot;
&quot; in the coming months , the association expects an improved order situation with an increase in output . &quot;
&quot; community , spirit , health : singing does sen@@ iors good &quot;
&quot; singing has accompanied Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp her whole life : as a young girl she was in the school choir , she studied music and today the 78 @-@ year @-@ old sings in a sen@@ iors @-@ choir . &quot;
&quot; sing moves me - emotion@@ ally and physically , &quot; she describes . &quot;
&quot; after a rehear@@ sal , she feels balanced , cheerful and a total livel@@ ier , she says . &quot;
&quot; by the way , she does something good for her health and her mind . &quot;
&quot; S@@ ingen is from several perspectives a great hobby for sen@@ iors , says Er@@ hard H@@ ac@@ kler of the Deutsche Seni@@ or@@ en@@ liga . &quot;
&quot; most sen@@ iors sing in the choir and share with like @-@ minded people the joy of music , describes H@@ ac@@ kl@@ ers . &quot;
regular interaction enables sen@@ iors to soci@@ alize and maintain social contacts .
&quot; often social and family structures dissolve in old age , a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people . &quot;
&quot; this experience also made Ur@@ sel Ki@@ pp in her choir : &quot; &quot; to speak and organise , to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together . &quot;
&quot; singing can be stren@@ uous in the positive sense , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
for thereby sen@@ iors train a deep and controlled breathing .
those who regularly demand their lungs are not so fast in everyday life as quickly as possible .
&quot; even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at old age , singing is an ideal hobby . &quot;
&quot; on older people , singing often has a very special effect , says Ursula L@@ enz from the German Federal Association of Senior Ci@@ tiz@@ ens . &quot;
&quot; in the older generations , joint singing had a much higher significance , it belonged to everyday life , both in school and leisure , she explains . &quot;
&quot; L@@ enz often observed that singing or listening to songs in older people ar@@ ouses a lot of memories , often associated with positive feelings of their youth . &quot;
lyrics and especially melodies dev@@ ote themselves to long @-@ lying events themselves .
&quot; in singing , the head is also required to perform a special performance , explains L@@ enz . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , focus on one &apos;s own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge . &quot;
&quot; just elderly people , who live alone , do not only practice concentrating on themselves . &quot;
&quot; another positive aspect is the recognition obtained through singing in the choir , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
an enthusiastic audience is a great praise .
the self @-@ esteem also grows through singing in the choir .
&quot; to show oneself : if I have been for something for a long time , I will be better and wa@@ ver over me - this experience strengthens . &quot;
&quot; good reasons to start singing , there is enough . &quot;
&quot; if you want to try out a new hobby , you should not hesitate - even if you think you have little talent , L@@ enz recommends . &quot;
&quot; you don &apos;t sing alone - with 50 singing people , who sounds there when a sound goes wrong ? &quot;
&quot; in search of the right offer , senior citizens have different options , says H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
&quot; if someone is singing from the circle of acquain@@ tan@@ ces in a senior choir , one can easily join . &quot;
many cities also offer over@@ views of the choirs in the surrounding area .
those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader .
many sen@@ iors can also be found via the Internet .
&quot; if you don &apos;t have access to the Internet , the family , friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet search . &quot;
&quot; those who want to sing , should necessarily join a choir , advises H@@ ac@@ kler . &quot;
singing does the soul sing well and has something liber@@ ating - that applies to all ages .
cats react more sensi@@ tively than males on cries of young animals
bi@@ ologists have investigated in Hanover which effect the calling of cat babies has on adult animals .
&quot; to her surprise , the mi@@ dge did not let the males get cold - however , they always beha@@ ved the same in contrast to the females . &quot;
female cats can recognize the degree of arous@@ al of cat babies at the mi@@ str@@ um of the little ones .
&quot; they react by ten percent faster to Lau@@ te von K@@ ätz@@ chen , who choose to be in great need , as scientists from the Veter@@ inary University and the Medical School of Hannover ( MH@@ H ) have found out . &quot;
&quot; han@@ go@@ vers also react to the calls of k@@ itt@@ ens - however , always the same . &quot;
&quot; apparently the acoustic differences between the mi@@ str@@ ust of less and strongly excited young are either not percep@@ tible or not of importance for the males , &quot; &quot; said Bi@@ ologist Wi@@ eb@@ ke Kon@@ er@@ ding at MH@@ H . &quot;
she is the author of the study published this Friday in the journal &quot; BM@@ C Evol@@ ution@@ ary Biology . &quot;
&quot; in a previous examination , the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the k@@ itt@@ ens were different with the ur@@ gency of their dependency . &quot;
nine adult males and eight female bi@@ bs were observed from the animal hus@@ band@@ ry of MH@@ H .
&quot; they were played for a row of little ones , taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from the mother and si@@ bl@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , they were confronted with scre@@ ams of stronger excited k@@ itt@@ ens , which were raised in addition . &quot;
the researchers keep their results conclu@@ sive despite the low sample .
&quot; all females , even those who had not had their own offspring , re@@ acted to the scre@@ ams , &quot; &quot; said Kon@@ er@@ ding . &quot;
they turned faster to the loud@@ speakers when the sound of the very sub@@ lime k@@ itt@@ ens played .
this ability may be inn@@ ate or develop with the sexually mature .
&quot; a surprise was that the males have re@@ acted at all , &quot; &quot; said the bi@@ ologist . &quot;
&quot; in the past , scientists have already repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men on baby no@@ ises . &quot;
&quot; some studies showed that women re@@ acted more sensi@@ tively to infants , no matter if they were already mothers or not , bi@@ ologist Marina Sche@@ um@@ ann reported . &quot;
&quot; Po@@ dol@@ ski gra@@ bs with &quot; &quot; Gala &quot; &quot; to Super@@ cup &quot;
Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r is a football legend in Turkey .
&quot; in Turkey , an arrest warrant was issued against the former football star Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r . &quot;
he is accused of being a member of a terrorist group .
&quot; for the first time after the attempted put@@ sch , a major football game takes place in Turkey . &quot;
&quot; before the du@@ el of the arch @-@ riv@@ alling between Bes@@ ik@@ tas Istanbul and Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay , Istanbul , the official line is un@@ equi@@ vocal : &quot; business as usual . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the government , the everyday life of normal citizens , should not be affected by the suspension of the state of emergency after the fall arrest in July . &quot;
&quot; this does not apply to those suspected of belonging to the movement of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , responsible for the coup attempt . &quot;
the football doesn &apos;t stop even in front of football .
&quot; against the former strong i@@ cker Hak@@ an Sü@@ ku@@ r , the prosecution issued an arrest warrant . &quot;
&quot; according to this , the South American living in America is accused of being a member of a terrorist group . &quot;
&quot; Sü@@ ku@@ r is said to be a follow@@ er of the Pre@@ acher Fe@@ th@@ ul@@ lah Gü@@ len , who is bl@@ amed for the coup attempt by President Rec@@ ep Tay@@ yi@@ p Erdo@@ gan . &quot;
&quot; although the exception is valid for 90 days until October , the fact that most Turks do not have any effect on the lives of most Turks . &quot;
the ni@@ gh@@ tly &quot; democracy guards &quot; in public places throughout the country have declared Erdo@@ gan to end on Wednesday .
the sport is - like the whole country - divided into supporters and opponents of Erdo@@ gan .
especially fans of the club club Bes@@ ik@@ tas are traditionally not among the friends of the president .
&quot; but in the face of dramatic experiences in history , what unites the res@@ ent@@ ment of the Turks is the strict rejection of military put@@ ties . &quot;
even the fans agree - no matter if their heart beats for Gal@@ at@@ as@@ ar@@ ay or Bes@@ ik@@ tas .
&quot; at Pok@@ all@@ si@@ eger &quot; Gala , &quot; it will be especially arriving at Lukas Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; the Cologne in the past season proved its sporty value : with 17 goals and nine templates in all competitions , the 31 @-@ year @-@ old finished his first season as a top scor@@ er of his club . &quot;
in the final game against Fen@@ erb@@ ah@@ ce he achieved the 1 : 0 victory .
&quot; the newspaper &quot; &quot; FA@@ NA@@ TI@@ K &quot; &quot; che@@ ered him : &quot; &quot; he was the best in the place . &quot;
he finished the season in an excellent way and secured the tro@@ phy to his team .
&quot; thanks to &quot; Pol@@ di , &quot; the dis@@ ap@@ pointing season for the record champion was a conci@@ li@@ atory conclusion . &quot;
&quot; after the pre @-@ round K.@@ o in the Champions League , the &quot; &quot; Lion &quot; &quot; ki@@ cked off in the Europa League at an early stage . &quot;
&quot; in the South per Li@@ g , it was only six . &quot;
the season was not good .
the tro@@ phy was the only way to win something .
&quot; we have managed that and that is the most important thing , &quot; &quot; said Po@@ dol@@ ski . &quot;
for Master Bes@@ ik@@ tas the year was better .
&quot; especially thanks to Mario Gom@@ ez , who laid the base for the 14th title with 26 season figures as Sü@@ ver @-@ Li@@ g @-@ Tor@@ ment@@ aire King . &quot;
this is also the reason for the fans to continue to hope for the return of the 31 @-@ year @-@ old .
&quot; following the attempted coup attempt at the AC Florence , the Gom@@ ez had not been announced following the attempted coup attempt to return to the country after his EM @-@ holiday due to the political situation in the country . &quot;
&quot; if Mario wants to come to us , he must only say it , &quot; &quot; the magazine &quot; Ki@@ cker &quot; edited Fi@@ kre@@ t Or@@ man . &quot;
&quot; however , storms need to be willing to ren@@ ounce approximately one @-@ third of its annual consumption of 7.5 million euros , Or@@ man said : &quot; we cannot pay its salary at Florence . &quot;
despite D@@ oping : these athletes have even medals odds at Olympia in Rio
the 34 @-@ year @-@ old J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin was already twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 ) .
Rio de Janeiro - W@@ hist@@ le@@ blo@@ wer@@ in Julia Step@@ an@@ ova should not start in Rio .
other obsol@@ ete athle@@ tics s@@ inner can only laugh about it - they fight in Rio for medals .
the topic of dop@@ ing is still dominated by the head@@ lines at the Rio Olympics .
&quot; the Russian s@@ wimm@@ ers Juli@@ ja Je@@ fi@@ m@@ ova , who had compla@@ ined about their starting right shortly before the games after a dop@@ ing block , was pi@@ tied out mer@@ cil@@ essly at their start ( 100 meters chest ) . &quot;
it offered a bizarre scene : with a set smile she was still in the hall and provoked her performance .
&quot; as a point of fact , that they won &apos;t get gold , the audience broke out into a rush storm . &quot;
&quot; but there are many other sports@@ men , who go to the start despite the D@@ oping past at the Rio Olympics . &quot;
here is an overview :
&quot; J@@ ustin Gat@@ lin ( 100 , 200 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ Staff@@ el / USA ) : the 34 @-@ year @-@ old is one of the most controversial figures in athle@@ tics . &quot;
he was already locked twice because of dop@@ ing ( 2001 and 2006 until 2010 ) .
&quot; the Olympic champion of 2004 and ex @-@ World Champion has been running even faster than before , with over 100 m in 9.@@ 80 seconds the number one in the world and is regarded as the greatest chall@@ enger of U@@ sa@@ in Bol@@ t . &quot;
&quot; Shel@@ ly @-@ Ann Fr@@ aser @-@ Pr@@ yce ( 100 , 4x@@ 100 @-@ m @-@ season / Jam@@ ai@@ ka ) : the two @-@ time Olympic champion and seven times world champion had to sit on a six @-@ month block@@ lock after their intake of the pain using Ox@@ y@@ co@@ don was detected . &quot;
&quot; after an operation , I had severe to@@ ot@@ ha@@ che , the 29 @-@ year @-@ old defended . &quot;
&quot; Sandra Per@@ kovic ( Dis@@ us / Croatia ) : in 2011 , the 2012 Olympic Champion was tested positively for the banned stimul@@ ant drug meth@@ yl@@ hex@@ an@@ amin from 2010 to 2016 . &quot;
Per@@ kovic denied the accepted intake and was bar@@ red for six months .
the four fur@@ th@@ est lit@@ ters this year go to the account of the great gold favorite .
&quot; Sha@@ wn Mer@@ ritt ( 200 , 400 , 4x@@ 400 @-@ m @-@ season / USA ) : the Peking Olympic champion and two @-@ time world champion of over 400 m , had been tested positive in 2010 and locked for 21 months . &quot;
&quot; a means of penis enlargement was responsible , em@@ itted mer@@ ges . &quot;
&quot; this year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old is the fastest man in the world over 200 and 400 m . &quot;
&quot; Ivan T@@ ich@@ on ( Hammer@@ Fall , Belarus ) : hardly any ath@@ lete , so many medals were subsequently recognised . &quot;
thus T@@ ich@@ on lost his World Cup title of 2005 nine years later after it was established with him testosterone dop@@ ing .
the meanwhile 40 @-@ year @-@ old also had to release Olympia @-@ Silver 2004 because of ster@@ oid dop@@ ing and the EM title 2006 because of testosterone mis@@ use .
&quot; the bronze medal of the 2008 Olympic Games , which was also recognized by the International Sports Court of Sports , received him back in 2008 . &quot;
at 8@@ 0.@@ 04 m he ranks second in the world rank@@ ings .
&quot; Li@@ u Hong ( 20 km walking , China ) : the world record chan@@ cell@@ or and gold favorite was tested positively in May but may still start in Rio . &quot;
&quot; at the 29 @-@ year @-@ old world champi@@ onships , clu@@ es were found to take a banned dietary supplement , the blocking of the world anti @-@ dop@@ ing agency WA@@ DA fell mild and went off on July 13 . &quot;
bomb terror in Thailand - Austrian viol@@ ated - Sever@@ al dead
&quot; the Austrian Embassy in Thailand came into contact with the woman , said the spokes@@ man of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Thomas Schn@@ ö@@ ll , Friday morning . &quot;
&quot; she has suffered cuts and had been treated in the hospital , but have already left it . &quot;
she planned her home journey for the beginning of September .
&quot; whether from the further explo@@ sions on the island of Ph@@ u@@ ket as well as in the southern cities of Sur@@ at Th@@ ani , Ph@@ ang N@@ ga , Tran@@ g and Ch@@ um@@ phon , Austrian citizens are also affected . &quot;
&quot; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is in constant contact with the local authorities , so Schn@@ ö@@ ll . &quot;
&quot; at about 200 kilometres south of the capital of Bangkok , Hu@@ a H@@ in explo@@ ded two bombs on Thursday evening . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , a Thai woman was killed and about 20 people were injured , including the Austrian , three Germans , three Dut@@ ch@@ men and three Itali@@ ans . &quot;
&quot; on Friday morning two war@@ ships went up again , and another man was killed , according to the authorities . &quot;
&quot; also from Ph@@ u@@ ket , a bomb explosion was reported in the morning . &quot;
a taxi driver was injured when det@@ on@@ ating near the popular seaside resort of Pat@@ ong following police information .
&quot; in Sur@@ at Th@@ ani on the south @-@ eastern coast of the country , then another bomb explo@@ ded that killed a municipal employee . &quot;
&quot; according to the authorities , the explo@@ sives had gone into the air before the prec@@ inct of the coastal police . &quot;
&quot; finally , there were several det@@ on@@ ations in Ph@@ ang N@@ ga and Tran@@ g on the south @-@ west coast as well as in Ch@@ um@@ phon at the south @-@ east coast several injured . &quot;
&quot; from a connection with the explo@@ sions in Hu@@ a H@@ in , it was called it . &quot;
&quot; the bomb attacks carry the same signature , &quot; said Army General Dan@@ ai K@@ rit@@ meth@@ av@@ ee Friday morning before journalists . &quot;
we assume that this is a coordinated attack .
&quot; it is too early to express themselves to possible motives , but it is probably a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels . &quot;
Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bom@@ b@@ ings of Muslim separ@@ ati@@ sts in the south of the country .
&quot; the Thai police , on the other hand , declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islam@@ ist revolt or with international terrorism . &quot;
&quot; this is only local sab@@ otage , limited to limited areas and provinces , &quot; said a speaker in Bangkok . &quot;
&quot; rather , it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military jun@@ ta were laid . &quot;
&quot; in recent days , the authorities have kept secret warnings about upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places . &quot;
&quot; still , it is unclear which group is behind the attacks . &quot;
&quot; the police reported their officials across the country to enhance security around important government buildings as well as airports , train stations , tourist attractions , restaurants and entertainment districts . &quot;
&quot; in Thailand , there are always smaller bom@@ b@@ ings , but they are usually not directed against tourists . &quot;
in Hu@@ a H@@ in is a palace that was used over the years by Tha@@ il@@ ands King B@@ hum@@ i@@ bol Ad@@ ul@@ y@@ ade@@ j .
&quot; following the well @-@ known bomb explo@@ sions , the Austrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs is recommen@@ ding to follow the instructions of the Thai security authorities . &quot;
&quot; high security risk ( security level 3 ) applies to the provinces of Nar@@ ath@@ i@@ w@@ at , Y@@ ala , P@@ att@@ ani and Son@@ gh@@ kl@@ a as well as Pre@@ ah V@@ ih@@ ear and surroundings . &quot;
&quot; after disputes between the security forces and the Muslim populations , travel to these provinces is not necessary . &quot;
increased security risk ( security level 2 ) applies to the rest of the country .
the attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution dra@@ fted by the military jun@@ ta .
this gives the military great influence over the coming years .
&quot; Jun@@ ta boss and Prime Minister Pra@@ y@@ ut Ch@@ an @-@ o @-@ cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability , an improvement in the economic situation and tourism . &quot;
&quot; the military un@@ ta , which took power in 2014 after a phase of bloody un@@ rest , will benefit itself to restore the kingdom to stability and order . &quot;
&quot; however , the military has not managed to get a grip on the rebellion of Muslim rebels in the extreme south of the country . &quot;
more than 6@@ 500 people have already been killed in the conflict .
&quot; almost one year ago , a stop at a popular Hind@@ u shr@@ ine had been killed in Bangkok , most of them foreign tourists . &quot;
it was the bloo@@ dies@@ t attack of the recent history of the country .
the right &quot; identity movement &quot; has been targeted by the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection .
&quot; after several country offices , the constitutional prot@@ ectors in the Con@@ federation have also placed the group under observation . &quot;
&quot; in the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; , we see evidence of aspir@@ ations against the liberal democratic constitution , &quot; said S &amp; D MEP Hans @-@ Georg Ma@@ aß of the German press agency in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; thus , immigrants Islamic fai@@ ths or from the Middle East are treated in extrem@@ ist ways . &quot;
that is why we are watching the movement too .
the &quot; Identi@@ ty Movement &quot; is a group of French roots that have been active in Germany since 2012 .
&quot; it turns against &quot; multi@@ cul@@ tur@@ alism , &quot; &quot; un@@ controlled mass immigration , &quot; and the &quot; loss of one &apos;s own identity by alien@@ ation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; constitutional prot@@ ectors in nine federal states - Bremen , Bavaria , Hessen , Berlin , Baden @-@ Württemberg , NRW , Lower Saxony , Saxony and Thurin@@ gia - observe the &quot; identity &quot; already . &quot;
Ma@@ aß said that his authority was closely aligned with the State Off@@ ices in deciding on the decision .
&quot; groups such as the &apos; Identi@@ ty Movement &apos; are trying to pick up their target group where it stands , &quot; said the Supreme Court . &quot;
&quot; in general , extre@@ mi@@ sts try to address them with you@@ thful speech , often with p@@ opp@@ y music . &quot;
the fac@@ ul@@ ties of Islam@@ ists as well as right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts .
this is not an adverti@@ sed advertising for one &apos;s own thing .
the propaganda aims to appeal to people emotion@@ ally .
young people are particularly vulnerable .
this is dangerous .
&quot; last but not least , there have been reports of contacts of the &quot; &quot; identi@@ ties &quot; &quot; to Af@@ D politicians from several German states . &quot;
&quot; Ma@@ ate said , he didn &apos;t have any insights . &quot;
&quot; for the constitutional protection , possible contacts of this kind are only relevant from a certain point . &quot;
&quot; it depends on whether the party - in this case the Af@@ D - by certain individuals who are extrem@@ ist , changes its direction and become so extrem@@ ist . &quot;
the decisive factor is whether such people have a controlling influence on the party .
this is not recognis@@ able .
&quot; with a view to the significant increase in legitimate crimes and attacks on asylum seekers and refugee shel@@ ters , Ma@@ zen said he would not speak of new right terrorism in this connection . &quot;
but in recent years we have established that there can be legal @-@ terrorism structures .
there was the group &apos; Old School Society &apos; or the Frei@@ tal Group .
&quot; it may well be that other righ@@ tist groups or small groups form , plan attacks against asylum seekers , against refugee homes or attacks from other extrem@@ ist motives . &quot;
&quot; a nationwide or pan @-@ European control of terrorism , however , is not recognis@@ able . &quot;
the previous groups were created on the regional level or in social networks .
Ma@@ g said that many attacks on the account of people who had not appeared before in the right scene were concerned .
this is wor@@ rying .
&quot; many of the susp@@ ects in case of attacks on asylum shel@@ ters had not previously been known as criminals , politically motivated offen@@ ders or supporters of the right scene . &quot;
&quot; so many people have committed crimes that previously had nothing to do with right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts , perhaps politically in@@ different , or voted for example CD@@ U , SPD or Left , which , however , have radic@@ alized themselves by far @-@ right @-@ wing extre@@ mi@@ sts . &quot;
Rio 2016 : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te becomes Inter@@ ne@@ th@@ it
not always the Olympi@@ ans or world records determine the head@@ lines at the Olympic Games .
this shows the bold appearance of Ro@@ bel Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro .
&quot; in the Aqu@@ atics Center , the slightly overweight s@@ wimm@@ ers from Ethiopia slowly sw@@ am so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures at times . &quot;
it simply disappeared - no matter how far the cut@@ out was chosen .
&quot; in social networks , Hab@@ te was subsequently transformed into an inter@@ ne@@ th@@ ite . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the 24 @-@ year @-@ old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and reserved the 59@@ th place of 59 star@@ ters . &quot;
but it was rather his not just sporting figure that drew attention from the international media .
why the 24 @-@ year @-@ old still particip@@ ates in the Olympics ?
the Ethiop@@ ian got a special start right from the international swimming association .
this is distributed to make swimming in under@@ represented countries known .
&quot; since most athletes are running in Ethiopia , I just wanted to do something else . &quot;
preparation is all : RO@@ BE@@ L Ki@@ ros Hab@@ te is ready for the big race .
quickly the first nick@@ names made the round .
some media referred to him as the &quot; ro@@ bel of the whale . &quot;
&quot; in accordance with a &quot; &quot; prosperity &quot; &quot; the English tab@@ loid &quot; &quot; The Sun &quot; &quot; was funny with &quot; &quot; D@@ ad B@@ od &quot; &quot; about him . &quot;
&quot; his time , he first hit the 100 @-@ meter @-@ fre@@ estyle with a minute and almost five seconds , played no part . &quot;
compar@@ isons with &quot; Eric the E@@ el &quot; have also been drawn .
&quot; at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney , Eric M@@ ous@@ s@@ ban@@ i took care of media attention . &quot;
&quot; unforgettable was the appearance of the s@@ wimm@@ ers from Equ@@ at@@ orial Guinea , when he had to compete over 100 metres of free @-@ style in a subur@@ b . &quot;
f@@ ren@@ e@@ tically M@@ ous@@ se@@ ban@@ i was fired at that time .
the then 22 @-@ year @-@ old learned to swim 8 months before the Olympic and had never completed such a long distance before the competition .

&quot; according to the police , 67 @-@ year @-@ old Ger@@ ets@@ rie@@ der@@ in had left their business on Monday at 5.@@ 30 p.m. and forgot to close a window on the ground floor . &quot;

Tru@@ mp is not so close to the im@@ pending election defeat
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp talks about a campaign in Florida .
&quot; should there be nothing with the election to the US President , Donald Tru@@ mp has an alternative video . &quot;
he then asc@@ ends to the holiday .
&quot; if Donald Tru@@ mp loses the US presidential elections in November , it wouldn &apos;t matter : &quot; ultimately it will either fold , or I have a very , very beautiful , long vacation , &quot; said the Republi@@ can candidate in a telephone interview with the US TV station CN@@ BC . &quot;
&quot; if it is not enough for him at the end for reasons of political correctness , this is al@@ right , said Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; he called US President Barack Obama and the Democrats of the Democrats , H@@ illary Clinton , as founder of the terrorist Islamic State ( IS ) . &quot;
&quot; within his party , more and more resistance was formed . &quot;
post asc@@ ends into trading with electro @-@ transpor@@ ters
an electric deliver@@ er from the Deutsche Post in action .
the interest of other companies in the vehicle is obviously great .
the post plans to sell their electric vehicle Stre@@ et@@ Sco@@ oter as well .
the Group plans to start trading with the transpor@@ ter shortly .
the post wants to offer its electric vehicles on the free car market from the coming year .
&quot; we want to enter the sale to third parties , &quot; said a post @-@ spokes@@ man on Friday . &quot;
&quot; for months , the company has been testing whether they will sell their self @-@ developed street sco@@ ot@@ ers , with which letters and pack@@ ets will be delivered , also to other establishments . &quot;
&quot; post @-@ CEO Jürgen Ger@@ he had said that there is always questioning , for example by craftsmen . &quot;
&quot; following information from the news magazine &quot; Der Spiegel , &quot; the Bon@@ ner Group plans to enter the mass production of vehicles shortly . &quot;
&quot; the company plans to build up to 10,000 cars a year and a layer in its post @-@ factory manufacturing facility . &quot;
&quot; Ger@@ des announced that the Group wanted to significantly increase its fleet of electric cars and , in the long run , make a complete change@@ over to the environmentally friendly vehicles . &quot;
&quot; we will make a very , very robust move towards 2020 , &quot; he said at the end of July . &quot;
I can imagine that we will change the entire fleet .
the sco@@ oter has been active on Germany &apos;s roads since 2014 .
GF@@ RP guidance begins after dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures
the Gf@@ K consumer research company exchanges his boss Matthias Hart@@ mann .
the tail@@ pieces came suddenly - but not quite surprising .
&quot; the difficult situation of the market research firm Gf@@ K for@@ esh@@ ad@@ owed that the chair of Chairman of the Board of Management , Matthias Hart@@ mann , will be even more uns@@ af@@ e , the longer the successes promised by him . &quot;
turbul@@ ence at the head of Nuremberg &apos;s market research firm Gf@@ K : after once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing business figures and the res@@ ignation of the company management stands the world &apos;s number five in front of a personnel new beginning .
GF@@ RP CEO wants to leave the company at the end of the year .
&quot; the Chairman of the Gf@@ K Supervisory Board , Ar@@ no Mahl@@ ert , has already been dischar@@ ged from the Supervisory Board with effect from September 12 . &quot;
&quot; the management in the Management Board already took over the previous board member Gerhard Haus@@ bu@@ inger as of September 1 , and shared the company . &quot;
&quot; he will officially assume the function of a &quot; &quot; CEO &quot; &quot; until a successor has been found for Hart@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; as a reason for the withdrawal , the company called &quot; differing views &quot; on long @-@ term business policy orientation . &quot;
a company spokes@@ man did not want to mention the details on Friday .
&quot; who will be leading the market research company in the future , is still unclear at this time . &quot;
&quot; in An@@ le@@ ger@@ circles it was called Friday , with the shareholders , the disappointment about the continued success of the restructuring measures introduced several years ago has been great . &quot;
Mr Hart@@ mann has been at the Gf@@ K @-@ summit since 2011 .
&quot; the fruits of restructuring , however , have not yet to be seen after 5 years , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; given the last bad Gf@@ K business figures , each shareholder will eventually become un@@ steady at some point . &quot;
&quot; if that would be the case with BMW , this would also make the Qu@@ and@@ ts so &quot; , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; after set@@ backs in the preceding quarters , the company did not stop losing its losses in the second quarter of 2016 . &quot;
&quot; with 36@@ 1.2 million euros , sales were 6.1 percent below the comparable year @-@ earlier quarter . &quot;
&quot; in the first half of the year , sales of € 7@@ 2@@ 1.2 million shr@@ ank by 3.4 percent . &quot;
&quot; in view of its difficult economic situation , earnings in the second quarter benefited particularly from the un@@ seen value of the company . &quot;
&quot; the value depreci@@ ation of EUR 139 million , which was necessary in the Consumer Experience business unit , resulted in a loss of 14@@ 8.2 million euros to the Group . &quot;

&quot; in an accident of a coach with 43 sen@@ iors as passengers , eight people were injured on Thursday in Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ n ( district of Aur@@ ich ) . &quot;
&quot; two of the occup@@ ants suffered severe injuries , the police shared . &quot;
&quot; according to the 66 @-@ year @-@ old driver of the coach of a travel company from Eisen@@ ach , there had to be an opposite vice , which drove partly on the reverse track . &quot;
the bus came to the right of the road and sli@@ d into a dit@@ ch like a spokes@@ woman of the police Aur@@ ich / Witt@@ mund .
&quot; due to the location of the bus the people could not leave the bus autonom@@ ously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
the fire bri@@ g@@ ade liberated the occup@@ ants .
six ambul@@ ances and a emergency ambul@@ ance came to the accident site on the state road 2 .
the un@@ spoiled travelers were brought back from a regular bus to the Kru@@ mm@@ hör@@ ner district of P@@ ew@@ sum .
there they should wait for a replacement bus of the travel company .
the investig@@ ators asked the truck driver and potential witnesses to report to the police .
&quot; from October 1 , 2016 , the fees per cubic metre of waste water will be 3.@@ 44 instead of 2.@@ 10 euros ; for Zul@@ ten@@ berg / Lin@@ den@@ berg / Lop@@ p 3,@@ 36 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 26 Euro ) and for Az@@ endorf 3,@@ 64 Euro ( previously 2.@@ 18 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; at the plant in Az@@ endorf , the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary . &quot;
&quot; after an overnight calculation , the sewage price in Az@@ endorf will then be at 4.@@ 37 euros per cubic meter . &quot;
&quot; as mayor Bernd Stein@@ häuser ( CS@@ U ) reported , the approval of the budget by the Kul@@ mb@@ ach District Office noted that under covers for these wastewater facilities . &quot;
&quot; based on legal principles , the Kas@@ endorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost @-@ effective . &quot;
&quot; as of October 1 , 2016 , citizens as well as industrial and industrial companies from Wel@@ sh , Neu@@ dorf , Re@@ uth , Az@@ endorf , Lop@@ p , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Zul@@ ten@@ berg will have to reach deeper into the pur@@ se . &quot;
the fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent .
&quot; as Chairman of the Board of Management , Herbert Schmidt displayed the committee , a re @-@ calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary . &quot;
&quot; in the period from October 2016 to September 2020 , over@@ - or under@@ cover from the preceding period of calculation may also be equ@@ alized . &quot;
&quot; the grave fee increases were based on the fact that all three wastewater facilities have relatively small facilities with a very low waste water shortage , which is between 6@@ 800 and 1@@ 2000 cubic meters per year . &quot;
&quot; for example , expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis for example . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the sewage treatment in all three plants is slightly declining . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the past period of the cal@@ isation period , all three plants were not least due to their age of refurb@@ ishment and repair expenses in a considerable extent . &quot;
&quot; the plant in Az@@ endorf is almost 30 years old , the plants for Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , Neu@@ dorf and Re@@ uth as well as Zul@@ ten@@ berg , Lin@@ den@@ berg and Lop@@ p almost 20 years . &quot;
Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the sewage plant of Az@@ endorf .
&quot; in the pumping station Wel@@ sh@@ ahl , the nearly 20 years old conveying systems had to be over@@ hau@@ led from the ground and at the pond table Lop@@ p had to be dispos@@ ed of after nearly 20 years of operation , the sewage slu@@ dge dispos@@ es and an additional ventilation facility to be installed in the future . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt : &quot; &quot; these extraordinary expenses came with the continued support and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period . &quot;
&quot; the same applies to electricity costs , which were still clearly below the current level during the previous calculations in 2011 / 2012 . &quot;
&quot; stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants , the expenses for operation and maintenance were full . &quot;
&quot; as a result , Schmidt , the market community of large entertainment costs , has remained spar@@ ed in the wastewater facilities over the past 20 years . &quot;
&quot; the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to be prec@@ arious in the view of stone houses in the long run , especially as one can not extend the supply area of the Fri@@ es@@ enb@@ ach@@ tal se@@ wer@@ age association in order to not extend these facilities because it is concerned with defici@@ ent facilities . &quot;
Bulgaria books for the first time in 8 months of inflation
national statistics show that inflation in Bulgaria was 1 % on a monthly basis in July .
this is the highest value ( since June 2012 ) and the first over zero since October last year when positive 0.2 % were recorded .
the annual average rate of the last 12 months ( August 2015 - July 2016 ) compared to the previous 12 months ( August 2014 - July 2015 ) was measured by the CP@@ I -@@ 0.8 % .
&quot; the consumer price index in July 2016 compared to June 2016 was 10@@ 1.0 % , i.e. the monthly inflation was 1.0 % . &quot;
the inflation rate since the beginning of the year ( July 2016 compared to December 2015 ) was -@@ 0.2 % and the annual inflation in July 2016 compared to July 2015 was -@@ 0.2 % .
&quot; in July 2016 , a price increase in the following groups of consumer goods was observed in comparison with the previous month : food and non @-@ alcoholic drinks ( 1.7 % ) ; Transport ( 1.8 % ) ; leisure and culture ( 6.3 % ) ; various goods and services ( 0.3 % ) . &quot;
&quot; prices fell in clothing and shoes ( 2.2 % ) ; furniture , household appliances and routine maintenance ( 0.5 % ) ; health ( 0.1 % ) . &quot;
&quot; the prices remained as in the pre @-@ month for alcoholic beverages and tobacco ; apartments , water , electricity , gas and other fuels ; communication ; as well as education unchanged . &quot;
Snap@@ chat &quot; Ani@@ me &quot; effect as an Asian car@@ ic@@ ature critic@@ ises
&quot; Snap@@ chat states that this filter is anim@@ e @-@ inspired , but some observers say it is in@@ sensitive to races . &quot;
&quot; with its Filter@@ tool , Snap@@ chat enables around 150 million daily users to change reality and play with identi@@ ties in such a way that borders the absur@@ dity . &quot;
&quot; you can turn into a p@@ ine@@ apple , a dog or a figure out of a Roy Licht@@ enstein painting . &quot;
&quot; the filters are non @-@ blo@@ ated , stand@@ alone rotating tools that generate more than 30 million vi@@ cious sel@@ fies per day . &quot;
all mis@@ carri@@ ages arrive at the public .
&quot; snap@@ chat filters have critics in the past , in which they were accused that the app would promote black@@ face conveying or white skin as a beauty ideal . &quot;
&quot; when this week gave some users a filter that gave them sli@@ t eyes , false teeth and dark che@@ eks , some critics called a rac@@ ist car@@ ic@@ ature from Asi@@ ans - &quot; yellow face . &quot; &quot;
they asked themselves if these repeated controversy were pointing to a bigger problem that the company has diversity .
&quot; news and ou@@ trage were widespread on Wednesday , with reports from The Ver@@ ge and Mot@@ her@@ board , a day after Snap@@ chat reported that it would have disabled the feature . &quot;
the company offered an ap@@ ology : the filter was thought to be an homage to anim@@ e characters and not as car@@ ic@@ ature of Asi@@ ans .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders , who experienced racism , reminded the filter of hur@@ t@@ ful c@@ lich@@ és . &quot;
others rejected the anim@@ e comparison .
&quot; in an email , Grace Spar@@ ap@@ ani , a Korean @-@ American art student whose twe@@ et was widespread over the photos , wrote that the filter was &quot; hur@@ t@@ ful and jel@@ ly said unpleasant . &quot; &quot;
she added that &quot; it was difficult to argue with the comparison of a very contradictory Asian car@@ ic@@ ature and the filter effects .
&quot; it shows that the filter is not yel@@ low@@ ish , but that the yellow face was pulled into the degra@@ ding extreme . &quot;
snapshot is not the only company that crosses this cultural Stol@@ per@@ ate .
&quot; American culture seems to be involved in an endless diversity of diversity and integration , from conference rooms to Hollywood and the devices that we all hold in hand . &quot;
&quot; and Snap@@ ch@@ ats large audience of young people - who are more di@@ vers@@ ari@@ ously in terms of race di@@ vers@@ er than their older opponents - could rather assume , sensi@@ bility to expect . &quot;
&quot; when one of Snap@@ ch@@ ats Fil@@ ters creates an image that is insul@@ ting for a user , &quot; it is much more difficult that such items remain un@@ noticed than it was before , &quot; said the 25 @-@ year @-@ old K@@ atie Z@@ hu in an interview on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Z@@ hu , who works as a product manager and engineer for medium , decided to delete her Snap@@ chat account , asked others to do the same . &quot;
&quot; in an essay for medium and in a phone interview , she said that they believe that race @-@ based controversi@@ es reflect a lack of diversity in the settings practices at Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu critici@@ zed the largely white , only male leadership and ended her essay with a h@@ ash@@ tag : # Del@@ et@@ e@@ Snap@@ chat . &quot;
&quot; either they have no diverse representation of people with other skin colors in their workforce , so they can make such decisions , &quot; &quot; said the Chinese @-@ American Z@@ hu , &quot; &quot; or they have people with other skin colors that work there , but not in positions where they feel safe or comfortable to say about it . &quot;
&quot; others share their opinion , a complaint that largely ignored Snap@@ chat . &quot;
the company does not publish numbers on the diversity of its workforce and points to its status as a private enterprise .
&quot; on Thursday , it rejected Snap@@ chat to discuss the cultural background of its employees , but according to a spokes@@ man , the company recently recru@@ ited a personnel officer focusing on sub@@ represented population groups and on internal integration efforts . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ hu , on their part , said they closed their Snap@@ chat account and added , &quot; I wonder if they need more users like us to say that it is not O.@@ K. &quot;
&quot; military leadership distorted IS@@ IS intelligence information , establishes Committee of Congress &quot;
&quot; military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so @-@ called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria , when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground to report a report on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; preliminary Report , created by a Task Force of Republi@@ can members of the Ar@@ med Forces of Ar@@ med Forces , Intelligence Committ@@ ees and the Ar@@ ms Control Committee , reports of great dis@@ satisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superi@@ ors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; the Central Command , shortly Cen@@ com , is the military headquarters in T@@ amp@@ a , Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia . &quot;
&quot; intelligence services rendered by high @-@ level Cent@@ com Com@@ man@@ ders typically drew a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site , and were consistently positive as analysis of other intelligence services , &quot; a newspaper article quoted the report . &quot;
&quot; what happened at Cent@@ com is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders , &quot; &quot; said Ken Cal@@ vert , Republi@@ can member of the House of Represent@@ atives . &quot;
the manag@@ erial errors in the Cent@@ com go up to the top of the organization .
the ten @-@ page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces .
&quot; although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change reports , it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their superi@@ ors , an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State , also known as IS@@ IS or IS@@ IL . &quot;
&quot; during the first half of 2015 , many Central Command press releases , statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than the facts &quot; stated the report . &quot;
&quot; for example , Cent@@ Com has publicly known that a military re@@ conquest of Mos@@ sul@@ s could already begin in April or May 2015 . &quot;
&quot; Mos@@ ul , the second largest city in Iraq , remains under the control of the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; after months of investigation , so much is clear . &quot; said Mike Pom@@ pe@@ o , Republi@@ can Con@@ gres@@ sman from K@@ ans@@ as , in a statement . &quot;
&quot; from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015 , the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of IS@@ IS in Iraq . &quot;
the Repub@@ lic@@ ans called the Task Force in life after being played that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State .
&quot; the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights , while the investigation will continue . &quot;
&quot; in addition , further investigations of the Cent@@ com reports are underway through the Chief In@@ spec@@ tor of the Department of Defense . &quot;
democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coinci@@ ded with some of the conclusions of the Republi@@ can Task Force .
&quot; in 2014 and 2015 , Cent@@ Com created an over@@ ly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments for IS@@ IL and Iraqi security services , &quot; &quot; announced the high @-@ ranking dem@@ ok@@ rat in the committee , member of the House of Represent@@ atives Adam B. Schiff , in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; this process , as Mr. Schiff , &quot; delayed the publication of intelligence reports , &quot; Dam@@ aged morality under analysts and &quot; gave too little room for diver@@ ging opinions . &quot;
but Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of intervention of the White House at Cent@@ Com analysts regarding a &quot; definite political opinion . &quot;
the preliminary results of the conference were published on Tuesday by The Daily Be@@ ast .
&quot; last August , the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspec@@ tor , who were admitted to Cent@@ Com analy@@ st complaints . &quot;
&quot; C@@ m@@ dr@@ . Patrick Ev@@ ans , a spokes@@ man of the Pentagon , announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress , while the investigation of the general inspec@@ tor was still underway . &quot;
&quot; but he also admitted that &quot; experts sometimes have quite diver@@ ging opinions on interpretation of complex data , and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence . &quot;
the investigations have re@@ perc@@ ussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria ( an asser@@ tion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense ) .
&quot; however , last year &apos;s accus@@ ations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command to evaluate military operations in Iraq , Afghanistan , Libya and other crisis regions . &quot;
&quot; the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the inter@@ dependence of more than ten years ago when a Cent@@ com analy@@ st , Greg@@ ory Hoo@@ ker , wrote a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush fores@@ aw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003 . &quot;
Mr. Hoo@@ ker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State .
&quot; last year , the team led by Mr. Hoo@@ ker after stating that government agencies had no significant impact on the terrorist group &apos;s financial situation , since these temporary refin@@ eries would have put up oil on the black market . &quot;
&quot; this recognition , however , was not published , the Times reported in September . &quot;
&quot; Cent@@ com@@ s dam@@ n commander , Gen@@ . Lloyd J. Austin III , was critic@@ ised by members of the Legisl@@ ative for his excessive positive app@@ rais@@ al of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate . &quot;
general Austin retired in April and was replaced by Gen@@ . Joseph L. V@@ otel at the Central Command .
&quot; the US wins fourth match in the field hockey of women , a show@@ down with Great Britain stands before &quot;
&quot; one day after she had shot three goals during a 6 @-@ 1 victory over Japan , K@@ atie B@@ am also made the first two gates for the American campaign hockey team in a match on Thursday against India that the Americans won with 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; five gates in two games should actually represent a memorable performance , but B@@ am ( 27 ) said she could not remember that ever done . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; I have no idea . &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind .
&quot; however , she knows that the Americans are at 4 @-@ 0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Brit@@ ons in the first place , who remain unbe@@ aten after their 2 @-@ 0 victory against Japan . &quot;
Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round .
&quot; both teams have already qualified for the quarter @-@ fin@@ als , the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams . &quot;
the first placed will take a bit longer for the strong Dutch to lead the other group .
&quot; as always the game may go out on Saturday , the Americans have triggered a surprising whi@@ rl@@ wind through their success story , four years after they landed on the last of 12 seats at the last London Games . &quot;
BA@@ M was part of this team .
&quot; she grew up in Blue Bell , Pennsylvania , and had the first time with three years a hockey rider in hands ( her two older sisters played the sport at the Dre@@ xel University ) , with 16 years she became national player of the USA , the youngest in the history of the team . &quot;
&quot; she missed the Olympics in 2008 , because she could not qualify for the cad@@ re . &quot;
then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team .
&quot; in the following year Cra@@ ig Par@@ n@@ ham , an Engl@@ ish@@ man , trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things better . &quot;
&quot; a change of culture , a mental change and a physical change , &quot; B@@ am said . &quot;
we did not have the work@@ load in London that we now have .
we have been able to ro@@ p the ru@@ dder completely .
on Thursday evening B@@ am opened the Tor@@ rei@@ gen in the first half of the game with a back@@ stop from the close @-@ up area .
&quot; India had gone to the game without winning the tournament , but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1 @-@ 0 to the third quarter until B@@ am took the game into their hands . &quot;
&quot; she performed a spr@@ int with the flat ball over the left flan@@ k , then moved to the center and kno@@ cked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2 @-@ 0 guide . &quot;
Mel@@ issa Gon@@ z@@ al@@ ez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter .
&quot; the Sh@@ ut@@ out was the first of all the tournament for the keeper of the USA , Jack@@ ie Brig@@ gs , who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games . &quot;
she has a run .
just like B@@ am .
&quot; we are in a good position &quot; said Par@@ n@@ ham , but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the age of the Olympic Games , the Zen of the trampoline &quot;
&quot; wherever you are , how late it is , it is the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling steady and unavoid@@ able , a fur@@ ious relay race between competition and aspir@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff , which is handed down from the w@@ rist@@ watch to the s@@ wimm@@ ers to the tri@@ athletes . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t turn on the TV , read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour in the coffee shop without hearing Simone Bil@@ es , K@@ atie Le@@ deck@@ y or the dispute between Michael P@@ helps and C@@ had le C@@ los . &quot;
and then there is Lo@@ gan Do@@ ol@@ ey .
&quot; Do@@ ol@@ ey , who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women &apos;s black with dimples , could have been among those familiar names sent to Prime Time , built by sponsors and feel @-@ TV advertising when he was a s@@ wimm@@ ers , gymn@@ ast or even f@@ isher . &quot;
&quot; but Do@@ ol@@ ey , 28 , from Lake Forest , California , fights for gold in the Olympic tramp@@ ol@@ ines . &quot;
the Olympic flame does not illumin@@ ate every event .
&quot; further from the centre , partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognised : air pist@@ ol shooting , arch@@ ery , bad@@ min@@ ton , Ta@@ ek@@ won@@ do . &quot;
we will always have the breast@@ stroke and may it rule for a long time .
&quot; but if I should make a modest argument for my particular favourite , then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline . &quot;
&quot; although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000 , when it had its debut in Sydney , it became so spar@@ sely perceived for the last 16 years that many people I asked , did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport . &quot;
this could also be regional ignorance .
&quot; although the USA sent athletes to competition , there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had until 2012 had an ath@@ lete who made it to the final round . &quot;
the Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadi@@ ans for the women .
D@@ ong D@@ ong from China and Ro@@ sie Mac@@ L@@ enn@@ an from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year .
&quot; jumping on the trampoline has some outside char@@ me , partly because it is suitable for the uns@@ ec@@ ured ear for a c@@ low@@ n@@ s@@ school that sounds for the Olympics . &quot;
&quot; at this point , I should admit that I am not an expert , but only an earth@@ bound enthusi@@ ast . &quot;
&quot; it has humor@@ istic potential - the carto@@ on@@ ous trem@@ bling of his never @-@ ending boun@@ cing - but also the gra@@ zie of gymn@@ as@@ tics and diving , which combines two types of sports that it combines essentially . &quot;
&quot; the word &quot; &quot; trampoline &quot; &quot; comes from the Spanish El Tramp@@ oline , which means as much as &quot; spring@@ board . &quot; &quot;
&quot; asp@@ iring vic@@ tors jump on a gigantic trampoline , shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements ( turning , pi@@ ke and sal@@ tos ) before they land at their feet . &quot;
&quot; according to the official Olympi@@ ad programme , they are rated according to design , difficulty level and &quot; flight time . &quot; &quot;
&quot; athletes from 17 countries , 16 men and 16 women compete against each other in Rio . &quot;
the common Olympic v@@ ector is straight ahead .
&quot; med@@ alli@@ ons must move on to gold in their quest for gold , faster , up and down , sometimes to the finish , sometimes back and forth , upwards and down@@ wards at the playground . &quot;
&quot; they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall , but also another height objective in television transmission : the world or the Olympi@@ ar@@ ec@@ ord . &quot;
&quot; the goal oriented aspir@@ ation is no@@ bel , ad@@ mira@@ ble , even fan@@ atic - and it is enough to even stir up a spect@@ ator to tears . &quot;
but it is also what I perceive myself when looking at these games as something ti@@ res@@ ome .
the trampoline offers a resp@@ ite .
the v@@ ector of the trampoline is above .
a forward movement is not the goal .
&quot; he or she boun@@ ces off , seemingly wei@@ ght@@ less like an a@@ stron@@ aut , goes up , then downward , then effort@@ lessly back up . &quot;
&quot; there is also a competition , of course not without difficulty , but during exercise there is no hec@@ tic attack on the goal , no wol@@ ves into the distance , only the dre@@ amy , elegant lifting of time and gravity . &quot;
it is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics .
&quot; the women &apos;s qualification and en@@ cores will take place on Friday afternoon , in streaming at 13@@ .00 Eastern Time ; the men on Saturday , also at 13@@ .00 . &quot;
N@@ BC will radi@@ ate the en@@ cores as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14@@ .00 .
&quot; in the midst of the Olympia man@@ ia they promise a quiet , nice moment , one that is likely to be overlooked in the general tur@@ mo@@ il . &quot;
&quot; if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the an@@ gling and the objectiv@@ eness of male athletes - as the male US gymn@@ asts proposed recently - according to the Wall Street Journal , Mr. Do@@ ol@@ ey anticip@@ ates his new fan base . &quot;
&quot; one generation prot@@ ested &quot; in Ethiopia , Long A ally of the USA &quot;
violent protests in Ethiopia
demonstr@@ ators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met violent opposition from the government .
witnesses say dozens of prot@@ esters were killed during clas@@ hes with police at gun@@ shot .
is Ethiopia just to collapse ?
&quot; in the last ten years , it was one of the most stable countries in Africa , a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy . &quot;
&quot; but in recent months protests against the government sh@@ ook the country , and expanded into more and more areas . &quot;
last week thousands of people stor@@ med the streets and demanded fundamental political changes .
&quot; according to human rights organisations , the government &apos;s response was rel@@ ent@@ less . &quot;
witnesses stated that polic@@ emen fired and killed dozens of un@@ armed protest@@ ors .
&quot; circul@@ ating videos on the protests , which are probably from the last or early of this year , show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall . &quot;
the chief of the UN Human Rights Committee now demands a thorough investigation .
&quot; it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult , &quot; said Ras@@ hid Ab@@ di , the project leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group , a research group . &quot;
&quot; after Nigeria , Ethiopia is the most popul@@ ous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West . &quot;
&quot; American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiop@@ ians to fight terrorism over the region , especially in Somalia . only a few countries in Africa , if at all , get so much Western help . &quot;
Ethiopia &apos;s economy expanded at a resp@@ ectable pace .
its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commu@@ ter train in the capital of Ad@@ dis Ab@@ aba .
&quot; the streets are generally quiet , safe and clean . &quot;
&quot; although Ethiopia is anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted , whereby dissi@@ dents were effectively sil@@ enced . &quot;
&quot; many were sent to exile or prison , killed or driven into the expan@@ se of the desert . &quot;
but that could change .
&quot; if you supp@@ ress people and they don &apos;t have any other options except prot@@ esting , it breaks out , &quot; said Se@@ at m Tes@@ mobil , a lecturer in central e@@ thiop@@ ia . &quot;
all the youth are prot@@ esting .
a generation protests .
there are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stran@@ gle@@ hold regarding the power of the governing coalition .
&quot; after a widely critici@@ zed election last year , the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament . &quot;
&quot; at the same time tensions are rising along the border to Er@@ it@@ rea ; a fight for this sha@@ ky , controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June . &quot;
&quot; analysts fear that separ@@ ati@@ sts like the O@@ rom@@ o Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of O@@ ga@@ den , who in recent years have been more or less forced to exploit the turbul@@ ence and re @-@ arm themselves . &quot;
several factors explain why feelings of bit@@ tern@@ ess after years of hiding behind the surface are now explo@@ ding .
the first appears harmless : smartphones .
&quot; only in recent years , many Ethiop@@ ians have been able to communicate with the social media , since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved . &quot;
&quot; even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter , what it does at regular intervals , especially among the protests , many people can still communicate via Internet pro@@ x@@ ies that hide where they reside . &quot;
several young Ethiop@@ ians claimed that they were gathered to protest in such a way .
&quot; the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as , the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia . &quot;
the O@@ ro@@ mos and Am@@ har@@ as are not natural enemies .
&quot; for e@@ ons , the Am@@ har@@ as , who come from Ethiopia &apos;s predominantly Christian high@@ lands , prosp@@ ered in politics and economy , while they exploited the O@@ ro@@ mos , of which many Muslims are and live in low@@ land areas . &quot;
but this is changing just as well .
&quot; we are here to coordinate under a umbrella , &quot; said Mul@@ atu Gem@@ ech@@ u , a leader of O@@ ro@@ mos . &quot;
the greatest protests took place in the areas of Am@@ har@@ a and O@@ ro@@ mos .
&quot; many Am@@ har@@ as and O@@ ro@@ mos have the feeling that Ethiopia is being dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tig@@ ray , which account for about 6 per cent of the population , dominant in the military , intelligence services , trade and politics . &quot;
the third reason for un@@ rest is the death of Mel@@ es Zen@@ awi .
&quot; until his death in 2012 , Mr. Mel@@ es , a former rebel leader , was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death . &quot;
&quot; he was regarded as a tac@@ tical genius , a man who could think about corners . &quot;
analysts say that he was especially vers@@ ed in perc@@ ei@@ ving early signs of dis@@ satisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless .
&quot; the current regime lacks this basic skill , &quot; &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , a conflict analy@@ st . &quot;
&quot; Ethiopia &apos;s new prime minister , H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am Des@@ al@@ eg@@ n , was chosen for relatively op@@ aque reasons to take Mr. Mel@@ es &apos;s position . &quot;
&quot; unlike Mr. Mel@@ es , who came from the Tig@@ ray region of northern Ethiopia , Mr. H@@ ail@@ em@@ ari@@ am comes from the south . &quot;
analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tig@@ ray .
many fear that the result will be more blood@@ shed .
&quot; the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a tur@@ mo@@ il in 2005 , after thousands were prot@@ esting against elections , which according to analysts apparently ple@@ aded by the government and were subsequently stolen . &quot;
&quot; during the subsequent ra@@ ids many prot@@ esters were killed , even though they were less than in the last months and that time of un@@ rest went relatively quickly . &quot;
&quot; experts praised Ethiopia &apos;s leaders for their vision@@ ary infrastructure planning , such as the new commu@@ ter train , as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction . &quot;
but obviously this did not prevent the intensi@@ fication of the internal gri@@ ev@@ ances of the Ethiop@@ ian government .
and it takes a dangerous eth@@ ni@@ cal form .
&quot; last month , prot@@ esters in Gon@@ dar , an am@@ har@@ an city , attacked by Tig@@ ray and hatred towards the Tig@@ ray is becoming more and more common in social media . &quot;
analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position .
&quot; the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for D@@ ron@@ en@@ flüge over the neighbouring Somalia , even though it recently announced that it has closed this base . &quot;
&quot; while the West clearly wants to support democracy , it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volati@@ le region . &quot;
&quot; this , &quot; said Mr. Ab@@ di , &quot; is a very thin balancing act . &quot;
Donald Tru@@ mp explains his asser@@ tion Obama has founded IS@@ IS was &quot; sar@@ cas@@ m &quot;
&quot; Donald J. Tru@@ mp attempted to disp@@ el the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday , attacking his multi @-@ repeated claim , President Obama and H@@ illary Clinton would be the &quot; founder &quot; of the terrorist group Islamic State , not serious . &quot;
this clari@@ fication raised new questions on the communications capabilities of the Republi@@ can presidential candidate whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public .
&quot; it also brings his comrades who are trying to take care of him during an event@@ ful phase , into the peculiar position to explain statements he could not have meant at all . &quot;
&quot; having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening , Mr. Tru@@ mp reli@@ ed on the claim on Thursday and insi@@ sted in interviews that he really did not intend to point out , the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created IS@@ IS . &quot;
&quot; but in an early morning T@@ we@@ et on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp said he was just sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ we@@ et was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Tru@@ mp said in a series of interviews , he said the accus@@ ation was completely serious . &quot;
&quot; the conservative Radi@@ om@@ or@@ ator Hu@@ gh He@@ wit@@ t Mr. Tru@@ mp wanted to help weak@@ en the statement by remin@@ ding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy IS@@ IS , the Republi@@ can presidential candidate has not wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the last storm of criticism imp@@ ashes Mr. Tru@@ mp , while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling demand . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches to the economic situation in Mich@@ igan this week .
on Friday Mr. Tru@@ mp attempted to return to this subject again .
&quot; using Twitter , he warned that Mrs. Clinton &apos;s suggestion would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring . &quot;
Mr. Tru@@ mp has already brought sar@@ cas@@ m to his defense .
&quot; at the end of July he critic@@ ised himself when he said that the Russians should chop Mrs Clinton &apos;s emails , but later he explained &quot; &quot; Of course I said the sar@@ c@@ astic . &quot;
this method allows Mr. Tru@@ mp to post@@ p@@ one the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to rowing back to demand .
&quot; I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans , how they arrive , and then &quot; clarify &quot; depending on how the reaction fails . &quot; said Ruth Sher@@ man , a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates . &quot;
&quot; but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vag@@ ue enough , so that they can be interpreted in different ways . &quot;
&quot; instead of def@@ using the tone for the presidential elections , Mr. Tru@@ mp accepted an even more estimated sound , as his survey values went further . &quot;
&quot; a new survey by N@@ BC / Wall Street Journal / Mar@@ is , which was published on Friday , showed a lead in the states North Carolina , Virginia , Colorado and a head @-@ to @-@ head race in Florida . &quot;
&quot; while Mr. Tru@@ mp is generally trying to not ap@@ ologi@@ ze for his pro@@ voc@@ ative statements , he often bl@@ ames his critics to dist@@ ort his statements or mis@@ understand his humor . &quot;
&quot; but while he focuses the attention of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign , Mr. Tru@@ mp Scher@@ ze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation , regardless of how pro@@ voc@@ ative his statements may be . &quot;
&quot; Rudol@@ ph W. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , former mayor of New York and one of Tru@@ mp &apos;s most prominent speakers , tried to defend the candidate today in a CN@@ N interview from Thursday . &quot;
&quot; I believe what he says are legitimate , political comments , &quot; Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani , therefore , asked Mr. Gi@@ uli@@ ani about the correctness of Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State . &quot;
&quot; it is true in this sense that before Obama IS@@ IS was an almost unknown , small organization , he called it back@@ ben@@ chers , completely wrong and therefore it happened because he with@@ drew the troops from Iraq . &quot;
&quot; most mainstream re@@ public@@ ans try to argue that the government under Obama , in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister , allowed IS@@ IS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggres@@ sively under control . &quot;
&quot; before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday , Mr. Tru@@ mp continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words and being pre@@ occupied against him . &quot;
&quot; he ridi@@ cul@@ ed the &quot; poor , pa@@ thetic &quot; television experts who try to understand and said , &quot; You can &apos;t ! . &quot; &quot;
some of the Democrats ridi@@ cul@@ ed Mr. Tru@@ mp &apos;s ap@@ ology as just another proof that he was un@@ suitable for the presi@@ dency .
&quot; once lifted over the price of the market , Café de Green@@ point returns &quot;
&quot; Ver@@ b Cafe was a cre@@ denti@@ al café in Willi@@ am@@ sburg , where you could pay only cash , which was not Wi @-@ Fi , but served for 15 years of good coffee . &quot;
&quot; of course , the prices of his Bed@@ ford Avenue Lad@@ en@@ front were displaced . &quot;
&quot; soap Cher@@ ie shop , replacing Ver@@ b in summer 2014 , sells soap in the form of cup@@ cakes . &quot;
local residents smoked it as the last loss in a gent@@ ri@@ fied city .
&quot; the artist Mol@@ ly Cra@@ b@@ apple wrote on Twitter , &quot; I know New York is change , but I still can &apos;t believe that CB@@ GB is dead , the Chelsea Hotel except and Ver@@ b is now a soap business . &quot;
&quot; but when New York is changing , it is also new finding . &quot;
&quot; a re@@ animated Ver@@ b Cafe opened last November in Green@@ point , less than a mile north of its original location . &quot;
&quot; the new verb has Wi @-@ Fi and accepts credit cards , but still has some of the same staff and a similarly simple atmosphere . &quot;
the coffee is still good .
&quot; the new owner of the club is Cisco Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , a long @-@ standing employee of the old café , the owner and managing director of the new cafe . &quot;
he began to work in Ver@@ b in 2001 and remained there until the end .
&quot; when a customer offered him to provide money for a new external source , he was excited to do it , he said . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , 36 , maintained a lot . &quot;
Ver@@ b uses the same distributor for bag@@ els purchased the same es@@ presso machine model .
it even uses the same lamps from the old verb .
but Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment .
he introduced new ingredients .
&quot; on the menu there are sand@@ wiches with bac@@ on and cheese , and there are gar@@ n@@ ings like cap@@ ers and sau@@ cep@@ ted onions . &quot;
there are natural itiner@@ aries .
&quot; the café doesn &apos;t serve beer any more , but there are fresh juices . &quot;
&quot; after nine months , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he had noticed a steady stream of old regular customers . &quot;
&quot; many old customers were also displaced by Willi@@ am@@ sburg &apos;s prices , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; recently , on a Sunday , Rebecca Oli@@ v@@ eira was such a customer . &quot;
&quot; Oli@@ v@@ eira , 34 , lived in Willi@@ am@@ sburg in former times and regularly visited the club . &quot;
&quot; even after she had moved to Green@@ point , she would take the road . &quot;
&quot; after the verb was closed , she stopped drinking coffee for a while , she said . &quot;
&quot; it became clear to me that there was coffee and culture in the verb that liked me , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; now she drinks coffee again , even though she ordered a bl@@ ended Cha@@ i Tea on that day instead of their usual iced coffee , which is another new addition . &quot;
Tom Ros@@ enthal has been a long and faithful customer since the beginning of the Ver@@ b in 2003 .
he went there before the work and inevitably ordered the same .
&quot; I came to seven , every day , like a Swiss pocket watch and they prepare my Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with butter , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
photo Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said he wanted to experiment and add new ingredients to the menu .
&quot; today Ros@@ enthal still receives his usual order , but sometimes he changes his Every@@ thing @-@ Ba@@ gel with bac@@ on , egg and cheese . &quot;
&quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez said , that he won &apos;t take a gru@@ dge over the fact that the soap business has taken the old business space . &quot;
&quot; indeed , the owners of So@@ ap Cher@@ ie offered to make a special soap for ver@@ b with the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee of the cafe as an ingredient . &quot;
&quot; I think we will go into their offer , &quot; &quot; said Rodri@@ gu@@ ez . &quot;
&quot; and the traditional Polish residents , Green@@ points , have also accepted the café . &quot;
&quot; a new customer translated the menu into Polish and Rodri@@ gu@@ ez told him that he preferred to exhibit her soon , so that his new neighbours will feel welcome . &quot;
the location also has other advantages .
a local juice producer wants to fill and sell the cold @-@ bre@@ wed coffee .
there is a chance that the café expands to a neighboring building .
a new verb is enough for many customers to get their old favor@@ ites .
Joseph W@@ itt was a regular customer and said that he was destroyed by the floor when the café closed .
&quot; when the new café opened , Wh@@ itt said that entering the restaurant and ordering a new coffee was felt like a hom@@ ec@@ oming . &quot;
&quot; I had to smell it , &quot; he said . &quot;
the de@@ pressing food of the economic crisis in &quot; a rich meal &quot;
&quot; in March 1933 , shortly after his rise to the president , Fran@@ klin Del@@ ano Roosev@@ elt took his lunch in the O@@ val Office . &quot;
&quot; as a delic@@ acy , President Roosev@@ elt had a passion for refined delicacies of Fi@@ fth Avenue such as P@@ â@@ te de fo@@ ie gr@@ as and Mary@@ land water tur@@ tle soup . &quot;
&quot; his menu on that day was a bit more modest : stu@@ ffed eggs in tomato sauce , m@@ ashed potatoes and dessert a pl@@ um pu@@ dding . &quot;
&quot; it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people , &quot; &quot; said Jane Bur@@ man . &quot;
&quot; her husband Andrew Co@@ e added , &quot; It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat . &quot;
the couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians .
&quot; CO@@ E last book &quot; &quot; C@@ hop Su@@ ey &quot; &quot; acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while Bri@@ ck@@ man told in her book &quot; 97 Orch@@ ard &quot; about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective . &quot;
&quot; her latest collaboration , &quot; A decent meal , &quot; which will appear on Tuesday at Har@@ per Verlag , illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a re@@ porter in the Eis@@ enberg &apos;s Sand@@ wich Shop for dinner , a small , straightforward snack at the Fl@@ ati@@ ron District , which has been in business since the crash of 1929 . &quot;
&quot; brick , 54 , ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces , while Co@@ e , 57 , tur@@ key ate with m@@ ashed potatoes and vegetable mixture . &quot;
&quot; when the re@@ porter ordered chi@@ ppers , this found the couple fit for a discussion of the food in the era of the Great Depression . &quot;
&quot; rich foods were very popular , &quot; &quot; said Bri@@ ck@@ man . &quot;
&quot; there was pe@@ an@@ ut bread , cheese and bean bread . &quot;
they were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient .
imagine eating as many pe@@ an@@ uts that they serve them as dinner .
Co@@ E gr@@ ins .
&quot; it must have appe@@ aled to the stomach like lead , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget , especially in rural areas , an all @-@ You @-@ Can @-@ E@@ at buffet . &quot;
&quot; men of women cooked for male ri@@ ms and it was served freshly baked p@@ ate for breakfast , lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War . &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; marks the roads with which the country was going to be no longer the land of land . &quot;
&quot; it was a time when food for the Americans became a central , ten@@ se subject , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e , why he and his wife wanted to write about it . &quot;
&quot; the new budget was equally ten@@ se : mysterious dishes such as bread and c@@ asser@@ ole were considered to be stap@@ le food , the c@@ asser@@ ol@@ le as a &quot; &quot; wonderful way to re@@ use food lef@@ to@@ vers &quot; , &quot; noted Bri@@ ck@@ man , as chefs were able to hide un@@ appeti@@ zing ingredients from a cre@@ amy sauce . &quot;
fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit .
&quot; meat , which was the focal point of American cuisine for years , became a rarely served luxury . &quot;
&quot; strange mixtures have been tried out , because a cal@@ orie @-@ rich and nutri@@ tious satisfaction has priority over taste or even sound common sense . &quot;
&quot; while resear@@ ching the book , which also includes recipes , Ziegel@@ man prepared a dish of this period , baked onions with pe@@ an@@ ut butter . &quot;
&quot; it was not a popular addition to lunch , &quot; says Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; bri@@ ck@@ mann continues : &quot; &quot; it was sur@@ real . &quot;
pe@@ an@@ ut butter and baked onions don &apos;t fit together .
it was typical for many of the pet recipes .
&quot; as never before or since , household econom@@ ists - including Lou@@ ise Stan@@ ley , head of the Federal Bureau of Home Economics from 1923 to 1943 - contributed to the country &apos;s eating habits . &quot;
&quot; by publishing prescri@@ p@@ tions and articles in newspapers and magazines , they encouraged women to become &quot; house@@ wives &quot; and to meet the challenge of changing P@@ amp@@ e such as cre@@ amy sp@@ agh@@ etti with car@@ rots in delicious meals . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; a Square Me@@ al &quot; &quot; is a festival of historical delicacies . &quot;
&quot; especially tasty are the reports of the government &apos;s response to the hungry citizens , such as President Herbert Hoo@@ ver &apos;s L@@ ass @-@ Me @-@ C@@ ake @-@ food @-@ attitude . &quot;
&quot; while he publicly praised the simple I@@ owa farm cuisine of his kitchen , he spoke as the million@@ th man of the world he has become . &quot;
&quot; he liked continental cuisine like fish with cu@@ cum@@ ber sauce , &quot; Co@@ e said . &quot;
he ate in a nearly gil@@ ded dining room and wore a tu@@ x@@ edo .
he was very realistic .
&quot; President Roosev@@ elt might have made the same mistake , if not his wife Ele@@ an@@ or had asked him to post@@ p@@ one an example with his stomach . &quot;
&quot; as described in the book , the residents of a house@@ keeper with no interest in flavors caused by Ms Roosev@@ elt suggest that the White House produced the most boring food in Washington , but also one of the most comfor@@ ting . &quot;
many of the species from the era of the Great Depression to deal with food was rejected as soon as the country returned to its feet .
&quot; the legacy lies on our continuing focus on calories and food , said bri@@ ck@@ man , as well as on how science was applied to foods . &quot;
the couple gave better understanding of the eating habits of Bri@@ ck@@ man &apos;s mother @-@ in @-@ law in writing the book - for example how they could not throw food away .
&quot; she had a real fear of the waste of food , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ e . &quot;
&quot; brick one remembered , &quot; &quot; She really made people sick . &quot;
there was the incident of the wind .
&quot; after the plates were cleared at Eis@@ enberg &apos;s , they and co@@ e drew up a dessert that they had at home : the pl@@ um dessert , the president Roosev@@ elt ate at noon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s called Pr@@ une W@@ hip , &quot; &quot; Bri@@ ck@@ man said , adding that it was a common trick to give modest recipes a chic name . &quot;
&quot; there was no whi@@ pped cream , only pl@@ ums , some flour , sugar , water and cinnamon . &quot;
&quot; everyone di@@ ved something reluct@@ antly into the tough , brown gli@@ b@@ ber . &quot;
amaz@@ ingly it tasted not bad .
Co@@ E picked up three times a night .
&quot; like a Can @-@ Do @-@ Bud@@ get@@ ter he said to his wife , &quot; A few chopped wal@@ nuts would help . &quot;
killed in the attack : he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo
he put his own life on the game to help others : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar .
he was the hero of Ale@@ ppo : Khal@@ ed O@@ mar dedicated his life to the people of Syria .
he ris@@ ked everything to save others life .
now the 30 @-@ year @-@ old himself died in a barrel bomb attack by the Assad regime .
&quot; O@@ mar was a member of the &quot; White Helm@@ ets , &quot; a civil protection group that , according to Bild @-@ Zeitung , saved almost 60,000 people alive . &quot;
29@@ 00 volunteers put their own lives in the game to pull people out of bom@@ bed houses and to provide first aid in the war zone .
they are the heroes of the war in Syria .
O@@ mar was the group &apos;s face : a video of a civilian prot@@ ector that showed him a 11 hour rescue of a baby from the rub@@ ble of a house went around the world in 2014 .
it made the Syrians a shining symbol figure in the horror of war .
&quot; as a hero , he never saw himself , said loud , &quot; &quot; For me , this is the real ji@@ had . &quot;
&quot; when I die to save lives , I think God sees a mart@@ yr in me . &quot;
&quot; shortly before O@@ mar himself fell victim to an attack , he had spoken in a video about the last bombing ra@@ ids in Syria . &quot;
&quot; the helicop@@ ters have dropped four barrel bombs over the Al@@ z@@ adi@@ a district , one was filled with chlorine gas . &quot;
&quot; a woman and two children died , seven people suffer from short@@ ness of breath . &quot;
&quot; we now eliminate the po@@ ison@@ ous rem@@ nants of the bomb , so that children don &apos;t play with it , &quot; the image quotes his final words before he died . &quot;
the deadly bomb of Assad &apos;s regime had to hit terrorists .
Greenland @-@ shar@@ k : the oldest verteb@@ rate is almost 400 years old
rare sight .
Greenland @-@ arks usually come to the surface only in the winter .
this shar@@ k was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship S@@ anna .
he was born in 16@@ 24 and flo@@ ats at about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today .
Greenland will only get offspring with 150 years of age .
&quot; lei@@ surely , the Greenland @-@ shar@@ k swi@@ ms along the northern Atlantic , in an hour , it reaches just 1,@@ 220 metres in an average . &quot;
&quot; only when it matters , the five @-@ metre @-@ long animal acceler@@ ates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed . &quot;
&quot; this lifestyle , characterized by slow@@ ness , seems to be a stap@@ le for a high age . &quot;
&quot; Julius N@@ iel@@ sen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal &quot; Science &quot; in any case from a Greenland @-@ shar@@ k , which could be 3@@ 92 years old . &quot;
&quot; ma@@ dness , &quot; commented Alexander Sch@@ euer@@ lein of the Max @-@ Planck @-@ Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span , which means a world record for verteb@@ rates . &quot;
although the evolutionary bi@@ ologist suspected that Greenland &apos;s hair became st@@ ony .
only lack@@ ed the evidence .
&quot; Greenland arks are hard to observe , after all , they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the spar@@ sely populated coasts of Canada , Greenland , Norway and S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius , they usually appear only in the winter on the surface . &quot;
researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland hairs .
&quot; their slow motion , they measured , when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of S@@ val@@ bard . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the stomach of an animal , researchers found the remains of a seal , another had swal@@ lowed the jaw@@ bone of a young polar bear . &quot;
possibly they hunt down sleeping animals or pat@@ rol at the bottom of the ic@@ ec@@ ore and look for cad@@ aver rising from higher water @-@ layers down tor@@ ches .
Julius N@@ iel@@ sen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland hairs that fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or S@@ val@@ bard as by@@ catch from the depths of the North Atlantic .
&quot; the smallest shar@@ k was just 81 centimet@@ ers long , while the largest 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers measured . &quot;
&quot; to determine the age of the animals , they analysed the lens nucleus of the sh@@ arks with the carbon @-@ 14 method . &quot;
&quot; this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sh@@ arks , the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed later . &quot;
the two smallest sh@@ arks had a noticeable amount of carbon @-@ 14 in the lens nucleus .
&quot; her birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s , when atomic weapons attempts to drag bigger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in the third @-@ smallest animal with 220 centimet@@ ers of length , the l@@ enti@@ l nucleus , on the other hand , contained a small surplus of carbon @-@ 14 from the nuclear weapons , it is expected to celebrate its 50@@ th birthday in 2012 . &quot;
&quot; all major Greenland hairs , on the other hand , had normal carbon @-@ 14 quantities in their lens nucleus , which arises through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere . &quot;
&quot; in fact , the carbon @-@ 14 clock for a 4@@ 93 cen@@ timeter @-@ long Greenland @-@ shar@@ k showed an age of 3@@ 35 years , while the record @-@ shar@@ k is likely to be 3@@ 92 years old with 50@@ 2 centimet@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; that Greenland @-@ shar@@ k females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters , was known . &quot;
&quot; now , the researchers were able to classi@@ fy the length of an age . &quot;
&quot; since one of the animals with 3@@ 92 centimet@@ ers probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years , Greenland arks with the multip@@ lication obviously permit at least one and a half centuries . &quot;
this is also likely to be world record for verteb@@ rates .
the fact that such meth@@ ot@@ ec@@ es live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence .
&quot; the previous record holder , a 2@@ 11 year old Greenland whale , in whose bac@@ on at the neck was a 120 @-@ year @-@ old har@@ po@@ on tip , was caught in front of Alaska . &quot;
&quot; due to the low temperatures , the organism of the animals living there often runs on as@@ par@@ ag@@ us . &quot;
so they mature later - and age slowly .
&quot; in order to keep warm in the cold water , the animals are often very large . &quot;
&quot; because the volume grows much faster than its surface , through which the animal loses heat . &quot;
the heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant .
another advantage : you have fewer enemies .
&quot; a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on as many descendants as possible as possible , &quot; explains the evolutionary bi@@ ologist Sch@@ euer@@ lein . &quot;
&quot; a very large animal , on the other hand , should invest its resources in a long life . &quot;
ground floor in double pack
&quot; in the recent meeting , the municipal council has focuss@@ ed heavily on issues around building . &quot;
&quot; with relief , the board adopted the communication of Mayor Robert P@@ utz that &quot; &quot; finally , the marketing of newly designated residential areas can begin . &quot;
&quot; after the property , plot and closing questions have been clari@@ fied and the applications for sur@@ veying could be made , the sale of land in the residential areas &quot; &quot; Straß@@ l@@ weg &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Schön@@ au @-@ West &quot; &quot; ( area of Bin@@ der@@ straße 1 ) is no longer possible for interested parties . &quot;
the municipal council is convinced that the construction areas in the rural and quiet residential community Schön@@ au address young families and older sen@@ iors equally .
&quot; as it was said , those willing to inform themselves immediately in the town hall , the municipal council is expected to advise the municipal council in its September meeting . &quot;
&quot; in order to also make inquiries regarding the settlement of other industrial companies , connected with the creation of jobs , the municipal council decided to change the newly @-@ prepared land use plan in sub @-@ areas only in the spring of this year . &quot;
&quot; in the area of Unter@@ zeit@@ lar@@ n , the industrial area already proved there is extended by two plots towards the state road 2@@ 112 . &quot;
Frankfurt benefits from the Bre@@ x@@ it
&quot; in the competition with Paris , Dublin and Luxembourg , the city on the Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London . &quot;
&quot; it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Bre@@ x@@ it V@@ ot@@ um , &quot; says Michael Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder , head of the I@@ W &apos;s financial markets and real estate markets . &quot;
&quot; according to the Bre@@ x@@ it referendum , it is uncertain whether money houses continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU . &quot;
&quot; for the so @-@ called EU passport , it is sufficient for them to be admitted in the UK . &quot;
these are just using large US banks .
several banks have already announced to shift jobs .
&quot; the lobby association &quot; &quot; Frankfurt Main Finance &quot; &quot; anticip@@ ates 10,000 new jobs in the Main within five years . &quot;
&quot; for Frankfurt , the I@@ W , the seat of the European Central Bank ( ECB ) is talking about the responsibility for monetary policy and supervision of the largest banks in the euro area , as well as other important authorities , such as the European insurance supervisory authority , E@@ IO@@ PA and the ES@@ R@@ B . &quot;
&quot; in Paris , the Organisation for Economic Co @-@ operation and Development ( OECD ) has its headquarters , but it is less significant for the financial sector than the ECB . &quot;
&quot; the proximity to the central bank is important for banks as they can communicate directly with the supervision , &quot; &quot; says I@@ W @-@ Professor Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; Luxembourg , though , covers a large fund industry , does not cut off the infrastructure in the same way as it does in Dublin . &quot;
Frankfurt is much easier to reach thanks to the large airport .
&quot; furthermore , the city focuses on easily available commercial real estate . &quot;
&quot; in Paris it is not easy to find high @-@ quality offices , &quot; says Vo@@ ig@@ t@@ länder . &quot;
&quot; at the Seine , the r@@ ents for first @-@ class commercial real estate are by 50 percent higher than in the Main . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Frankfurt offers a higher quality of life than competition thanks to good medical care and infrastructure as well as less crime . &quot;
&quot; in a ranking of the consulting firm Mer@@ cer , the city is ranked 7th , Luxemburg at No@@ .@@ 19 , Dublin at No. 33 and Paris in 3@@ 7th place . &quot;
&quot; even if quality of life is a question of preference , &quot; &quot; with its already strong position as a financial location for the European internal market , Frankfurt could attract more banks and investors , &quot; &quot; concluded the I@@ W . &quot;
&quot; but in spite of Bre@@ x@@ it @-@ V@@ ot@@ um , London will remain the most important financial centre in Europe , my econom@@ ist . &quot;
&quot; in the end of 2015 , according to figures from the Landes@@ bank Hel@@ aba at the end of 2015 , around 14@@ 4,000 people in the banking industry , in Frankfurt , were 6@@ 2500 . &quot;

&quot; in June Gilead was exemp@@ ted from a compens@@ atory payment of $ 200 million for the violation of two patents of Mer@@ ck , which were related to the block@@ bu@@ ster drugs so@@ val@@ di and Har@@ von@@ i of Gilead , after a US judge uncovered a pattern of mis@@ conduct on the part of Mer@@ ck , including the opinion and other un@@ ethical actions . &quot;
&quot; when the law@@ suit was raised on Thursday , U.S. official Beth Lab@@ son Fre@@ eman said that Gilead is entitled to the reduction of costs arising during the defence of the case . &quot;
&quot; Mer@@ ck is trying to syn@@ th@@ esi@@ ze the market of a new generation of hepatitis C medicines , which can heal over 90 percent of patients with liver disease . &quot;
&quot; the case goes back to 2013 when Gilead and Mer@@ ck filed each other and utilized properties on laboratory work , including sof@@ os@@ bu@@ vir bas@@ el@@ ag , active ingredient in the drugs of Gilead . &quot;
troops supported by the United States say they regain full control over Man@@ bi@@ j by the Islamic State
troops supported by the United States have conquered complete control over the northern city of Man@@ bi@@ j near the Turkish border after the last IS fighters left in the city said a spokes@@ man of the group on Friday .
&quot; the Democratic Forces of Syria ( D@@ KS ) , after the removal of the remaining group of fighters who have buried themselves within the city , are currently developing the city . &quot;
&quot; they have freed more than 2,000 civilians who were held ho@@ stages by the fighters , shares Shar@@ fan Dar@@ wish of the Man@@ bi@@ j Military Council Reu@@ ters allied with the D@@ KS . &quot;
&quot; the city is now under perfect control , but we just carry out clean @-@ up jobs , &quot; &quot; he told Reu@@ ters . &quot;
Clin@@ tons earn 10.@@ 75 million in 2015 and pay 3@@ 4.2 % federal taxes
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton announced on Friday her tax return for 2015 , which resulted in a USD 10.@@ 75 million in@@ comes and an effective federal tax rate of 3@@ 4.2 % for the Democrats and her husband . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , the Clinton Foundation donated $ 1 million for charitable purposes , mainly to the Clinton Foundation ; former Foreign Minister Bill Clinton accounts for USD 5.3 million in Rede@@ mption Money ; the former Foreign Minister issued an income of USD 3 million by Simon &amp; Schu@@ ster publishing house for her book about her term in the State Department . &quot;
&quot; Clinton &apos;s candidate for the Vice @-@ Pres@@ i@@ dency , Senator Tim Ka@@ ine of Virginia , published his tax statements of the last ten years with his wife Anne Hol@@ ton . &quot;
they paid an effective federal tax rate of 20.@@ 3 % in 2015 .
&quot; H@@ illary Clinton and Tim ka@@ ine continue to set standards regarding financial transparency , &quot; &quot; said Clinton &apos;s campaign hero J@@ enni@@ fer Pal@@ mier@@ i in an opinion . &quot;
&quot; in a stark contrast to this , Donald Tru@@ mp is hiding behind false statements and re@@ trac@@ ts regarding his promises so far to date . &quot;
&quot; it is common for US presidential candidates to publish their tax declarations , although they are not obliged to do so by law . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , a New York business@@ man , and his lawyers have declared a tax audit by the tax authorities as a reason for his refusal . &quot;
&quot; they are on the move , &quot; writes Clinton &apos;s election campaign hero Ian S@@ ams on Twitter , with regard to the publication of the presidential candidate of the Democrats . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Michael Coh@@ en , Tru@@ mp Special Consult@@ ant , said to CN@@ N that he would not allow Tru@@ mp to publish something before tax inspections are not completed . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp critics , including the Republi@@ can presidential candidate of 2012 Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney , have already announced that his refusal questions regarding wealth , his donations for charitable organisations , his contributions and various other connections , especially with Russia . &quot;
&quot; Clinton has already fallen on the subject and released a video on the internet on Friday , asking the high ranking Republi@@ can Tru@@ mp to publish his tax return . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , she also addressed the topic during a speech on the economy in Mich@@ igan . &quot;
&quot; he refuses to do what any other presidential candidate has done in the last decades and to publish his tax declarations . &quot; &quot; she said to the crowd . &quot;
&quot; politicians have reported that during the 1990s , Tru@@ mp has paid no or only very few taxes , and a business journalist of the New York Times quoted a number of tax lawyers and tax consultants on Friday , stating that this could still be the case . &quot;
&quot; in the election campaign , federal taxes have become an issue . &quot;
Clinton is supporting a scheme named after billi@@ on@@ aire and investor War@@ ren Buff@@ ett who would ensure that individuals who earn more than USD 1 million will pay a tax rate of at least 30 % .
President Obama also supports the proposal .
&quot; during an election campaign for H@@ illary Clinton last week in O@@ ma@@ ha , Neb@@ ras@@ ka asked Buff@@ ett , whose Ber@@ k@@ shire H@@ ath@@ away industrial con@@ glomer@@ ate has its headquarters here , to exchange Tru@@ mp at a meeting to discuss their tax statements . &quot;
&quot; Buff@@ ett said he was also subjected to a tax check by the I@@ RS and Tru@@ mp has &quot; &quot; fear &quot; &quot; from voters and not in front of tax authorities . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s campaign has released a tax return from 2007 to 2007 .
&quot; the Clin@@ tons , who now live in Ch@@ app@@ aqu@@ a , New York , paid an effective federal tax rate of approx . 32 % between 2007 and 2014 and an effective combined tax rate of approx . 4@@ 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; Clin@@ ton &apos;s tax return from 2015 showed that these are only USD 100 of their income as wages , unlike most Americans . &quot;
&quot; their main investment was a cost @-@ effective Inde@@ x@@ Fund , from which the Clin@@ ton &apos;s divi@@ den@@ ds and earnings of USD 10@@ 9@@ ,000 were tax@@ ed . &quot;

con@@ doms with ch@@ ili@@ powder and fire@@ works promote Tanz@@ ani@@ as elephant protection
conserv@@ ation@@ ists in Tanzania use an un@@ orthodox way to prevent eleph@@ ants from going out inhabited settlements - they throw con@@ doms on them filled with ch@@ ili@@ es .
&quot; the method has proven to be effective and the Hon@@ ey@@ guide Foundation , which already had the idea for years , has intensified its promotion together with U.S. nature protection by training volunteers in villages in northern Tanzania , without viol@@ ating animals without viol@@ ating animals . &quot;
&quot; before that , many sp@@ ears have used to defend themselves . &quot;
Friday is World Phone Day dedicated to animal welfare .
&quot; since we have developed the ... Tool@@ kit , we have been able to observe a change in their attitude within these communities , and they are much more confident that they can stop the eleph@@ ants from their fields without har@@ ming the elephant &quot; , &quot; said the managing director of Hon@@ ey@@ guide Dam@@ ian Bell in a message . &quot;
the first two steps include the illumin@@ ating of the elephant with a torch and the bubbles in a horn .
&quot; if it is not deter@@ red , a so @-@ called &quot; &quot; Chi@@ li@@ wol@@ ke &quot; &quot; is thrown . &quot;
&quot; mixed with earth is packed into a con@@ dom together with a fire@@ work body , whose end is turned to the spark plug . &quot;
&quot; when it is lit , the con@@ dom bur@@ sts with a pop and spray fine dust on ch@@ ili@@ pow@@ ders into the air . &quot;
a hint is usually already out to ch@@ ase the elephant .
&quot; one last chance represents a thro@@ wer , who shoots a gold @-@ burning fire@@ work in the air and thereby causes a noisy , light explosion . &quot;
city council decides unanim@@ ously : no ki@@ osk building at the St. Go@@ ar@@ er Rhein@@ u@@ fer
&quot; normally , the St. Go@@ ar@@ er &apos;s investment projects in commercial vehicles take place with K@@ us@@ sh@@ and - however , the retail sector in the core city is considered to be clearly exp@@ and@@ able . &quot;
&quot; the City Council , however , unanim@@ ously rejected the application for the new building of a sales ski@@ pper at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer in the immediate vicinity of the Rhine balcony . &quot;
&quot; in principle , we welcome new business@@ men , but at this location in exposed location at the Rhein@@ u@@ fer this ki@@ osk doesn &apos;t fit , &quot; &quot; explained Michael Hu@@ br@@ ath for the CD@@ U Group . &quot;
&quot; Jewish director sm@@ ashes Berlin Hotel , because Israeli pre @-@ election was removed after &quot; Arab &quot; invitation - RT News &quot;
&quot; a French director with Jewish roots un@@ le@@ ashed a media watch after betra@@ ying that the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin didn &apos;t list Israeli pre @-@ election , as Arabic guests had &quot; &quot; requested &quot; &quot; according to an employee . &quot;
&quot; Claude Lanz@@ mann , author of the Holocaust documentation &quot; Sho@@ ah &quot; sent his anger at the Kemp@@ inski B@@ rist@@ ol Hotel in Berlin , writing an open letter to the German newspaper FA@@ Z . &quot;
&quot; during his last stay , Lanz@@ mann tried to find Israel on the country &apos;s country code list . &quot;
&quot; however , the country was not listed among the countries that could be inv@@ oked directly from the hotel room . &quot;
&quot; how is it possible in 2016 in Berlin , the capital of the new Germany , that Israel was eliminated and deleted ? &quot;
wrote Lanz@@ mann .
&quot; instead , the Kemp@@ in@@ ks@@ i B@@ rist@@ ol offers an opportunity to choose Israel through its own call center . &quot;
&quot; looking for an explanation , the director turned to the hotel reception . &quot;
&quot; the answer he received there , &quot; ch@@ oked him , &quot; as Lanz@@ mann wrote . &quot;
the hotel employee said the measure was &quot; deliber@@ ate decision by the management of the Kemp@@ inski Hotels . &quot;
the reason behind it dis@@ b@@ anded even more fur@@ y in the director .
&quot; most of our guests are Arabs and they have demanded that the pre @-@ election is deleted , &quot; &quot; the employee of Lanz@@ mann was quoted . &quot;
&quot; the Israeli ambassador in Germany Y@@ ak@@ ov Ha@@ das @-@ Handels@@ man called this a &quot; &quot; big dis@@ grace &quot; , &quot; reports the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung . &quot;
we were app@@ alled and troubled by this event .
this is really very embarrass@@ ing .
&quot; the fact that this has happened in Germany in exactly this hotel chain , is even an even greater shame . &quot;
this does not require any explanation .
&quot; we expect the hotel to draw the right conclusions , &quot; &quot; said the minister . &quot;
&quot; the incident triggered a rather large resonance on the Internet , where people called it a sc@@ andal . &quot;
some subordin@@ ated the Kemp@@ inski Hotel that it would have given the alleged alle@@ gations of Arab guests .
&quot; be ashamed , &quot; said it in another article , in which it was pointed out that the hotel situated at the noble Kur@@ für@@ st@@ end@@ amm is near a synagogue . &quot;
&quot; the hotel quickly instructed all the charges and called the incident an &quot; &quot; see &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; exc@@ used &quot; &quot; in Lanz@@ mann , reports Der Spiegel . &quot;
&quot; there was never a direct order &quot; not to include Israel in the fast electoral list , &quot; the Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung quoted a spokes@@ man of the Kemp@@ inski Hotel . &quot;
adds that the country code has been added .
police sets tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against prot@@ esting Brazilian students
students met with the police on Thursday in the Brazilian city of Sao Paulo as they gathered to protest against the government &apos;s reforms for the public education system .
the police put tear gas and rubber bul@@ lets against the demonstr@@ ators .
&quot; the difficulties began , as police officers tried to disper@@ se the students , which led to the police rub@@ bing rubber bul@@ lets and tear gas . &quot;
several hundred students participated in the demonstrations to express their const@@ ern@@ ation on the plans .
&quot; according to the proposals by the Gover@@ nor of the federal state Sao Paulo Ger@@ aldo Al@@ ck@@ min , a little less than 100 public schools will be closed while 300@@ ,000 students are implemented to save money . &quot;
some of the protest participants were seen gra@@ ff@@ iti against the provisional president Michel Tem@@ er on walls .
&quot; the recent protests took place several days after prot@@ esters in masses went on the streets to support the suspended President Dil@@ ma Rous@@ se@@ ff , who had been dismissed from office by a vote of the Senate . &quot;
trade between Russia &amp; Iran suddenly rises to 71 % - RT Business
&quot; with the lifting of the sanctions , according to the Russian ambassador in Iran , Lev@@ an D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan , the trade turnover between Moscow and Te@@ hr@@ an grew by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the year . &quot;
&quot; since the international sanctions against Iran were lifted , interest in Russian enterprises was growing strongly in business in the country , the ambassador said . &quot;
&quot; Russian companies are taking up existing connections with Iran , while new companies are ready to gain access to the market . &quot;
&quot; of course , further trade expansion is one of the biggest priorities of bilateral cooperation with Iran , &quot; &quot; said D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan . &quot;
he noted that the trade turnover between Russia and Iran rose by 7@@ 0.@@ 9 percent in the first five months of 2016 compared to the same period in 2015 and $ 8@@ 56 million .
&quot; in particular , Russian imports in Iran rose by 9@@ 1.5 percent and amounted to $ 6@@ 97 million . &quot;
Russian imports from Iran rose by 16 percent to $ 158 million .
&quot; the trade fair was achieved by deliveries of machinery , land vehicles and weapons , &quot; &quot; said the ambassador . &quot;
&quot; for this year , D@@ z@@ ha@@ gar@@ yan comes from a record number of Iranian tourists in Russia . &quot;
&quot; last year , Russian foreign representatives gave approximately 35@@ ,000 Vis@@ as , primarily travel vis@@ as , to Iranian citizens . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Iran reached the top 20 countries in terms of the number of tourist arri@@ vals in Russia . &quot;
&quot; one could say that the record numbers of Iranian tourists in Russia last year broke , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , only relatively few Russians visit Iran , something that the ambassador hopes for it to change . &quot;
&quot; I personally can recommend visiting the cities of Is@@ f@@ ah@@ an , Shi@@ ra@@ z and Y@@ az@@ d who have preserved the monuments of the old Persian civilization in a good state , &quot; he said . &quot;
looking for vou@@ chers : beverage market in Wald@@ br@@ öl
a rob@@ ber@@ y case has been practi@@ sed on Thursday evening on the beverage market from Re@@ we XXL at the Wald@@ br@@ ö@@ ler Ger@@ ber@@ straße .
&quot; under the restra@@ int of a fire@@ arm , three dark @-@ dressed people , who had m@@ um@@ bled their faces , demanded the issuing of cash from the drink bar and then fled at first and then probably with a silver @-@ colored VW Golf . &quot;
&quot; how much money has been captured , the police do not share . &quot;
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators should have been between 1.@@ 60 and 1.@@ 70 meters large , thus relatively small . &quot;
the beverage market is directly accessible and poorly visible from the parking deck of the Re@@ we market .
&quot; the perpetr@@ ators will have to flee towards Ger@@ ber@@ straße in the direction of Ger@@ ber@@ straße , Friedrich @-@ Engel@@ bert @-@ Weg and be wing@@ ed with the silver @-@ colored car opposite the car park entrance , possibly in the direction of B 256 ( Schla@@ der@@ n@@ ring ) . &quot;
&quot; who made observations at the time of the action ( at 7 : 45 p.m. ) , who are in connection with the rob@@ ber@@ y fall , should report urgently with the police . &quot;
Nag@@ old : play and fun during summer break
&quot; eight beautiful and happy days spent the children and young people of the socially educational day group / social group work of the child protection association Nag@@ old with their assistants on their summer holiday in N@@ uss@@ dorf , near Müh@@ lack@@ er . &quot;
&quot; in the quiet area of Lei@@ tw@@ äl@@ dle , the life @-@ joyful group was quartered during the first week of school holidays . &quot;
several full day trips were on the agenda .
on the one hand it went to save with a visit to the stro@@ el@@ z@@ oos .
&quot; on the other hand , after Maul@@ bron@@ n , where there was a special children &apos;s guide in the world famous monastery . &quot;
the third excursion led to Pfor@@ z@@ heim .
&quot; in the Kel@@ ten@@ museum in Hoch@@ dorf , the group learned a lot about the daily life and food of the Cel@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; on the hot days the group was delighted at the deep sea in Maul@@ bron@@ n , which invited to jump , swim and p@@ addle . &quot;
&quot; children and car@@ ers with their self @-@ prepared body @-@ courses such as the Sau@@ ren Sp@@ ätz@@ le , the Seeb@@ ron@@ ner Pf@@ än@@ n@@ le , I@@ sel@@ sh@@ aus@@ er @-@ Blo@@ ff , the English @-@ Breakfast and T@@ üb@@ inger Bolog@@ n@@ ese were treated to culinary delights . &quot;
&quot; in workshops there was cur@@ ated , beautiful beads made of pearls and stones or made of wood a Roman mill game . &quot;
&quot; further highlights of the free time were fishing in a nearby pond , the evenings at the fire and the final &quot; Bun@@ te evening . &quot; &quot;
on the day of the voyage home the sun laugh@@ ed and the children and young people returned home satisfied .
Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch : pilgri@@ m to the gate of mercy
the mini@@ atur@@ ists from the pastoral care unit E@@ yach@@ tal @-@ Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch St. Anna were on the way on a four @-@ day pilgrimage from Vil@@ lingen to Freiburg .
&quot; together , four stages were met . &quot;
&quot; in order to bridge the time up to the next pilgrimage of all Mini@@ stran@@ ts in two years , the Upper Ministers of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and conduct a several @-@ day pilgrimage . &quot;
&quot; various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided in favour of the Ep@@ is@@ cop@@ al City of Fri@@ bourg , where , during the Holy Year of Mer@@ cy , a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Freiburg Min@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; 16 Min@@ is of B@@ itt@@ el@@ bron@@ n , Gru@@ ben@@ sh@@ ole , and Ha@@ ig@@ er@@ loch , and the hal@@ lowed rooms set themselves in the way . &quot;
&quot; in the evening before , pastor Stor@@ ost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna , blessed the Pil@@ gri@@ mage Cru@@ ces and told the pilgrims . &quot;
&quot; from Hor@@ b we drove by train to the starting point Vil@@ lingen , where also a Münster Un@@ ser@@ er was standing and so the pilgrimage route took place from Münster . &quot;
&quot; the single day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening with a short impulse , with different prayers , songs and writing texts . &quot;
&quot; but also on the way , the Min@@ is on field crosses , chap@@ els or churches again and again R@@ ast to sing a song from specially assembled pilgri@@ m song . &quot;
&quot; for the overnight stays , the parish homes of the local par@@ ishes were available . &quot;
&quot; at the stage destinations , Alexandra Burk@@ hardt and Hei@@ di F@@ aller ensured a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast . &quot;
&quot; on the second day , we continued through Fur@@ tw@@ angen to Gü@@ ten@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; the day after that , one stepped on the stage to St. Peter , which was the most stren@@ uous route , but at first some 500 al@@ timet@@ ers had to be lowered and afterwards climbed again . &quot;
the deserved reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pool in the evening .
&quot; after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter , we went to Freiburg . &quot;
&quot; visi@@ bly facilit@@ ated and happy , the Min@@ is arrived at the Freiburg Min@@ ster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy . &quot;
with a small impulse God was given thanks .
&quot; at the evening mass in Münster , the Min@@ is arrived on the pilgri@@ m &apos;s destination by Ko@@ operator Markus Ober@@ t . &quot;
&quot; after the divine service , the pilgrims were able to visit the sac@@ rist@@ y and high altar . &quot;
the next day was still time for the metropolis .
in the afternoon we went back to Hor@@ b by train .
&quot; at the end , all participants agreed that the days of spirituality and a strong community experience were marked . &quot;
Scot@@ sman Call@@ um Sk@@ inner storms home when Br@@ ite wins gold for cycling
Scotland &apos;s Call@@ um Sk@@ inner last evening in the men &apos;s racing car Sprint in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012 .
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old from Glasgow took the anchor roll , who had made his fellow country@@ man Sir Chris Ho@@ y to E@@ igen . &quot;
England claimed a sho@@ cking victory four years ago while Ho@@ y won the fifth of six Olympic medals .
they repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships despite the Ho@@ ys reg@@ atta .
the problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff .
they did this in time as execution .
Ho@@ ys retired en@@ gen@@ dered a gap that Ki@@ an E@@ ma@@ di and Matt Cra@@ mp@@ ton tried to close .
Sk@@ inner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the bul@@ k@@ head that has now un@@ folded .
&quot; Hin@@ der , Kenn@@ y - the four years ago with Ho@@ y victorious - and Sk@@ inner made an Olympic record in the qualification rounds , but in the standard rounds the New Ze@@ al@@ anders won the first round . &quot;
and the British trio won the du@@ el with gold .
&quot; after his lap , Hin@@ der was barely back , but Kenn@@ y brought the team forward and Sk@@ inner held it . &quot;
&quot; a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation , moving in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenn@@ y and above all Sk@@ inner to keep pace . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ y looked at his position as BBC expert and noticed Sk@@ inner , Kenn@@ y and Hin@@ ds when they climbed onto the podium . &quot;
&quot; the 23 @-@ year @-@ old Sk@@ inner from Glasgow said : &quot; &quot; it &apos;s a fl@@ attering comparison . &quot;
I &apos;m just here to do my best and make a name .
we have set up a olymp@@ ar@@ ec@@ ord in the final round and defeated the World Champion .
it was just unbelievable .
there is no better way to win this .
&quot; after the 2012 triumph at Kenn@@ y &apos;s and Ho@@ ys side , there was a hint that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track . &quot;
he later returned this statement and there was no objection to England &apos;s ri@@ vals .
&quot; with such an outstanding victory , this time there was no such issue . &quot;
&quot; Hin@@ der said , &quot; &quot; It feels like the whole UK flags on the tri@@ b@@ une like London . &quot;
we have joined together as a team in the last three months .
we did so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics .
&quot; this is an event , a gold medal for the nation , which were won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London . &quot;
&quot; if this is a bar@@ ometer of our progress over the last five months , we expect successful five days in the velo@@ drome . &quot;
&quot; with the form of Kenn@@ y , it is possible to repeat Ho@@ ys &apos;s victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition . &quot;
&quot; that would be for Kenn@@ y , who was born exactly 12 years younger than Ho@@ y , who was also born on March 23rd ( a seemingly holy date for British sports ; on that day also Steve Red@@ grave , Mo Far@@ ah and Roger Ban@@ ni@@ ster were born ) - an abundance of six gold medals and a silver medal . &quot;
that would be the same as Ho@@ y .
&quot; Kenn@@ y is next in the Sprint , which starts today and will go for more than three days . &quot;
the 28 @-@ year @-@ old from Bol@@ ton said : &quot; I only enjoy this for the moment . &quot;
the team event is always best .
you can win it with his colleagues .
it feels a bit lonely to win alone .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; If he wins two more gold medals , he should be beaten to the k@@ night . &quot;
&quot; it was the only medal competition of the day , but there were other good news for England . &quot;
&quot; Sir Bra@@ dly W@@ ig@@ gins , Ed C@@ lan@@ cy , Steven Bur@@ ke and O@@ wa@@ in Dou@@ ll qualified with the fastest performance in the four @-@ kilometer race . &quot;
they arrived at the destination in 3 : 5@@ 1.@@ 9@@ 42 .
&quot; the world record , which won gold in London in 2012 , was 3 : 5@@ 1,@@ 6@@ 59 . &quot;
&quot; the first and final round ( 22.@@ 42 ) will take place today on the second day of the competition , where W@@ ig@@ gins will be focusing on safety . &quot;
&quot; yesterday , he had cont@@ ested with delegates before the qualification , when officials called him to measure his height . &quot;
&quot; Laura Trot@@ t , Jo@@ anna R@@ ow@@ sell S@@ hand@@ ong , E@@ lin@@ or B@@ arker and K@@ atie Archi@@ bald of Mil@@ n@@ g@@ avi@@ e in World Record Time in 4 : 13,@@ 260 . &quot;
the UK team relies on his strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a band of medals .
&quot; after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute domin@@ ance in Beijing and London , the expectations for Rio were shut down . &quot;
&quot; there were drama in the background , so the res@@ ignation of the technical director Sh@@ ane S@@ ut@@ ton in April amidst sex@@ ism and mo@@ bbing pen@@ alties as well as retirement of sizes like Ho@@ y and Victoria Pend@@ let@@ on . &quot;
&quot; however , if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velo@@ drome , it looks like the legendary reputation G@@ Bs , which reached its peak at the perfect moment , could be repeated again . &quot;
future of the melting of Port@@ land due to the lifting of the energy yield
&quot; the future of the aluminium melting of Port@@ land in Victoria - as well as hundreds of work@@ stations of workers - are at stake , as the plant operator termin@@ ates the energy supply contract and thereby canc@@ els all supply contracts , such as the supplying energy company . &quot;
&quot; this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria beginning of this year , no further subsidies to operate the plant . &quot;
a subsi@@ dy for 20 years will exp@@ ire in November .
up to 2000 jobs in the system of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land are at stake .
no less than 2000 jobs -@@ direct and indirect - could be at risk at closure .
&quot; in addition , it could come to dom@@ ino effects , since the melt @-@ dairy consum@@ es around 10 percent of the total electricity generation at Victori@@ as . &quot;
&quot; in 2014 , Al@@ coa joined Point Henry Schmel@@ zer , which last year led to a closure of the Angl@@ es@@ ea power plant . &quot;
the mel@@ t@@ down of Al@@ coa in Port@@ land loses money and risks closure .
&quot; this step follows the years of speculation with regard to the future of the plant , originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L , which supplies the large aluminium melt with its Lo@@ y Y@@ ang A power plant in Lat@@ ro@@ be Valley , announced that three other owners will announce their contracts . &quot;
&quot; the plant is owned by a joint venture of Al@@ coa and Al@@ um@@ ina , of which the Chinese company C@@ IT@@ IC and the Japanese Mar@@ ub@@ eni Cor@@ p hold smaller portions . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Port@@ land , which means further physical demand for electricity by sm@@ el@@ ting , &quot; &quot; said the company . &quot;
&quot; AG@@ L continued to say that the contracts were &quot; &quot; hed@@ ging transactions &quot; , &quot; which should have entered into force in November 2016 . &quot;
&quot; the contracts have a 12 month notice period , so that they will end in 2017 . &quot;
&quot; as a result , AG@@ L assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues , &quot; &quot; said the electricity supplier . &quot;
forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change .
AG@@ L reported that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual subscription in the amount of $ 18@@ 7 million in &quot; expecting a cancellation . &quot;
&quot; Al@@ coa said the decision to book the contracts , the &quot; ability of Al@@ co@@ as ... to run the sm@@ el@@ ting or to ensure the power supply to the melt &quot; does not interfere . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. company said it had concluded a 20 @-@ year contract with Lo@@ y Y@@ ang in 2010 , which should have entered into force from November this year even if there is yet another explanation why it has res@@ igned from the contract . &quot;
analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry prior to the possible closure of the Port@@ land Schmel@@ ing in Victoria and the Tom@@ ago facility near New@@ castle .
&quot; in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week , the Head of Operations Stephen Mik@@ kel@@ sen said that Port@@ land uses around 600 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity per year to consume around 900 meg@@ a@@ watts of electricity . &quot;
&quot; should both systems disappear from the market , this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the &#91; electricity market &#93; . &quot;
&quot; and for us as a generator it wouldn &apos;t be good , &quot; he said . &quot;

&quot; K@@ end@@ all , the brand ambassador of Est@@ ée Lau@@ der and ran to fashion We@@ eks in Milan , Paris and New York , announced on Thursday the news on its Inst@@ agra@@ m account . &quot;
&quot; in a room full of people I love , the sight of this cover made me cry , &quot; K@@ end@@ all wrote . &quot;
&quot; disclosure of the cover followed a bizarre ( or simply Ke@@ eping Up with the Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans like ? ) , watched reality video showing the entire Kar@@ das@@ hi@@ an Jen@@ ner family ( with the exception of Ro@@ b and Ca@@ it@@ ly@@ n &apos;s most popular Show@@ bi@@ z un@@ cles and producers of Ke@@ eping Up R@@ yan Se@@ ac@@ orn ) . &quot;
&quot; this represents the c@@ lich@@ é @-@ based plot almost every birthday episode of a children &apos;s show ( Se@@ ac@@ orn brought the sentence &quot; &quot; You thought we had forgotten you ? &quot; &quot; with the hon@@ esty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o &apos;clock in the morning ) , but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity . &quot;
&quot; with regard to the September edition of the Vo@@ gue , surely a new era of kar@@ das@@ hi@@ ans began . &quot;
&quot; K@@ end@@ all &apos;s big sister Kim likes her , as for the Vo@@ gue cover ( she and her husband K@@ any@@ e West were to be seen in April 2014 ) , but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself . &quot;
the September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vo@@ gue .
&quot; with a circum@@ ference that resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine , the issue draws a large number of advertis@@ ers ( L@@ aut Fas@@ hi@@ on@@ ista were advertisement from the 8@@ 32 pages of the tome 6@@ 15 pages advertising ) . &quot;
the revelation of his cover star is so eag@@ erly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still se@@ ep before the official announcement .
&quot; women already on the cover include Na@@ omi Camp@@ bell , Linda Evangel@@ ista and Kate Mos@@ s . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , there were clearly more celeb@@ ri@@ ties that mod@@ elled &quot; &quot; models that are celeb@@ ri@@ ties &quot; &quot; on the cover . &quot;
&quot; Oscar prize winner and designer J@@ enni@@ fer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013 , one year after Lady G@@ aga had the honor . &quot;
&quot; but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jen@@ ner - who is described by the magazine as the &quot; &quot; breakthrough model &quot; &quot; of her generation - falls under the earlier category , she is in good company . &quot;
these celeb@@ ri@@ ties aren &apos;t related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers today who know how to make a good snapshot video ( even if everything is true of Jen@@ ner ) .
they are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry .
&quot; Be@@ y@@ once , who appeared on the last cover , had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lem@@ on@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; of course , J@@ enn@@ ers do not like success to everyone . &quot;
&quot; with its reality TV story , J@@ enn@@ ers &apos;s position in the world of fashion was always somewhat ten@@ se . &quot;
in June the former Victoria &apos;s Secret @-@ model Steph@@ anie Se@@ ym@@ our Jen@@ ner and her colleague Gig@@ i Ha@@ did critici@@ zed and called them &quot; the mi@@ st@@ asy of the moment . &quot;
these feelings turned up again when the message came out with the appearance of J@@ enn@@ ers on the Vo@@ gue cover .
but lying around on the disp@@ le@@ as@@ ure seems to pass by at the point .
K@@ end@@ all Jen@@ ner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vo@@ gue .
it is a super@@ model in the tru@@ est sense of the word .
it runs for Marc Jac@@ obs .
it makes advertising for your pri@@ mer by Est@@ ee Lau@@ der .
she and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective pay@@ wall apps .
she sells her made pictures of C@@ ind@@ y Cra@@ w@@ for@@ ds &apos;s daughter to the magazine LOVE .
and in her leisure time she is in reality TV . probably only to see her sister K@@ our@@ t@@ ney and her children .
&quot; municipal law centres show 160@@ ,000 people a year &quot;
&quot; more than 160@@ ,000 of the country &apos;s auxiliary services are rejected by the community centres every year , while the industry is taking on the effects of further short@@ cuts to already over@@ loaded transactions . &quot;
&quot; in Que@@ ens@@ land , three out of five people - mostly older people , immigrants , needy people , victims of violence and those who have no means of un@@ just del@@ o@@ gi@@ z@@ ations and the like - are rejected at their request for free legal advice and legal assistance . &quot;
&quot; legal services of the municipality , which are already over@@ loaded , are ready for further cuts . &quot;
&quot; as of June next year , these legal centers will lose another 30 percent of their federal funds . &quot;
&quot; the director of the community centers of Que@@ es@@ land James Far@@ rel@@ l said that the last survey of the National Association of Community law centres , concluded that thousands of people were refused each year . &quot;
Far@@ rel@@ l said the situation would only be worse without the abolition of the decision of the Federal Government .
&quot; Que@@ ens@@ land &apos;s shared centres are chron@@ ically under@@ funded , meaning that thousands of people of important services you need are rejected , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; people who leave violent relations , people with uns@@ ur@@ passed and oppres@@ sive debts , families that have been dismissed by separ@@ ations , workers who have been un@@ ju@@ stly dismissed - all these people have problems of legal nature and this survey shows that they cannot receive the help they need . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will cut its funding by 30 percent as of June 2017 , which means that thousands of needy people from Que@@ ens@@ land will be forced to cope with their legal problems without any help . &quot;
&quot; we call on the General At@@ tor@@ ney and Justice Minister as well as Sen@@ ators of Que@@ ens@@ land George Bran@@ dis to immediately raise these short@@ cuts , so that people can get the help they need in case of legal problems . &quot;
&quot; last year , the provincial government had fulfilled its commitment to raise funds for right @-@ wing aid to the national average . &quot;
it is now time to look at the needs of the community centres and their communities and that the government of Pal@@ as@@ z@@ c@@ zu@@ k inv@@ ests in this important work .
Donald Tru@@ mp indic@@ ted after employees allegedly pulled weapons
new York : Donald Tru@@ mp Campa@@ ign has been accused of alleged in@@ action after being informed that her campaign manager for North Carolina put a fire@@ arm on an employee while traveling in a je@@ ep in February .
&quot; the incident is described in an indictment , which was filed on Wednesday in Charlotte Regional Court by Vincent B@@ ordin@@ i , a former software program@@ mer for the campaign in this state . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ord@@ i began to have waited for months for the matter to be settled internally before he realized that &quot; &quot; this would not happen . &quot;
&quot; the campaign leader , Ear@@ l Philip , &quot; drew a gun , put his right finger on the trigger , and put the race in Vinc@@ ent Kni@@ ek@@ eh@@ le , &quot; he announced in his indictment . &quot;
&quot; after having appe@@ aled to the local and regional campaign leadership , B@@ ordin@@ i noted that at least four other persons had had the same experience with Phil@@ lip , he admitted to the indictment . &quot;
&quot; weapons must not be fired to cause damage , &quot; &quot; said B@@ ord@@ i . &quot;
&quot; the prosecution comes only two days after the Republi@@ can presidential candidate spark@@ ed a tur@@ mo@@ il when he said a crowd in North Carolina , that the Second A@@ mend@@ ment People were to take action if his rival@@ ry H@@ illary Clinton was elected and judge . &quot;
Tru@@ mp campaign clearly indicated that the media would have pulled out its words from the context and that it would not inc@@ ite violence .
ordin@@ ance Com@@ pla@@ int demands compensation from the campaign for the violation of the duty of care and of Philip for bodily injury and lasting emotional damage .
Tru@@ mp Press spokesperson on Hope Hi@@ cks was not to be reached for a statement .
attempts to contact Philip failed as well .
&quot; W@@ C@@ CB , a local news channel in Charlotte , reports that Phil@@ lip is no longer a member of the campaign . &quot;
&quot; responding to calls with his consulting company , Innov@@ ative Consulting Services , has not been re@@ acted . &quot;
the Republi@@ can presidential candidate Donald Tru@@ mp has so far led a controversial campaign .

Berlin / Schwer@@ in : survey before countries elections : the SPD and the CD@@ U lose
&quot; in the upcoming elections in the federal states of Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern ( September 4 ) and Berlin ( September 18 ) , considerable losses for the SPD and CD@@ U are characterised . &quot;
this gave representative surveys of the opinion research institute IN@@ SA for the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Friday ) .
&quot; while the red @-@ black government coalition in the north could not go@@ vern , this is not possible after the survey values in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; in both German states , the SPD would be the strongest party and would have good chances to continue putting the head of government . &quot;
&quot; in Mecklenburg @-@ Vorpommern , the SPD fell from 3@@ 5.@@ 6 percent to 24 percent five years ago . &quot;
&quot; according to the survey , the party was only slightly ahead of the CD@@ U , which could come back to 23 percent . &quot;
the third place is controversial between the left and the Af@@ D .
&quot; the left would come to 19 percent ( previously 18.@@ 4 percent ) , the Af@@ D would be represented at 19 percent for the first time in the Land@@ tag . &quot;
&quot; despite light losses , the Gre@@ ens were reluct@@ ant to return to Schwer@@ in Land@@ tag despite slight losses ( before 8.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
N@@ PD and F@@ DP were not represented in the Land@@ tag with 3 percent each .
&quot; according to the Berlin Chamber of Dep@@ u@@ ties , according to the survey , the SPD should only reach 23 percent ( election 2011 : 28.@@ 3 percent ) . &quot;
the CD@@ U reached only 18 percent after 23.@@ 4 percent .
&quot; in this way , it is still behind the Gre@@ ens at 19 percent ( 2011 : 17.@@ 6 percent ) , but ahead of the left with 15 percent ( previously 11.@@ 7 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; at 14 percent , the Af@@ D would be represented in the House of Dep@@ u@@ ties for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to 2011 , the F@@ DP could hope to return with 5 percent . &quot;
Nokia 9000 Communic@@ ator : the first smartphone
&quot; email and Internet in slow motion : 20 years ago , Nokia communic@@ ator came to the market . &quot;
the success@@ ors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster .
the device weighed almost half a kil@@ ogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5 .
&quot; it was thicker and bigger , so it was not good in the hand . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary , it was quite p@@ unk@@ y . &quot;
&quot; the built @-@ in memory initially amounted to eight meg@@ ab@@ ytes , which would be enough for about two sel@@ fies with high resolution . &quot;
an iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gi@@ gab@@ ytes .
&quot; the Nokia 9000 communic@@ ator came into business exactly 20 years ago , on August 15 , 1996 , and it was the first smartphone . &quot;
&quot; for a few euros , fans can buy the equipment on the internet , but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age . &quot;
&quot; 20 years ago , however , the communic@@ ator was a sensation . &quot;
&quot; the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair C@@ eb@@ it in Hanover as &quot; &quot; Office in Western pocket format &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in fact , the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards : SMS and e @-@ mails could be sent and received , even by fax was the communic@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; even the access to web pages was possible using HTML browsers , albeit tor@@ menting slowly . &quot;
&quot; a calcul@@ ator was available , a digital address book and an electronic calendar . &quot;
&quot; there was a small antenna , and the mobile phone could be folded up like a laptop . &quot;
then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen .
&quot; the price was quite proud : 27@@ 00 D @-@ Mark , i.e. about 1400 Euro . &quot;
the average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 3@@ 92 euros in 2015 .
no one could suspect in August 1996 that the communic@@ ator would be the beginning of the smartphone era .
&quot; since then , everything is different . &quot;
&quot; the smart phones are a success story , though not for Nokia . &quot;
&quot; the Finn@@ s &quot; mobile phone line experienced an unprecedented disaster , eventually being sold and handled at Microsoft . &quot;
&quot; today , the market is dominated by suppliers who all came much later than Nokia . &quot;
&quot; always and everywhere online , that is today for very many people everyday lives . &quot;
&quot; in 2015 , there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide . &quot;
&quot; approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold , on Samsung and Apple accounted for 5@@ 55 million units . &quot;
the worldwide turnover with the equipment is around 400 billion euros .
this includes the well @-@ running business of the countless app vendors and telecommunications companies .
&quot; in the meantime , a whole industry has been created around the smartphone . &quot;
&quot; the decisive breakthrough on the mass market came only at the beginning of 2007 , then Apple CEO Steve Jobs on the Mac @-@ World announced the introduction of the iPhone . &quot;
&quot; he promised three devices in one : a music player , a phone and an internet communic@@ ator , all easy to use via touch screen . &quot;
&quot; the trium@@ ph@@ al march of Apple began , even today , the iPhone is the most important product of the company . &quot;
&quot; Nokia , Motor@@ ola and Black@@ berry , who dominated the market , had a look at it . &quot;
&quot; she finally disappeared , Black@@ berry has to fight . &quot;
the Sa@@ y now have Apple and Asian providers like Samsung .
the smartphone is a matter of course 20 years after his invention .
&quot; on average , each German now looks 88 times a day on his mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; we all need to learn to take the Smartphone away , &quot; said Jan@@ ina Ball , responsible for the Siemens Executive Board . &quot;
permanent availability is now regarded as a curse and blessing at the same time .
England must direct the Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw
He@@ a@@ throw will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country .
&quot; for me , this was the biggest attraction of He@@ a@@ throw , just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games . &quot;
the Olympi@@ ad brought great benefits to Str@@ at@@ ford and the East End .
and we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies close to He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; for our local communities , we are already going to create 10,000 new apprentices@@ hips , 40,000 new jobs and put an end to youth unemployment in the airport environment . &quot;
&quot; as they were ahead in London 2012 , there will be those who will think that the challenge of En@@ lar@@ gement is too big . &quot;
I was told that England will never be ready for the games and that we will be bl@@ amed on the world stage .
the doub@@ ters had wron@@ ged 2012 and they will also be wrong at He@@ a@@ throw .
&quot; there are always obstacles to overcoming , but He@@ a@@ throw answers every question asked him . &quot;
&quot; like the Olympic Games , He@@ a@@ throw is for many and not for individual an infrastructure project . &quot;
&quot; expansion is a way to create up to 180@@ ,000 new jobs , creating £ 2@@ 11 billion in am@@ using growth and leaving a legacy of skills and employment both in the airport and in the UK . &quot;
&quot; we have implemented a great team in He@@ a@@ throw , which implemented a £ 11 billion expensive infrastructure investment program in time and budget , from T@@ 5 - the five years in a row to the world &apos;s best airport terminal , to T@@ 2 , which was built in the middle of the two most frequ@@ ented cat@@ walks in the world . &quot;
&quot; now they are ready to deliver a third cat@@ walk , which is supported by £ 16 billion in private investment . &quot;
the London Games of 2012 were a great success for GB and I am confident that He@@ a@@ throw &apos;s expansion will also be one .
it is time for us to direct this Olympic spirit and expand He@@ a@@ throw as well as to secure our future trade and create a legacy of skills and employment that England can be proud of .

&quot; Ad@@ block Plus , Facebook in the &quot; &quot; K@@ atz and mouse game &quot; &quot; regarding ad blocking &quot;
&quot; for companies that earn money with online advertising , according to one of the software manufacturers attempts to b@@ ypass the ad block@@ age , equal to a &quot; &quot; cat and mouse game &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , only two days after Facebook announced that it would block displays on its desktop , Ad@@ block Plus released a blo@@ g@@ post in which users could update their filters in the program to once again block advertising on the social network . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that his desktop site would change the coding on its advertisements to make it more difficult to detect which part of the page advertising is advertising . &quot;
but Ad@@ block announced that it has found a new way to b@@ ypass new codes .
&quot; in a blog post , Ad@@ block Ben Williams wrote that &quot; this kind of h@@ in @-@ and @-@ fr@@ o @-@ fr@@ inge has been underway between the announ@@ cing Open Source Community and the b@@ outs since the invention of display lock@@ ers , &quot; and that it is possible that Facebook will soon come with a new solution . &quot;
the fact that the world &apos;s largest social media company has entered the battle is a strong indication of how wor@@ rying display lock@@ ers have become the industry .
&quot; according to a study published last year by Pa@@ gef@@ air and Adobe , some 200 million people use display lock@@ ers worldwide ; almost four times as much as 2013 . &quot;
&quot; with 1.@@ 03 billion daily active users accessing Facebook about their mobile devices , mobile advertising accounts for 84 percent of Facebook &apos;s advertising revenue . &quot;
&quot; the company has been targeting ad block@@ ers on desktop PCs , since mobile ad block@@ ers have no effect on Facebook &apos;s mobile app for the social network and Inst@@ agra@@ m , shared a spokes@@ man . &quot;
advertisement on desktop PCs makes a large share of the revenue generated so that Facebook appears to be worth the investment of such a step .
&quot; on Tuesday , Facebook announced that it would update its &quot; &quot; ad preferences tool &quot; &quot; to give people more control over advertising . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday , Facebook claimed that Ad@@ block would be wor@@ rying about new filters because they would also block content on the site that are not advertising . &quot;
&quot; for the users , this is not a positive experience , so we plan to address the problem , &quot; &quot; said a Facebook spokes@@ man in an email message . &quot;
&quot; ad block@@ ers are a silent means , which is why we focused on developing tools such as Ad Pre@@ ferences in order to put more control into the hands of the people . &quot;
woman with presum@@ ed suicide on Swiss highway crossing
the victim was in the middle of the night on the highway .
&quot; the police are calling for witnesses , after a woman was transferred to a highway in the early morning hours on Thursday in the case of a presum@@ ed suicide of several vehicles . &quot;
the incident happened on the A1 near Morges in the canton of Vau@@ d just after midnight .
&quot; a woman lay in the dark &quot; &quot; in an act of desper@@ ation &quot; &quot; on the street and were hit by several cars , the police said in Vau@@ d . &quot;
&quot; it is obvious that a Swiss at the age of 49 , who was over@@ driven by several vehicles , including a truck , wanted to kill himself . &quot;
she died still on site .
&quot; several drivers have already been heard , but some have not yet been identified , the police , who , as well as every witness of the incident , asked him to report . &quot;
&quot; an investig@@ ative trial opened , which is a &quot; logical &quot; step in such a situation , G@@ illes Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter shared with Le Tri@@ b@@ une de Gen@@ eve . &quot;
&quot; however , it remains to be seen whether one of the drivers will be shown . &quot;
was a clas@@ h avoid@@ able ?
&quot; this is something the prosec@@ utor must decide , &quot; said Hof@@ st@@ et@@ ter . &quot;
two similar cases over the last five years show that drivers will not be held ac@@ countable .
&quot; in each of the two cases where a person ran in the dark on the highway , it was decided that drivers do not have to assume that a pedestrian prec@@ e@@ des in the middle of the night on the highway , as it was called in the newspaper . &quot;
&quot; last year , a polic@@ ew@@ oman was acqu@@ itted of the neg@@ ligent killing after she had passed and killed a man who was lying on the A1 in August 2014 near Pay@@ erne . &quot;
the 22 @-@ year @-@ old victim had drunk and has become unconscious in the street .
&quot; the court found that the police officer -- who had responded to an emergency call -- drove to a justified manner and that the presence of a man on the road was a &quot; completely unusual and unfor@@ es@@ eeable situation , &quot; the judge said . &quot;
anyone who has more information on the incident on Thursday near Morges should report to the police under number 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 83 46 or 0@@ 21 6@@ 44 44 44 .
NASA climate model : Venus was once hab@@ itable
&quot; according to the projections of a new NASA climate model , Venus was probably inhabited once . &quot;
scientists at the Go@@ dd@@ ard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists .
&quot; the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have had similar conditions , with its hot , water@@ less surface and CO2 @-@ dense atmosphere . &quot;
scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere .
&quot; but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin , er@@ d@@ like atmosphere and yet turned slowly . &quot;
the model also illuminated the top@@ ography of the early Venus .
&quot; the planet probably indicated more dry areas than earth , but once had enough water and geographic vari@@ ability to accommodate life and protected from fast evap@@ oration . &quot;
the early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker .
&quot; in the G@@ ISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus has exposed its day side of the sun for almost two months , &quot; explained G@@ ISS scientist Anthony Del Gen@@ io in a press release . &quot;
&quot; this war@@ ms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds , which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat . &quot;
the result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today .
the model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously thought by planet researchers .
&quot; although it was once believed to be hab@@ itable , Venus -- in the course of several billions years --@@ has been exposed to too much heat and ultra@@ violet light . &quot;
their oceans evap@@ or@@ ated and their water vap@@ or was burnt away from ultra@@ violet light .
&quot; as their hydro@@ gene , only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide escaped with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus , which as we know it today . &quot;
the researchers shared the results of their new Venus climate model in Ge@@ ophysi@@ cal Research Let@@ ters .
Patrick Roy coming back as a trainer of the Aval@@ an@@ che
Patrick Roy came back on Thursday as a coach and Vice President of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che and led to a lower right of co @-@ determination in the decision @-@ making process of the team .
alternatively President / General Manager of the Color@@ ados Joe Sak@@ ic confirmed this decision and noticed that the association is immediately looking for a new trainer .
&quot; over the past three years , I have fulfilled my duties as head coach and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations of the Colorado Aval@@ an@@ che with energy , passion and determination . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the summer , I thought about how I could improve this team to give him more depth , needed it and bring it to a higher level . &quot;
&quot; in order to achieve this , the trainer and vice president of Ho@@ ckey Operations must be perfectly matched to that of the organization . &quot;
he also has to have a right of co @-@ determination in decisions that influence the performance of the team .
these conditions are not met at the moment .
&quot; Sak@@ ic , who had hired Roy on 23 May 2013 , thank@@ ed him for his contributions to the team . &quot;
&quot; Patrick was informed today about this decision , &quot; &quot; said Sak@@ ic . &quot;
we all appreciate what he has done for our organization and wish him only the best for the future .
Roy was awarded as the best trainer of the league during his debut season at the Aval@@ an@@ ches 2013 @-@ 14 as the winner of the Jack Adams Awards .
&quot; he led the club to 112 points and first place in Central Vision , but Colorado was defeated in the first round of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Pla@@ yo@@ ffs and missed the season in each of the last two years . &quot;
the Aval@@ an@@ ches recorded a 39 @-@ 39 @-@ 4 mark in the 2015 @-@ 16 season and fell short of the game for a second wild@@ card spot at the Western Conference by five points .
&quot; as Hall of F@@ ame Tor@@ wart , Roy won four Stan@@ ley C@@ ups -- two tracks with the Montreal @-@ Canadi@@ ans and the Aval@@ an@@ che . &quot;
&quot; Nor@@ th@@ ee@@ pers resume talks , put on strike &quot;
&quot; the labour struggles regarding the remuneration for North Sea oil workers are suspended , while all the parties for a new round of talks sit at the table , said negoti@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; strikes against the Oil Field Service Wood Group were spor@@ adi@@ cally carried out on platforms in the North Sea , operated by Royal Dutch Shell . &quot;
&quot; wood Group as well as the Un@@ ite and R@@ MT unions can confirm that we have agreed to restart the resolution process of the present strike , &quot; &quot; it says in a common statement . &quot;
we will pause some full @-@ day sessions over the next few weeks that will start at the beginning of next year to restart the problems .
&quot; the unions said that their last strike , which is the first in over 25 years , is a protest against possible cuts of wages of up to 30 percent . &quot;
&quot; this year , the Wood Group has cut rates to its contractors in the North Sea by around 9 percent due to negative market pressure . &quot;
the company &apos;s rate reduction follows a 10 % drop in on@@ shore contractors in 2014 .
the company said that additional cuts give the company the required space to get through the market down@@ turn .
&quot; Shell has released thousands of people and plans to abandon its oil and gas operations in up to 10 countries , as it stream@@ lined its business activities as a result of its mega @-@ merger with the British energy company BG Group . &quot;
&quot; energy companies are under pressure on the basis of lower crude oil prices , an economic situation which was reinforced by the British decision in June to leave the European Union . &quot;
the Scottish Parliament member Dave Anderson met with workers &quot; leaders at the beginning of this week to discuss one of the biggest work disputes that took place since a generation in the North Sea .
&quot; the North Sea is important for the regional economy , he said . &quot;
&quot; in the North Sea and throughout the country , we need an economy that works for many and not only for a few , &quot; he said in a statement . &quot;
&quot; in 2016 , less than $ 1.4 billion is expected for new projects in the North Sea in comparison to an average of around $ 7 billion in the past five years . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of stars in the stars of the P@@ lei@@ ades
the latest mission with the Ke@@ pler Space Teles@@ cope has helped astronom@@ ers to collect the most complete catalogue of rot@@ ational rates among the stars of the star cluster of the P@@ lei@@ ades .
the new data help astronom@@ ers understand why stars revol@@ ve at different rates in the Stern@@ enh@@ aufen and in what context the rotation @-@ time periods are associated with planetary emergence .
&quot; we hope that by comparing our results with other stars , we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star , its age and even the history of its solar system , &quot; said Lu@@ isa Reb@@ ull , a researcher at Cal@@ tech &apos;s Infr@@ ared Processing and Analysis Center in Pas@@ ad@@ ena , in a press release . &quot;
the star @-@ hat of the P@@ lei@@ ades lies 4@@ 45 light @-@ years distant from the Earth .
&quot; many stars in this star cluster , which originated approximately 125 million years ago , now reach adul@@ th@@ ood . &quot;
they are now the fastest .
at peak rot@@ ational rates these po@@ ison@@ ous stars encounter large quantities of star@@ ches .
&quot; as these winds travel through the stars of the stars , they have a braking effect on the stars . &quot;
&quot; when a star is aging , its rotation rate begins to slow down . &quot;
Ke@@ pler measures the rotation rate of each star by recognizing the time between the appearance of a recognizable star spot -- like sun spots -- .
the latest catalogue of rot@@ ational rates indicates that more massive stars are turning slower than less massive stars .
&quot; Reb@@ ull is comparing the stars with dancers , with larger stars directing slower pi@@ rou@@ ettes than smaller ones . &quot;
&quot; in the &quot; Ballet &quot; of the P@@ lei@@ ades we see that slow rot@@ ors tend to be massive , whereas faster rot@@ ors tend to be very bright stars , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; since the star @-@ pile of the P@@ lei@@ ades is so close , it serves as an ideal cosmic laboratory to compare stell@@ ar qualities such as rot@@ ational rates . &quot;
&quot; the star hat of the P@@ lei@@ ades offers an anchor for theoretical models of stell@@ ar rotation in both directions , younger and older , &quot; said Reb@@ ull . &quot;
&quot; there is still a lot ahead of us what we would like to learn more about how , when and why stars are slow@@ ing down their rotation rates and so to speak , their &quot; dance shoes . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in three newspaper reports , Reb@@ ull and her colleagues reported in detail about their latest analysis of the P@@ lei@@ ades Rot@@ ational rates that will soon be published in the Astronom@@ ical Journal . &quot;
a controversial Bas@@ eball @-@ Star ki@@ cks off
the tears ran faster with Alex Rodri@@ gu@@ ez as the US bas@@ eball star in the best days from Base to Base .
&quot; after his emotion@@ ally res@@ ignation announcement , the 41 year old professional will be wearing the jer@@ sey of his New York Yan@@ ke@@ es last time on August 12 against T@@ amp@@ a Bay Ra@@ ys . &quot;
&quot; I love this game and this team . &quot;
&quot; I say &quot; &quot; Goo@@ db@@ ye &quot; , &quot; declared the 14 @-@ time all @-@ star game participant of the Major League Bas@@ eball ( ML@@ B ) . &quot;
&quot; three times , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez was voted the most valuable player in the league , in 2009 he won the World Series with the Yan@@ ke@@ es . &quot;
his signature under a ten @-@ year contract has given him $ 27 million a year since 2007 .
&quot; until the end of the contract on 31 December 2017 , he will serve as a consultant and youth coach in the future - with full salary . &quot;
as a player it paid Rodri@@ gu@@ ez for a long time with performance .
&quot; with 6@@ 96 Hom@@ er@@ us , 3@@ 114 hits and 2021 points for his teams ( &quot; R@@ uns &quot; ) for the Seattle Marine ( 1994 to 2000 ) , the Texas R@@ angers ( 2001 to 2004 ) and since 2005 the Yan@@ ke@@ es he managed to mil@@ estones . &quot;
&quot; with the Hall @-@ of @-@ F@@ ame members H@@ ank Aaron and Wil@@ lie Ma@@ ys , only two other bas@@ eball players compete in the most important statistics . &quot;
&quot; however , the 41 year @-@ old should not be admitted to the rest hall of the Bas@@ eball . &quot;
because as successful Rodri@@ gu@@ ez - nick@@ name &quot; A @-@ R@@ od &quot; - was in the field so controversial is his appearance outside of the place .
&quot; as early as 2009 , the super@@ star appeared on &quot; ES@@ PN , &quot; between 2001 and 2003 , to have taken prohibited ster@@ oids . &quot;
&quot; in August 2013 , he was locked for 2@@ 11 games by the end of 2014 due to a winding in the so @-@ called Bio@@ genesis sc@@ andal . &quot;
Rodri@@ gu@@ ez is considered to be the main suspect for years to have received high @-@ performance funding via an anti @-@ aging clinic in South Florida .
&quot; after a dispute , the lock was reduced to 162 meetings . &quot;
&quot; the League could even have done me a favour for 2014 , because I played for 20 years without a break , &quot; &quot; Rodri@@ gu@@ ez then said sweet@@ ly . &quot;
also his farewell @-@ days are not no@@ is@@ eless .
&quot; while many bas@@ eball legends have once again received the big stage in their final games , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez often had to sit on the bench . &quot;
&quot; my job does not include a farewell tour . &quot;
&quot; my job ent@@ ails trying to win any game , &quot; says Yan@@ ke@@ es @-@ Coach Joe Gir@@ ar@@ di . &quot;
&quot; after all , Rodri@@ gu@@ ez , who was married to the act@@ ress Cameron Di@@ az and told her relations with Pop star Madonna and act@@ ress Kate Hudson , received sympathy from the fans of Yan@@ ke@@ e @-@ Erz@@ riv@@ alen Boston Red So@@ x . &quot;
&quot; we want A @-@ R@@ od , &quot; sung the supporters at the 4 : 9 defeat against the Rodri@@ gu@@ ez team . &quot;
&quot; Olympics 2016 : little X@@ in@@ yi , Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ ova and Adrian Ziel@@ inski are the first dop@@ ing cases &quot;
&quot; caught : because of a positive dop@@ ing sample , weight lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski from Poland in Rio cannot start . &quot;
Rio de Janeiro - The 2016 Olympic Games will be over@@ shad@@ owed by the first official dop@@ ing cases .
an educated ath@@ lete had won almost a medal .
&quot; before the seventh competition day , the first official dop@@ ing events in Rio de Janeiro are known . &quot;
&quot; the Chinese float in Ch@@ en X@@ in@@ yi , 3000 @-@ metre obstacle @-@ runner Sil@@ wi@@ a Dan@@ ek@@ owa from Bulgaria and the Polish wei@@ ght@@ lif@@ ter Adrian Ziel@@ inski were positively tested and excluded in Brazil - immediately before the start of the already critical athle@@ tics competitions this news comes to the unknown . &quot;
&quot; in Ch@@ en , last Sunday the di@@ ure@@ tic hydro@@ chlor@@ ot@@ hi@@ azi@@ de was detected , which is used as a mas@@ ked agent for dop@@ ing substances . &quot;
&quot; on Friday afternoon , the International Sports Court ( CA@@ S ) confirmed their expul@@ sion from the Olympic Games . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday , the 18 @-@ year @-@ old occupied the fourth place in the final over 100 m of butter@@ flies , only by 0.@@ 09 seconds she missed the bronze medal . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , Ch@@ en should have participated in the courses above 50 m of fre@@ estyle . &quot;
&quot; at the International Olympic Committee ( IO@@ C ) , the opening of the B @-@ Trial Chamber and a hearing was requested . &quot;
&quot; the national association takes the matter very seriously and demands full cooperation in the investigations , &quot; &quot; said X@@ in@@ hua from a message : &quot; &quot; we will cooperate with the International Sports Court CA@@ S and will accept the verdict . &quot;
&quot; for the first time in history , the IO@@ C is no longer responsible for the san@@ ction of athletes with positive cases . &quot;
&quot; also during the night of Rio , the news se@@ ep across the positive sample at Dan@@ ek@@ owa , the 33 @-@ year @-@ old went on to the offensive . &quot;
&quot; I had three tests , all negative , and my fourth review was positive , &quot; said the Bulgarian TV station B@@ NT . &quot;
&quot; it is innocent , &quot; the only explanation could be dietary supplements , &quot; the ath@@ lete explained . &quot;
&quot; according to the report , there should be a forbidden substance in the EP@@ O blood dop@@ ing agent . &quot;
&quot; Dan@@ ek@@ owa was temporarily suspended , according to B@@ NT , the B @-@ Trial should also have been positive . &quot;
Bulgaria &apos;s Prime Minister Bo@@ y@@ ko Bor@@ is@@ so@@ v immediately reported to his criticism of the ath@@ lete .
&quot; I don &apos;t understand why the athletes don &apos;t draw the right conclusions , &quot; he said : &quot; we Bulg@@ arians are under observation , so many have already been excluded . &quot;
&quot; for example , all important weight lif@@ ters from the chron@@ ically dop@@ ing nation may not participate in Rio . &quot;
&quot; on Friday , the case &quot; &quot; Adrian Ziel@@ inski &quot; &quot; was also known , the London Olympic champion in the class up to 85 kg was tested as Tom@@ as@@ z three days before on the an@@ abolic ster@@ oid N@@ and@@ ro@@ lon . &quot;
&quot; both are best for taking , but both must not start in the class up to 94 kg . &quot;
&quot; before the start of the athletes , especially the Dan@@ ek@@ ova case is another heavy blow for the reputation of the whole sport . &quot;
&quot; the World Federation IA@@ AF had forbidden the entire Russian team up to an exception for systematic dop@@ ing , but also the L@@ äu@@ er@@ nation Kenya produces numerous bad news in Rio . &quot;
&quot; in swimming sport , the previous ver@@ ges in China also caused violent clas@@ hes between the athletes . &quot;
thus the Fren@@ ch@@ man Cam@@ ille Lac@@ our@@ t attacked the Chinese Olympic champion Sun Y@@ ang har@@ sch .
&quot; sun Y@@ ang p@@ ink@@ elt li@@ la , &quot;
&quot; when I see the podium over 200 m of fre@@ estyle , I want to hand over , &quot; &quot; said Lac@@ our@@ t in the French radio . &quot;
sun was also at the heart of a confrontation with the Australian M@@ ack H@@ ort@@ on .
&quot; I have no time and no respect for dop@@ ing fraud , &quot; &quot; said this . &quot;
&quot; sun had been positively tested by the Chinese champi@@ onships in 2014 , but had only had to shut down a three month block@@ ade . &quot;
&quot; Dat@@ enk@@ lau : so per@@ fi@@ de , h@@ ack@@ ers black@@ mail their ran@@ som &quot;
programmers of black@@ mail @-@ malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so .
&quot; according to a recent survey of malware def@@ enses specialists mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes under 5@@ 40 companies in North America , Great Britain and Germany , 40 percent of the sur@@ vey@@ ed companies in the past twelve months have at least once , sometimes several times victims of an attack with black@@ mail software . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of Ran@@ som@@ ware black@@ mail . &quot;
40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ran@@ som paid by the perpetr@@ ators to recover the attacked systems and data .
the perpetr@@ ators speci@@ alize their black@@ mail software according to the observations of Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes explicitly on attacks in company networks .
&quot; if they are successful there , the potential to save money is significantly higher than with private users . &quot;
&quot; we are currently watching a terri@@ fying rapid evolution of the malware , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski in conversation with the &quot; world . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in 2008 , most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising . &quot;
then the perpetr@@ ators discovered black@@ mail software for themselves .
&quot; only private users were the target , but the change to company attacks took place in recent months . &quot;
&quot; Ran@@ som@@ ware works on a simple pattern : once active on the victim &apos;s computer , it searches for recently changed files such as Word@@ - , Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos . &quot;
these files encryp@@ t the ran@@ som@@ ware and er@@ ase the origin@@ als last@@ ingly .
&quot; subsequently , the software presents the demands of the black@@ mail . &quot;
&quot; in order to get the encryption code to the files , the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cr@@ yp@@ to@@ gen Bit@@ coin . &quot;
&quot; however , where private users use the personal photo database on the game , companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is shut down . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , the damage is higher when a ran@@ som@@ ware strikes . &quot;
&quot; 22 percent of German companies reported sales losses through Ran@@ som@@ ware , 13 percent even had to completely inter@@ rupt business operation , in one case people were in danger of life . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , several hospitals have already been victims of attacks , whose patients can be ac@@ utely threatened by the loss of medical records . &quot;
&quot; we always say to the victims , &quot; &quot; Don &apos;t pay , you only support the problem , &quot; &quot; explains K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; however , 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay will get their data back . &quot;
&quot; in view of stand@@ still in operation , it is difficult for managers to reject the demand of the perpetr@@ ators . &quot;
the h@@ ack@@ ers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation .
&quot; in a recent study , the safety researchers of F @-@ Secure analyzed the user interfaces and contact with black@@ mail and come to the conclusion : the perpetr@@ ators actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money . &quot;
&quot; they explain to their victims via chat , how they can pay per Bit@@ coin , set up freely available support websites or de@@ cryp@@ t for example files . &quot;
&quot; and if private individuals are redeemed after payments of only a few hundred euros , companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five @-@ digit sums in order to get their data un@@ encrypted . &quot;
&quot; given the potentially high and relatively low risk profits from the ran@@ som@@ ware @-@ black@@ mail , h@@ ack@@ ers become more and more professional and share their work , explains safety expert Ch@@ ester Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski from the anti @-@ virus provider SO@@ PH@@ OS : &quot; a single person can write a ran@@ som@@ ware approximately within a week . &quot;
&quot; however , it is more likely that these are three or four persons . &quot;
the programmers sell their malicious software in the form of a software modular system to the actual black@@ mail .
&quot; the previous malware kits were created by buying malware itself , consulting and additional tools for a unique , fixed price between 1000 and $ 10,000 . &quot;
&quot; the scope of delivery includes an adjustment tool , so that smaller configurations , appearance and br@@ anding can be changed , &quot; says Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the black@@ mail is then looking for more h@@ ack@@ ers to spread the freshly purchased software under the victims .
we live in a service economy .
&quot; so one logs in one of the forums in the underground , bu@@ ys the set from a criminal and instruc@@ ts another to install the software on as many PCs as possible . &quot;
the payment is made per infected machine .
&quot; usually the criminals employ sp@@ amm@@ ers with spreading , &quot; explains Wis@@ ni@@ ew@@ ski . &quot;
the risk of ran@@ som@@ ware is now known by many companies that better safeguard their data .
over 50 percent of companies @-@ IT managers in the Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes survey have confidence in defending Ran@@ som@@ ware by means of file back @-@ ups and scanner software .
&quot; accordingly , the perpetr@@ ators are already pursuing new strategies . &quot;
&quot; if the encryption of data alone is not a sufficient threat to successful measurement , the perpetr@@ ators thre@@ aten instead with the publication of sensitive data such as customer lists or price calculations , &quot; explains Mal@@ war@@ eb@@ ytes chef Mar@@ cin K@@ lec@@ zy@@ n@@ ski . &quot;
&quot; this means that the potential for damage , depending on the type of data , is much higher than before . &quot;
&quot; in future , the perpetr@@ ators could also take entirely new targets on the internet of things in the internet of things . &quot;
&quot; at the &quot; &quot; Hack@@ er@@ konferenz &quot; &quot; de@@ con , security researchers demonstrated how they could get a thermo@@ stat connected to the internet under their control . &quot;
&quot; in the middle of the winter , the activation of such a blocked heating could certainly be worth a ran@@ som . &quot;
&quot; if the perpetr@@ ators then block a whole production line in a factory instead of the heating in the future , Ran@@ som@@ ware could also become an issue in Industry 4.0 . &quot;
one for all cases
Honda HR @-@ V is flexible and suitable for everyday use
&quot; in the small HR @-@ V Honda will pack everything : a little SUV , a little coup@@ é and even the versatility of a mini@@ van . &quot;
&quot; sounds rather over@@ loaded , but the HR @-@ V , which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz , proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life . &quot;
&quot; although the only 1.@@ 60 m high HR @-@ V is rather small , the passengers have plenty of space in both the first and rear seats , it does not work in any place . &quot;
&quot; the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect , only the cockpit @-@ top acc@@ ru@@ es something . &quot;
the HR @-@ V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage room .
&quot; there is not only a trunk of 4@@ 53 l for high @-@ rise and 10@@ 26 l with revers@@ ed back rests , but there is the &quot; &quot; Magic Se@@ ats &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; this is less magical than it sounds : the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like Kin@@ os@@ ound and thus offer storage space , which is up to 1.@@ 24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling . &quot;
&quot; the trunk can be loaded very well , but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008 . &quot;
the tested 1.6 @-@ liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp acceler@@ ates the HR @-@ V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges .
&quot; he should , however , perform his work a bit qui@@ eter . &quot;
the daily consumption of 4.@@ 7 l / 100 km is encouraging .
there is another engine type : a 1.5 @-@ liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp .
a four @-@ wheel drive is not offered .
&quot; the driving behavior is balanced , a good compromise between dynamics and comfort . &quot;
but the steering should be a bit more direct .
&quot; in the tested top variant &quot; &quot; Executive &quot; &quot; the equipment leaves nothing to be desired . &quot;
&quot; the security systems include the City emergency braking assistant ( working at speeds 32 ) , the collision warning system and the track maintenance assistant . &quot;
the collision warning sometimes irrit@@ ates because he ass@@ esses many obstacles as &quot; approaching objects &quot; when manoeu@@ v@@ ring .
the high @-@ beam assistant works very reliably .
and the intelligent temperature controller re@@ acts to the road sign detection and re@@ acts speed if required .
&quot; however , the full connectivity is only available for the top features : 7 @-@ inch touch@@ screen , navigation device , app integration and more . &quot;
two USB and one HDMI connector are under the arm@@ rest and are therefore slightly cum@@ ber@@ some .
&quot; the approximately 29@@ ,000 euros for the well @-@ equipped top dies@@ els are fine . &quot;
&quot; those who don &apos;t want to invest so much will receive petrol from 200@@ 00 Euro , the diesel from 2@@ 3000 euros . &quot;
the engines comply with the Euro 6 emission standard .
&quot; with the HR @-@ V , Honda offers a versatile and everyday car . &quot;
Air@@ line is not liable : fall on passenger jet@@ ty
an airline is not responsible for the fall of a passenger on the passenger jet@@ ty .
&quot; the Ober@@ landes@@ gericht Düsseldorf ( A@@ z . : 18 U 124 / 14 ) argued for a liability only if possible , which are typical for aviation . &quot;
the pla@@ inti@@ ff had broken a knee in the fall .
&quot; however , the accident would have been able to happen everywhere - it was a general risk of life , such as the court . &quot;
the airline had to pay no compensation for the man .
case of illness : when does the organizer pay
&quot; after their trip , sick holiday@@ makers only get money back when the cause of the disease can be found without doubt in the hotel . &quot;
&quot; however , this is only the case when more than ten percent of the guests have proven to show the same symptoms . &quot;
&quot; in the negotiated case , on the second day of its entry , a family was severely ill from diar@@ rhe@@ a and vom@@ iting . &quot;
she spent almost the entire vacation in the room .
their disease caused the tourists to return to a defective wastewater treatment plant that allegedly poll@@ uted sea@@ water .
the family felt that the trip had been poor - and compla@@ ined against the organis@@ er .
the pla@@ inti@@ ffs had no success before the court .
&quot; indeed , the sewage treatment plant was defective . &quot;
but the organis@@ er only learned about it shortly before departure of the pla@@ inti@@ ffs .
until then he had to assume that sea@@ water was fine .
&quot; he did not violate his duties of information , so the judgment . &quot;
&quot; especially as in the samples of the water , no contam@@ in@@ ants were found . &quot;
the disease of several hotel guests - possibly by con@@ ta@@ gion among themselves - belongs to the general risk of life .
only 38 of the 6@@ 91 guests were ill .
&quot; said Ms Mai@@ zi@@ ère , after the violent acts committed by refugees in Würzburg and Ans@@ bach in July , many people were worried about further attacks . &quot;
the state must be so@@ ber and decided at the same time to react to terrorism .
&quot; surely , our country will not answer the violence of the perpetr@@ ators with hate and division . &quot;
we will not allow this triumph to terrorists .
&quot; if off@@ ences have to leave the country faster , however , the security and strength also increase the consent of the population for refugee policy . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère wants to achieve the implementation of the proposals by the 2017 Bundestag election .
&quot; he also announced further personnel strengthening of the security forces , &quot; &quot; in a medium @-@ four scale order over several years . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the promotion of sympath@@ iz@@ ations for terrorism must be pun@@ ishable again .
&quot; video surveillance should be improved , the law of tru@@ ce will be amended to make it more difficult to purchase weapons on the Internet . &quot;
the last much discussed duty of silence for doctors is to be maintained in accordance with de Mai@@ zi@@ ères &apos;s words .
&quot; however , in dialogue with the medical profession , he wants to look for solutions as to how the threat of the citizens can be reduced , he said with a look at psych@@ ic ab@@ norm@@ alities . &quot;
&quot; in order to counter@@ act the radic@@ alisation of refugees , the minister considers a better social support necessary . &quot;
teachers should better be prepared for dealing with traumati@@ zed people .
&quot; in order to prosec@@ ute criminals in special areas of the Internet ( Dark@@ net ) , de Mai@@ zi@@ ère is planning to use hidden investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; SPD leader Gabriel said : &quot; &quot; the SPD is ready to talk about everything , which contributes to further enhancing safety . &quot;
it is important that the Minister of the Interior had clearly expressed themselves against action .
&quot; that was a sla@@ p for the Schar@@ f@@ macher in the CD@@ U / CS@@ U , &quot; Gabriel said the newspapers of the Fun@@ ke media group ( Friday ) . &quot;
de Mai@@ zi@@ ère had previously rejected calls from the Union after a bur@@ ka ban and the abolition of dual citizenship .
&quot; as a general prohibition of full @-@ wear , it is constitu@@ tionally problematic . &quot;
&quot; you can &apos;t ban anything you refuse , and I reject the wearing of the bur@@ q@@ a . &quot;
one can talk about rules about traffic or for witnesses in court .
&quot; green boss Simone Peter designed the minister , he wanted to simulate with ever new anti @-@ terror par@@ c@@ els of action and ability to act . &quot;
&quot; left @-@ party leader Bernd Ri@@ ex@@ inger said : &quot; &quot; fleet Pro@@ verb@@ s and a tigh@@ tening of the right to stay bring people no longer safe in this country . &quot;
better traffic flow at the motorway feeder
it st@@ alls regularly on the b@@ ypass road - here is a picture of November .
&quot; however , this should change : the legal regulation is to be extended . &quot;
&quot; this is good news for all car drivers , who are in traffic on the surrounding road every evening in traffic jams when they drive over the motorway to the feeder ( A 43 ) . &quot;
&quot; on the next Tuesday and Wednesday ( 16 / 17 August ) , the state @-@ run road construction extends the road between Hammer Street and the De@@ par@@ ture Wes@@ eler Straße by 700 meters . &quot;
drivers can then go right from the hammer road to the right .
&quot; the big advantage : the traffic con@@ veys at an early stage , whereby the total over@@ flow is improved on the busy section of the federal highway 51 . &quot;
&quot; the idea , with the extended exit , had the CD@@ U Group in the district of Min@@ ster @-@ West . &quot;
&quot; the road nar@@ rowing on the feeder anno@@ ys drivers , above all , between 17 and 19 o &apos;clock . &quot;
&quot; on week@@ days , the back@@ stage reaches the bridge over the Alber@@ go path and sometimes even beyond . &quot;
reason is the con@@ i@@ fer on the B 51 shortly before Wes@@ eler Straße .
&quot; from here , traffic is only chann@@ elled into one lane via the motorway bridge . &quot;
the second track had to be traced back to a good three @-@ quarter years ago .
&quot; the reason : static calculations had shown that the bridge no longer has the necessary load capacity , in order to absorb the heavy @-@ load traffic in particular . &quot;
&quot; how long this bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck and the connected daily traffic jam will continue , the local authorities cannot say . &quot;
&quot; however , years must be expected : because the bridge has an official residual service life until 20@@ 34 . &quot;
&quot; for the extension of the legal regulation , the state of the country deliberately chose the traffic @-@ weaker period in the school holidays because it was to be expected with disabilities . &quot;
the traffic is managed on Tuesday and Wednesday at the construction site .
cross @-@ cultural journey : cultural offerings for schools
&quot; the international class of the forest school visited the play &quot; &quot; Das Un@@ seen Haus &quot; . &quot; &quot;
the association N@@ ima &apos;s and the Junge Theater are planning a music project .
the association N@@ ima &apos;s enables young people with a migration and refugee background to visit cultural institutions in Münster .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; Class International &quot; &quot; of the Wald@@ schule Children &apos;s House has visited a presentation of the award @-@ winning piece &quot; The invisible house &quot; of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; in the context of the &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; initiated by the association N@@ ima &apos;s &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey , &quot; 19 pupils between eleven and 15 years visited the production in the little house . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the association , which aims to promote the cultural integration of young people with a migration and refugee background , has the opportunity to visit cultural institutions in Münster as part of this project . &quot;
&quot; most of the young people in the class were between September 2015 and March 2016 , among others , from Afghanistan , Iran , Serbia and Syria to Münster , speaking little German . &quot;
&quot; thanks to the chore@@ ographies , the scenic pictures and video animations it was possible for them to follow the course of action nevertheless , the press release of the Junge Theater Münster . &quot;
&quot; the association N@@ ima &apos;s , founded by Dr. Tann@@ az West@@ er@@ berg from spra@@ y@@ ling , and the young theatre will work together in the upcoming season as part of a music theatre project . &quot;
&quot; from October to December , teenagers with and without escape and migration background should be given the opportunity to attend professionally guided courses in the fields of singing , dance , acting and music . &quot;
offers for children and families in the area of theatre play and theatrical language mediation are in the planning stage .
the project &quot; Inter@@ cultural Journey &quot; continues .
&quot; in view of the increased number of refugees , the association pays tribute to many classes who want to participate . &quot;
rain instead of shooting stars : hope for improvement
the weather has made the star schn@@ u@@ ppen @-@ gu@@ ck@@ ern in the south @-@ west of Germany on Friday a line through the invoice - but there is still hope .
&quot; the night was bad for clouds and rain to watch the cel@@ esti@@ al spectacle , said the Chairman of the Astronom@@ ical Observ@@ atory Wel@@ z@@ heim , Hans @-@ Ulrich Keller , Friday morning . &quot;
our hope is on the night to Saturday .
&quot; the weather should be good , then we see a lot of shooting stars in the sky . &quot;
&quot; with 2@@ 16@@ 000 kilometers per hour , the Z@@ odi@@ ac is one of the fastest shooting stars . &quot;
&quot; they have their name , because they seem to come from the con@@ stellation Per@@ se@@ us , which rises in the north @-@ east . &quot;
relaxing night : tips for sleeping disorders
&quot; in the evening , one walks around etern@@ ally , at night one is awake for hours , in the morning it is already far from the wake @-@ up ring no longer to think of sleep . &quot;
this is anything but relaxing .
&quot; after all , you are in good company with such problems : according to the Robert Koch Institute , about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing . &quot;
how do sleeping problems or sleep disorders manifest ?
&quot; there are several forms of sleep disorders , and there can be many reasons behind them , emphas@@ ised Hans @-@ Günter We@@ eß , member of the board of the German Society for Dec@@ or@@ ative Dec@@ eption and S@@ leep Medicine . &quot;
&quot; what one generally understands , however , is the In@@ som@@ nia , that is , a distur@@ b@@ ance and a distur@@ b@@ ance . &quot;
&quot; just through sleep many people feel uns@@ atis@@ factory or inadequate , says Jens Wagen@@ knecht , member of the board of the German house doctor association with practice in Var@@ el in Lower Saxony . &quot;
what is behind sleep disorders ?
the causes of sleep disorders are complex .
&quot; there can be organic , mental or behavi@@ our@@ al factors , but also medicines . &quot;
&quot; often , sleep distur@@ b@@ ance is an expression of another disorder . &quot;
&quot; very early awakening is mostly common in depression , &quot; says We@@ eß . &quot;
and it can be that different factors condition one another .
&quot; who , for example , has a her@@ ni@@ ated disc , can lie poorly , guards every two to three hours and may start to p@@ onder@@ ing about everyday problems and worries , there &apos;s an example . &quot;
&quot; this leads to tension , and sleep is no longer possible . &quot;
when should sleep disorders become a doctor ?
&quot; if you do not sleep well over a month in at least three nights a week and are com@@ promised the day , you should go to the doctor , advises We@@ eß . &quot;
&quot; the impair@@ ment can look very different : one is down@@ cast , tired , sleep@@ y , has difficulties with the attention and concentration , is easily irrit@@ able , has mood sw@@ ings or physical ail@@ ments like stomach or head@@ aches . &quot;
&quot; in order to allevi@@ ate the sleep distur@@ b@@ ance , it is important to find out their causes . &quot;
&quot; treatment options include behavi@@ our@@ al changes , cognitive behavi@@ our@@ al therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks . &quot;
&quot; Dr. In@@ go Fi@@ etze , head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical center of the Char@@ ité Universitäts@@ medizin Berlin , is hardly available in Germany . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one should first turn to the primary doctor in case of sleeping problems , advises We@@ eß . &quot;
this can be clari@@ fied by investigations whether the problems have a physical cause .
&quot; who should go to sleep , and what happens ? &quot;
&quot; for an examination in the sleep laboratory , physicians advise for example with snor@@ ing with breathing drop@@ outs , in case of disease @-@ related ti@@ redness , in case of sleep@@ wal@@ kers or if one does not find the cause of a distur@@ b@@ ance , explains Fi@@ etze . &quot;
it is not necessary to prepare for the examination .
you should spend the day normally .
&quot; only do not take a n@@ ap , &quot; says Fi@@ etz . &quot;
&quot; after the disgu@@ ise , one goes to bed at his normal time . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the electrodes on the body , one carries a nose @-@ go@@ g@@ gles , a chest strap and a fe@@ eler at the finger . &quot;
&quot; in addition , a camera records the sleeping end at the ceiling . &quot;
how can those affected get a grip on the problems ?
there are quite a lot of adjusting screws for better sleep .
&quot; We@@ aving counts on : regular sleeping and up@@ loading times , not too long in bed , do not sleep on the day , do not watch TV to sleep , do not avoid smoking and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to reck@@ on immediately , and that is absolutely not condu@@ ci@@ ve . &quot;
what the jungle camp with missing medals in swimming
the former German swi@@ mmer Markus Dei@@ bler has commented on Facebook for the dis@@ ap@@ pointing end of the DS@@ V team at Olymp@@ is .
&quot; in December 2014 , he held gold for the first time at the Kurz@@ Railway Championships in Doh@@ a and at the same time set up his first world record . &quot;
&quot; now , the former DS@@ V ath@@ lete Markus Dei@@ bler via fac@@ ebook placed himself in front of his ex @-@ team colleagues standing in the critic@@ isms . &quot;
&quot; in a country where an Olympic Champion gains $ 20,000 and a jungle king of 150@@ ,000 € no one should be surprised about missing medals , &quot; the 26 @-@ year @-@ old wrote during the night on his Facebook page . &quot;
&quot; the feeding system in swimming is bad , whereas dop@@ ing checks are very good . &quot;
&quot; with this , we cannot compete with countries that promote a lot and do not see exactly or even run it on the topic of dop@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t say that controls are to be set here , &quot; &quot; he explained . &quot;
&quot; if he wanted to make a com@@ eback , Dei@@ bler would have to be announced nine months before his first launch of the National Anti @-@ D@@ oping Agency ( NA@@ DA ) . &quot;
this is exactly how you should keep it with countries .
&quot; who cannot be controlled for a certain time before WM / OS by independent controllers of WA@@ DA / FIN@@ A must not take part , &quot; says the election @-@ ham@@ burger who meanwhile runs an ice cream . &quot;
airport : gang of luggage thi@@ eves arrested
professional thi@@ eves at the Düsseldorf Airport
&quot; on Thursday , civilian investig@@ ators of the Düsseldorf police were able to capture two women and two men aged between 50 and 61 years old . &quot;
the susp@@ ects had committed several hand@@ ker@@ chiefs and luggage ste@@ els as ban@@ dits .
&quot; at 21.@@ 30 , civilian officials in the Düsseldorf airport recognized a gang that was known to the polic@@ emen of past theft off@@ ences . &quot;
&quot; the two women and two men had committed several off@@ ences since the middle of July of this year and , in doing so , proc@@ eeded in a collective , labour @-@ oriented and particularly professional manner . &quot;
&quot; the specialists of the Criminal Police Office 34 can prove four acts to the thi@@ eves , which were specifically prescribed for crimes committed to Germany . &quot;
&quot; in total , they had a total of more than 15,000 euros . &quot;
&quot; old buildings , some lin@@ den trees , in between still a rest cob@@ ble@@ stone pav@@ ement : the Riga street in Berlin @-@ Friedrichsha@@ in doesn &apos;t look like at first sight , but the police are one of the &quot; &quot; dangerous places &quot; &quot; of the city . &quot;
&quot; walking along the road from east to west , one passes on play@@ grounds , a newly painted kinder@@ garten and a bi@@ ol@@ aden . &quot;
someone &quot; ug@@ ly ! &quot; jumped to the facade of a gray house .
&quot; in comparison to a Li@@ dl , which is also to be demol@@ ished soon , it is already being built : until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , articles about this &quot; &quot; trendy district &quot; , &quot; as the responsible real estate company Friedrichsha@@ in , are still favor@@ ed with burning cars . &quot;
&quot; the reason is the house with number 94 : once it was occupied , meanwhile the residents have occupied apartment contracts , but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of the year , the Berlin inner sen@@ ator Henkel has repeatedly called for a hard action by the police against the project , the area referred to as a &quot; no @-@ go zone &quot; for polic@@ emen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor , the Cad@@ ter@@ schmi@@ ede , with 300 police officers , pat@@ rol the police for three weeks , according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew wag@@ ons on site , locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94 . &quot;
&quot; meanwhile , construction workers commissioned the rooms on behalf of the unknown home@@ owners . &quot;
&quot; on 13 July , a Berlin administration court ruled that the clearance had been illegal and a day later police and construction workers abandoned the jubil@@ ation of sympath@@ iz@@ ers and residents . &quot;
&quot; on this summer afternoon the road is peaceful : parents walk with children , people sit on the pav@@ ement in front of the houses in the sun , others are enter@@ tained before late i . &quot;
in the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kinder@@ gar@@ tens .
&quot; left hand violence is not the main concern of many residents : Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been in the neighborhood since 1999 , and Jan@@ a * , who plays three children here , are mostly stressed by the police presence . &quot;
&quot; with the inhabitants of the house projects , they share the concern of rising r@@ ents and v@@ entri@@ fication . &quot;
it does not sound like a Kie@@ z who wished for several local police protection from the v@@ and@@ ali@@ atory left .
&quot; the tren@@ ch , which the Berlin inner sen@@ ator and the police set up between house occup@@ iers and their neighbors , obviously does not exist . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the rest of the city , Friedrichsha@@ in in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working @-@ class district . &quot;
&quot; house occup@@ ations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the neighbourhood : in 1990 , numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR , including nearly the entire Main@@ zer Strasse in the vicinity of the Riga . &quot;
&quot; while the Main@@ zer was evacu@@ ated under a large police force in a regular street battle , many of the projects were leg@@ alized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in recent years , the bor@@ ough has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and poll@@ ers from all over the world . &quot;
&quot; this is also reflected in the r@@ ents , which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009 . &quot;
&quot; many of the new@@ buildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development : they can be identified with wrapped slices or freshly painted fac@@ ades , which were thrown with color bags . &quot;
no other road was mentioned this year with the words &quot; left @-@ autonomous violence . &quot;
&quot; one reason for not seeing all of the neighbours as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime . according to statistics , criminal offen@@ ders like bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against polic@@ emen . &quot;
&quot; the majority of the off@@ ences make property damage , which tends to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses . &quot;
&quot; for Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer , who has been living in a ten@@ ancy house for 17 years next to the disputed 94 , uncertainty cannot be made of uncertainty . &quot;
&quot; as for violence , it is wei@@ ght@@ less : the people in the 94 are their neighbors , they were not intended . &quot;
even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Riga city anymore .
&quot; for the studied architecture , her road is not a criminal focus , on the contrary : &quot; here one helps one another , lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere . &quot;
Neu@@ geb@@ auer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained .
&quot; for this reason , it was also so important that the residents got their streets back : from the police , politics and the media , which suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty of the district in July . &quot;
&quot; however , in the eyes of residents such as Neu@@ geb@@ auer , the road continues to be taken away : by fac@@ eless new buildings in former buildings , which push the old inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; in the end , these are con@@ domini@@ ums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well cared for , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; I can absolutely not appro@@ ve violence and destruction . &quot;
but what should you do if you never listen to someone ?
&quot; there is fru@@ stration on all sides , including the police and the inhabitants . &quot;
&quot; for those who are anno@@ yed about color bombs , Ker@@ stin Neu@@ geb@@ auer has little understanding : the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood . &quot;
&quot; who draws , should be aware of it - just like someone who pul@@ ls into a tavern district , can complain badly about noise there . &quot;

Ur@@ bach : Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is a new refugee policy
Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le is the contact person in terms of integration and organizer .
she is also a social worker on site .
&quot; since July , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le has been the Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es for Ur@@ bach . &quot;
the social educ@@ ator supports the team of management for Ach@@ im Gro@@ cken@@ berger .
&quot; she sees herself as a contact partner for all actors : refugees , working group refugee aid , administration , authorities and anyone else . &quot;
&quot; Reg@@ ine customer of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deu@@ sch@@ le is now there , the ha@@ iling Woll@@ mil@@ k@@ sau , which above all has a problem . &quot;
&quot; in this way , some - less ridi@@ culous than rather focused on the multitude of desired tasks - meant , when the administration wanted to write the passage . &quot;
&quot; looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people , combined with a long @-@ standing experience in the field of social work , there was also an en@@ mes@@ h@@ ed wool mil@@ k@@ sau . &quot;
&quot; but administrative work is not her central area , Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le writes . &quot;
&quot; above all , it is about organisation , work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities . &quot;
the 31 @-@ year @-@ old has been there for about six weeks .
it has limited a 50 percent site to three years .
&quot; it was high time , &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer , that Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le supports honest and full @-@ time actors . &quot;
&quot; there are big and small problems , organizational , human and communication problems . &quot;
&quot; soon , new containers will be placed in the water@@ way &quot;
it has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting flights that have been recognized .
the municipalities are responsible for the connection provision .
they have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living spaces .
&quot; the cost of the construction , the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves . &quot;
the responsibility changes from the District Office to the Commune and Job@@ center .
&quot; problem : there are free objects , but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment . &quot;
the search has been very difficult for some time now .
&quot; de facto , administration does not find private apartments . &quot;
&quot; so far , it is not working , if one relies on private dwell@@ ings , so Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; therefore , community dwell@@ ings must be in@@ timi@@ dated as it is so beautiful . &quot;
new containers will soon be set up in the Was@@ en@@ straße .
but only with apartments it is not done .
&quot; perspective is the keyword , Reg@@ ine customer and Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le agree . &quot;
&quot; in addition to a permanent residence , there are internship plac@@ ements , training places , school grounds , one @-@ euro jobs and auxili@@ aries for refugees and migrants who have to be spotted or set up . &quot;
&quot; more places would be good , &quot; reports Reg@@ ine customer . &quot;
&quot; many work in the building yard or help house masters , do non @-@ profit work - and that motiv@@ ates and very ti@@ dy , as Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le reports . &quot;
it hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external impact .
&quot; this is &quot; &quot; no employment therapy &quot; . &quot; &quot;
but activity does not only mean work .
&quot; the day needs a solid structure , say Deu@@ sch@@ le and customer . &quot;
people would have to develop a sense of belonging .
&quot; so I need offers such as sports , contacts with locals and especially language courses . &quot;
professional courses are rare .
&quot; so , administration and honorary officials also jump here . &quot;
it is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany .
the long duration of the procedure is a problem .
&quot; they must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wis@@ ely , for example with language courses . &quot;
&quot; who at some point develop the feeling that he can no one help in Ur@@ bach , do not work and be un@@ profitable , he will never be integrated . &quot;
the clear majority is motivated .
&quot; the work of Deu@@ sch@@ le and the customer is , therefore , always to motiv@@ ate others . &quot;
all this is already a mam@@ mot@@ h task .
&quot; a difficult question : do the two have fear of radic@@ alisation after the recent events , even in a small church such as Ur@@ bach ? &quot;
&quot; no , &quot; Reg@@ ine customer says clearly , &quot; what some may call nai@@ ve . &quot; &quot;
but the hel@@ pers are already sensi@@ ti@@ zed .
these incidents are also subject to refugees .
they would have the fear that the assass@@ ins killed them completely .
&quot; they want to show that they have nothing to do with it , &quot; &quot; says Reg@@ ine Customer . &quot;
many would like to stay in Ur@@ bach .
so main and honorary officials have to look out for activities on the spot and in the region .
they always have in the background that soon there could be a new push to refugees and migrants to Ur@@ bach .
does Germany need a upper limit ?
&quot; to answer this question clearly , the policy elu@@ des itself . &quot;
&quot; in fact , it is unfair to put them on the spot . &quot;
&quot; in Ur@@ bach , we haven &apos;t arrived where we want to go , &quot; &quot; says Anni@@ ka Deu@@ sch@@ le . &quot;
&quot; no new refugees , this would be able to relax . &quot;
Reg@@ ine customer also makes clear that the Ur@@ bacher are already busy to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way .
&quot; these are currently around 100 people , mainly young men . &quot;
&quot; but if people are in need , they must help them , both women agree . &quot;
&quot; the political world situation is so complicated , there are no simple answers . &quot;
Sch@@ orn@@ dorf : bur@@ gl@@ ar looking for helicop@@ ters
the police helicopter flew different areas for about one hour - un@@ successful .
two unknown men moved viol@@ ently into an apartment in a multi @-@ family house on Friday morning at 8.@@ 50 a.m. on Friday morning .
the inhabitants surprised the two and struck the w@@ reck@@ age into the escape .
&quot; the two men were about 1.@@ 65 to 1.@@ 70 meters large , well mas@@ ked , bore both Blue@@ jeans and black hoo@@ dies . &quot;
they fled towards the city centre .
&quot; for the investigation , the police deployed several squ@@ ab@@ bles and a police helicopter . &quot;
the flag was without success .
&quot; eventually , the unknown in front of the apartment fell short of the apartment or her escape . &quot;
Baden @-@ Württemberg : police determined after ro@@ cker attack on snacks

Thurin@@ gia : Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec has come closer to turnover billion
a high demand for medical technology in Asia has stimulated sales of Carl Zei@@ ss Medi@@ tec .
&quot; group sales rose by 6.@@ 7 percent to € 79@@ 8.@@ 6 million in the first nine months of the financial year , such as the listed company on Friday in Jena . &quot;
