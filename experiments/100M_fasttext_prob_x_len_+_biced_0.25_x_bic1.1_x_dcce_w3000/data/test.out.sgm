<seg id="1">Golfer Langer receives the sports pyramid</seg>
<seg id="2">His experiences on the horse are manageable.</seg>
<seg id="3">At the end of a golf tournament in South Africa Bernhard Langer with some colleagues sought a bit of diversion with a ride on the beach.</seg>
<seg id="4">For the 58-year-old it was a premiere.</seg>
<seg id="5">CHIO: "golden sports pyramid" for Bernhard Langer</seg>
<seg id="6">"after a few minutes, the horses remembered their holiday, they hunted at the fast gallop home to the feed troughs."</seg>
<seg id="7">"one kilometer at this pace, I was afraid."</seg>
<seg id="8">"it was not a good experience," Langer says. "</seg>
<seg id="9">"and with that, the riding career then ended up again."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on Saturday, Germany's best golfer was - 101 tournament victories - again near horses."</seg>
<seg id="11">"he let his family run over the grounds of the ALRV, on a horse he didn't even hover for photo purposes."</seg>
<seg id="12">It was the first time in Aachen and thus at CHIO.</seg>
<seg id="13">The reason was quite convincing.</seg>
<seg id="14">The German sports team handed over to the man from Anhausen in the course of a small gala the golden sports pyramid.</seg>
<seg id="15">The likeable sportsman does not lack accolades.</seg>
<seg id="16">"Federal Cross of Merit, Silver bay leaf, Champions Tour player of the year..."</seg>
<seg id="17">Even the British Queen has already adored him.</seg>
<seg id="18">The 18th prize winner of the sports pyramid is a long one.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Aachen, on Saturday, he met the first prize-winner Hans Günter Winkler."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this award means a lot to me," says Langer, "because it is not only awarded for sporting achievements but also for social commitment."</seg>
<seg id="21">"for decades, Langer has been promoting the offspring."</seg>
<seg id="22">"and so he also gave the prize money of 25,000 euros straight away."</seg>
<seg id="23">"with 15 other outstanding athletes, the two-time US-Masterssieger was admitted to the" Hall of Fame of German Sports "on Saturday."</seg>
<seg id="24">"the skiers are the athletes of Hartwig Gauder and Harald Schmitt, the finer Cornelia Hanisch, Alexander Pusch and Arnd Schmitt, the Ruderer Peter-Michael Kolbe, the Judoka Frank Wieneke, the jumper Alwin Schockemöhle and posthumously the Handballer Erhard Wunderlich."</seg>
<seg id="25">Many of these sportsmen came to Aachen on Saturday.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after the official part, the illustrious company moved to the Springstadium, where the Lavazza price was running."</seg>
<seg id="27">Bernhard Langer kept distance to the big animals.</seg>

<seg id="1">Clinton's and Trump economic policy in comparison: it's all about the money</seg>
<seg id="2">Invest in infrastructure and prevent the trade agreement TTP - both Clinton and Trump want.</seg>
<seg id="3">"however, the two US presidential candidates are unequal in tax and energy policy as well as in a fundamental issue."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the difference in economic policy between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton is a fundamental, rather philosophical distinction."</seg>
<seg id="5">On the role of the state.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in doubt, Trump wants to keep in doubt small and cautiously cautions about how the state can harm the economy - with taxes and regulations."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Clinton wants to tax the economy and regulate it to death, he says."</seg>
<seg id="8">"he himself would be quite different, claiming Trump."</seg>
<seg id="9">"he will massively decline regulations, and he is strong for a far-reaching tax reform with lower tax rates - for private individuals and for companies."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on the other hand, Clinton says: the state has to fulfill certain tasks, it has to open disadvantaged opportunities and needs money for it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"that is why taxes for the rich would be increased, they say."</seg>
<seg id="12">"interestingly, both are very close to infrastructure."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in the case of the need to invest, Trump and Clinton say almost verbose."</seg>
<seg id="14">The democratic candidate actually announces the largest investment in new jobs since World War II.</seg>
<seg id="15">State investment programmes in infrastructure are classic democratic policies and are strictly rejected by the Republicans' state-critical wing.</seg>
<seg id="16">"on Trump, there could be still party-internal discussions."</seg>
<seg id="17">The differences in energy and climate policy are clear.</seg>
<seg id="18">Trump wants to build coal-fired power plants and re-drive coal mining in the USA.</seg>
<seg id="19">"oil production should also be possible in so far protected areas, he wants to announce the Parisian climate protection agreement."</seg>
<seg id="20">"Clinton, on the other hand, wants to extend and demand renewable energies with its investment program:" "a country will become the superpower of clean energy and create millions jobs."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it will be either China, Germany or America - I want it to be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"but not only with the infrastructure - even in international trade agreements, the two competitors are not too far apart from each other."</seg>
<seg id="23">"TPP, the transpitfish trade agreement, both do not want to sign."</seg>
<seg id="24">"at the same time, both of them want to isolate the US from international trade - rather than protect American jobs better."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they should then be paid better, e.g. Clinton."</seg>
<seg id="26">The current minimum wage of $7.25 is a hunger strike.</seg>
<seg id="27">He wants to increase it to 15 dollars a hour.</seg>
<seg id="28">"what Trump wants to do in this question is not quite clear: once he says: the minimum wage has to rise, then he says he cannot be changed."</seg>
<seg id="29">But the big discussion of the coming months is likely to be more likely to develop the fiscal policy of the two camps.</seg>
<seg id="30">"on the one hand, Trump, who wants to relieve the economy and citizens in order to boost growth."</seg>
<seg id="31">His critics regard it so that the budget deficit would be even greater.</seg>
<seg id="32">"on the other hand, Clinton, at least wants to demand from the rich that they pay more taxes, and their critics say: more taxes are not the solution either."</seg>

<seg id="2">"sexual violence belongs to women who flee alone, almost everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="3">"when they arrive in Germany, they are often traumatized."</seg>
<seg id="4">A house offers refuge.</seg>
<seg id="5">Four women are sitting in a large kitchen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"each one has a baby, which is at most one year old."</seg>
<seg id="7">One has put her little son in his arm.</seg>
<seg id="8">He looked curiously into the room with big eyes.</seg>
<seg id="9">His mother stares at the top of the table.</seg>
<seg id="10">Until she notices that she is being watched.</seg>
<seg id="11">She smiles short and kisses the little ones.</seg>
<seg id="12">The scene seems normal.</seg>
<seg id="13">Until you talk with Katrin Bahr.</seg>
<seg id="14">"she is the managing director of Condrobs, a carrier for social assistance in Bavaria, and deals with the topic of women on the run."</seg>
<seg id="15">The four women in the kitchen are Poultry.</seg>
<seg id="16">They live in the Munich North in one of the few decentral accommodations for single-fledged women and their children in Bavaria.</seg>
<seg id="17">"in January, Condrobs created the facility together with Pro Familia and the Munich Women's Aid."</seg>
<seg id="18">Recently it was officially opened.</seg>
<seg id="19">60 people live there - about 40 women and 20 children.</seg>
<seg id="20">Men are not there - also not as a visitor.</seg>
<seg id="21">The exception is a guard at the door.</seg>
<seg id="22">"it is not exaggerated to say: every woman who arrives here has had experiences with sexual violence on her flight," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="23">"men flee because of wars because they are persecuted politically because they threaten torture or death, or because their families send them hope to Europe," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"in women, there are other reasons for the flight:" "many steal away secretly, because they see no other way out."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in their homeland they have experience with sexual violence, forced marriages, honor morals, slavery or forced prostitution."</seg>
<seg id="26">That is what drives them away.</seg>
<seg id="27">On the run it goes on.</seg>
<seg id="28">"that smugglers, for example, demand a sexual act for a bottle of water, is not rarity," says Bahr. "</seg>
<seg id="29">"the women are alone, they are not protected by their families."</seg>
<seg id="30">"who believes that the end, as soon as they arrive in Germany, irre, tells Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="31">"here too, single women in refugee shelters would often be considered inferior and misused at worst."</seg>
<seg id="32">"this leads to the fact that about 90 percent of women residing in the South of Munich are traumatized, they appreciate it."</seg>
<seg id="33">"some of the children are certainly not volunteered."</seg>
<seg id="34">Many women are used to saying nothing.</seg>
<seg id="35">"or they dare not speak openly about the experience, because the shame is too great."</seg>
<seg id="36">"as they often don't know how to help, more accommodations only require for them, requiring Bahr."</seg>
<seg id="37">"in Bavaria, the seven district governments are responsible for the housing of refugees."</seg>
<seg id="38">"on the question of whether they knew about a similar project like in Munich in their jurisdiction, some respond with no."</seg>
<seg id="39">"in the Upper Palatinate and Upper Franconia, for example, there is no such thing in shelters of the governments."</seg>
<seg id="40">"even in Swabia alone, winged women are not accommodated separately, says Karl-Heinz Meyer, press spokesperson for the government."</seg>
<seg id="41">"in Upper Bavaria, Lower and Central Franconia there are floors or own houses only for single women and their children."</seg>
<seg id="42">"the exception is Lower Bavaria, there are two central accommodations exclusively for women."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the committee" "Rights of Women and Gender Equality" "in the European Parliament calls for women to be lodged separately by men."</seg>
<seg id="44">"in a study published for the committee, it says:" it is very important that men and women are accommodated separately. "</seg>
<seg id="45">"if privacy is missing or if men and women are accommodated together, there can be - perpetual - violence against women."</seg>
<seg id="46">"above all, the washrooms should be separate and accessible to women, it is in the study."</seg>
<seg id="47">"how much the women feel this need of protection can be read at the rush, which there is on the house in Munich."</seg>
<seg id="48">"since it has been around for us, we have a long waiting list," "says Bahr."</seg>

<seg id="2">Assistant physicians have called for their union to approve new employment campaigns in their disputes regarding a new contract.</seg>
<seg id="3">The Junior Doctors Committee (JDC) of the British Medical Association (BMA) has called for its entire Council to approve more work combat measures from the beginning of September.</seg>
<seg id="4">The JDC said that ministers had agreed to deal with the concerns of the contract.</seg>
<seg id="5">"in July, assistance and medical students agreed on the rejection of a contract agreed with the BMA."</seg>
<seg id="6">He was rejected by 58% of his members voted in the elections.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in a letter to the members who were published on Twitter on Thursday evening, the Chairman of the JDC Ellen McCourt said that the government would have remained" stubbornly "to problems, which led to the treaty being rejected."</seg>
<seg id="8">"she said," "considering this, the JDC Bureau has agreed to fully reject the proposed new treaty and challenge official negotiations on all your concerns."</seg>
<seg id="9">"as an answer to the government's silence, the JDC Executive Board today put a formal request for a special meeting of the BMA Council to approve a running program of escalating labor fighting measures that begins at the beginning of September."</seg>

<seg id="1">Russia and Turkey: an "alliance of outsiders"?</seg>
<seg id="2">It was a gesture that ended a crisis.</seg>
<seg id="3">The leaders of Russia and Turkey met on Tuesday to give themselves the hands and to proclaim an official end of the eight-month war of words and economic sanctions.</seg>
<seg id="4">"but when Vladimir Putin receives his Turkish counterpart in the gilded hall of the St. Petersburg palace, I cannot deny that Ankara wants this reconciliation."</seg>
<seg id="5">"there was a handshake, yes."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but Putin smiles broadly and he barely radiated warmth, even for his restrained conditions."</seg>
<seg id="7">"Recep Tayyip Erdogan, on the other hand, repeatedly spoke of his" dear friend "Putin - according to a report of all five times."</seg>
<seg id="8">I couldn't count it any more.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he also promised that relations with Russia would not only return to their old level before the crisis, but even to improve."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the next day, a newspaper described that Erdogan would have behaved as if there had never been anything worse."</seg>
<seg id="11">To me his enthusiasm seemed rather the opposite.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but one of Putin emblasted, sustainable cool showed that Russia's head of state had forgotten nothing."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rather, the cause of the crisis was the first thing he mentioned in its introductory words: the downshot of a Russian fighter plane at the Syrian border through Turkey."</seg>
<seg id="14">Moscow's reaction to the time was furious.</seg>
<seg id="15">Putin shared Ankara and accused Ankara of falling into the backs of Russia.</seg>
<seg id="16">The offence was even greater since it was perpetrated by a supposed friend.</seg>
<seg id="17">Building up the uncle will be difficult if not even impossible.</seg>
<seg id="18">The public opinion in Russia has changed since November.</seg>
<seg id="19">"for months, the state controlled media triggered a violent, unrestricted attack on Ankara."</seg>
<seg id="20">At one time it seemed as if the Turks were to blame for everything.</seg>
<seg id="21">"most serious were the accusations by senior officials that Erdogan's own family would have benefited from illegal oil trading in Syria, controlled by the so-called Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="22">He has denied this vehemently.</seg>
<seg id="23">"but in St. Petersburg, the official message was that it was time to look forward."</seg>
<seg id="24">"finally, this meeting took place only because Putin was apologized by President Erdogan, whom he wanted to hear."</seg>
<seg id="25">Russia could book a kind of victory.</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Ankara, the advantages of a cease-fire are obvious."</seg>
<seg id="27">"Erdogan, first and foremost, needs all the friends he can get after finishing almost his office last month with a failed coup d'etat."</seg>
<seg id="28">Repeated terrorist attacks on Turkey have also shaken it.</seg>
<seg id="29">But there are also economic motives.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Russian sanctions have hit Turkey hard - in particular the ban on charter flights, which every year usually bring several million Russian tourists to the Turkish coast."</seg>
<seg id="31">The number has declined by almost 90%.</seg>
<seg id="32">"in Russia, tour operators and charter companies will be relieved when flights are resumed."</seg>
<seg id="33">They count on a late seasonal rush to the Mediterranean Sea.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this week, the state television projected cheap fruits and vegetables as soon as the Turkish agrarian imports are allowed again."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a report in Vedemosti formulated it as follows:" "tourists there long, tomatoes here long."</seg>
<seg id="36">But the visit had an additional political value for Moscow.</seg>
<seg id="37">"Ankara is angry at the West, as it responds to the attempted takeover of power as a weak response."</seg>
<seg id="38">"in addition, the ongoing resentment of the EU accession negotiations and Putin's snail speed is to benefit from the cool atmosphere and to reduce Turkey's relationship to the West."</seg>
<seg id="39">"the Russian head of state won a bonus in Ankara for a bonus that, after the attempted coup d'etat, demanded support for the elected state organs."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is a matter of course for Moscow, which even has a deep-seated fear of regime change."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the summit in this splendid palace by the sea allowed Russia and Turkey to present one, as an analyst once described to me," "Alliance of outsiders" ": two countries that feel rejected and badly treated by the West and are now allied."</seg>
<seg id="42">"nevertheless, in spite of the public reconciliation, there are still great differences between the two."</seg>
<seg id="43">"the biggest difference is Syria, where Moscow has recently played the role as a peacemakers, but where Russia and Turkey support opposing sides."</seg>
<seg id="44">"it might be significant that after almost three hours of initial talks, both presidents at the press conference said they did not even seize the subject."</seg>
<seg id="45">"the President of Turkey deliberately avoided answering a question about their differences, while Putin decided to emphasise it."</seg>
<seg id="46">There is no clear consensus on where a common denominator can be found in Syria.</seg>
<seg id="47">"but after months of open hostilities - and in the face of the potential for a complete disaster, when NATO member Turkey poured the Russian military jet, it is certainly better that the two Heads of State are talking at least once again."</seg>

<seg id="6">"at this time, brand strategists" RBS "have used to protect other end-consumer-brands."</seg>

<seg id="13">McEwan was interviewed during a sightseeing tour by customers and employees in Inverness-Shire.</seg>
<seg id="14">"he divided the BBC Scotland with:" "the brand RSB will become our investor-brand and the brand under which our employees will be busy, as we now become more to a bank of brands."</seg>

<seg id="16">"I say now that we do not pursue global goals, but local objectives."</seg>
<seg id="17">Each of these brands will stand for something completely different in their own communities and our employees will work with the customers under these brands.</seg>
<seg id="18">RBS has already stated that it will no longer carry out its Six Nations sponsoring and that it will increase the perceptibility of the different brands in its sport sponsorship.</seg>
<seg id="19">"it's time for us to develop to the bank of the brands, because how do we concentrate inside (we asked) to make this a better bank for customers?" said the Chairman of the board. "</seg>

<seg id="7">"Vaino, 44, is a former diplomat."</seg>
<seg id="8">"born in the Estonian capital of Tallinn in 1972, he graduated from the prestigious Moscow Institute for International Relations (MGIMO) and worked in the Tokyo embassy."</seg>
<seg id="9">"on the Kremlin's website, it is called (in Russian) that he later became the chief executive director and chief executive officer."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on his appointment, he said to Putin," "Thank you for your confidence." ""</seg>
<seg id="11">I think it is the most important task of the government to support your activity as head of state in regard to bills of law and controls to implement your instructions.</seg>
<seg id="12">Putin shared the Russian TV station on Friday that Ivanov asked to leave his post and recommended Vaino as his successor.</seg>
<seg id="13">Convince the smiling faces?</seg>
<seg id="14">This step has made Moscow mysterious.</seg>
<seg id="15">"Sergei Ivanov was one of Vladimir Putin's closest friends for a long time, working as he for the Soviet intelligence service, the KGB."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as Chief of Staff, he was one of the most powerful men in the country."</seg>
<seg id="17">"at a meeting with President Putin on television broadcasted, both men claimed that the Chief of Staff resigned on his own request."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but despite the smile for the cameras, only a few of them are convinced - especially now, just before the parliamentary elections."</seg>
<seg id="19">So here is the consequence of a kind of power struggle?</seg>
<seg id="20">Nobody knows this at this time.</seg>
<seg id="21">"but the official assertion - that a man, once touted as a potential president, would like to lead the Russian environmental policy - met great skepticism."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in his remarks to Putin, quoted on the Kremlin's website, Ivanov said," "It is true that I asked you in a conversation at the beginning of 2012 - you could almost say - to put on a complaint for four years."</seg>
<seg id="23">"as it turns out, I have been chairman of the Russian Presidential Administration for four years and eight months."</seg>
<seg id="24">IVANOV took the post in December 2011.</seg>
<seg id="25">"prior to that, he was Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence."</seg>
<seg id="26">He is a member of the Russian Security Council and as Putin ex-member of the State Security Service KGB.</seg>
<seg id="27">"in the late 1990s, when Putin was chairman of the Federal Security Service (FSB), who replaced the KGB, Ivanov was appointed his deputy."</seg>
<seg id="28">"when Putin came to power, he called Ivanov as one of five people whom he trusted most."</seg>
<seg id="29">"once it was believed that after Putin's second term of office, Ivanov could become president of Russia, since a third term of Putin had violated the constitution."</seg>
<seg id="30">"but this post was taken by another, close allies of Putin, Dmitry Medvedev."</seg>

<seg id="2">The budget of the £1.35 billion will be completed by May 2017</seg>
<seg id="3">"engineers connected the north deck of the Queensferry crossings with the Viaduct, which means that the bridge is now connected to Fife."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is the first of four closures of the" "Deckblower", "which will approach the completion of each of the three towers of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the bridge section of Fife is now 600 meters long and weighs 30,000 tons."</seg>
<seg id="6">"it has 10,000 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of concrete and 46 oblique ropes."</seg>
<seg id="7">The budget of £1.35 billion will be completed by May 2017.</seg>
<seg id="8">Minister Keith Brown visited the building site today and was one of the first to go from the country to the bridge.</seg>
<seg id="9">"he said," "This is a historic and symbolic moment when you build Queensferry crossings."</seg>
<seg id="10">"we are all witnesses of an engineering art of a truly epic degree in this project with more than 30,000 tons of concrete and steel that were used alone for this part of the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="11">"despite the massive size and weight of the bridge, completion of the connection between the viaduct and the bridge deck is a tricky job that requires extremely precise tolerances for fit."</seg>
<seg id="12">"all in all, almost 79% of the total bridge deck is in its place and the last section of the deck today gets a concrete flow in Rosyth, which means that the entire deck is ready to be lifted to its place on the bridge."</seg>
<seg id="13">"Michael Martin, Project Manager of Forth Crossing Bridge Constructors said:" the first closure represents a significant milestone for each bridge project. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"with this fantastic project, the closure is a forward-looking high and low construction."</seg>
<seg id="15">"after the installation of the last section of the road and its connection with the north tower on the north, we had to close the existing gap between the north and the north."</seg>
<seg id="16">This was reached by pulling the northern feeder bridge 700 millimeters south.</seg>
<seg id="17">This was a massive and at the same time very delicate activity.</seg>
<seg id="18">"massive because the Viaduct is 222 meters long, weighs about 6,000 tons and had to be pulled upwards at an incline of about 3%."</seg>
<seg id="19">"as the tolerances on which the team were working, they were tiny - on each side they only fertilized a few millimetres."</seg>

<seg id="1">Who builds Braunschweig's cheap apartments?</seg>
<seg id="2">The SPD and the Greens mean: investors should be put into duty more strongly in future.</seg>
<seg id="3">How do you react to the bad news that Braunschweig will lose nearly 1300 budget apartments over the next few years?</seg>
<seg id="4">The SPD will propose a "concept of action" at the next council meeting.</seg>
<seg id="5">But dispute is programmed.</seg>
<seg id="6">First and foremost it's about the question: who should build the cheap apartments actually?</seg>
<seg id="7">A regulation is missing until now.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the SPD leader, Christoph Bratmann, says:" "we agree with the Greens: whoever wants to build on urban areas will have to report 20 percent of all apartments as social housing in the future."</seg>
<seg id="9">"however, the cheap apartments can also be built in the continuance."</seg>
<seg id="10">"however, the big conflict in the town hall is," said Bratmann, "How do you deal with investors who want to build on private planes?"</seg>
<seg id="11">"we want investors to build at least 10 percent on such areas, but build as much as 20 percent of the apartments as social housing."</seg>
<seg id="12">"a new urban housing construction supporting programme, which will cost millions and needs to be financed, should provide incentives for incentives."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the problem, said Bratmann:" there is no agreement between the factions at the moment. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The CDU wants to make investors as few as possible.</seg>
<seg id="15">The left wants to make even harder print runs for investors.</seg>
<seg id="16">"despite this, such as Bratmann, there is a sharpening of the situation in the housing market."</seg>
<seg id="17">"if the action plan is implemented, it will take care of additional tasks in the construction management."</seg>
<seg id="18">More staff is required.</seg>
<seg id="19">It is not clear whether we will get the skilled workers.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the programme is not yet complete: the approximately 1260 new apartments, which should be built anyway."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but how do you balance the loss of some 1,300 cheap apartments, whose funding will expire over the next few years?"</seg>
<seg id="22">"by 2020 alone, there will be 500 apartments."</seg>
<seg id="23">"to prevent this, according to the planning policy spokeswoman Nicole palm, the city should now be purchased from the city."</seg>
<seg id="24">"in addition, it would have to be rethought of bringing apartments back into the price binding."</seg>
<seg id="25">This is possible in the western city.</seg>
<seg id="26">"at one stroke, the problem could be solved."</seg>
<seg id="27">"because in the west city, the year-ends meet deadlines."</seg>
<seg id="28">Around 1800 apartments could be retrieved from there back into the price binding for cheap apartments.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only: they do not want the owners, the housing associations."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is because the number of social housing in the west city is increased dramatically from the goal of so-called mixing.</seg>
<seg id="31">There should be no more concentration of social weak in just a few parts of the city.</seg>
<seg id="32">The Greens reckon that there will be some movement in the discussion.</seg>
<seg id="33">"said S & D vice-president Holger Herlitschke:" "for a large majority, the CDU must go into the boat."</seg>
<seg id="34">"indeed, I have concentrated on more building sites for single-family homes."</seg>

<seg id="2">It is fascinating to see how the world changes.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the fact that teenagers and children are no longer going to play outside, but rather prefer to spend their leisure time sitting on screens, has been lamented by many in the last decade."</seg>
<seg id="4">Pokemon Go is about getting people from the sofa and becoming more active.</seg>
<seg id="5">"the time on the screen was initially limited to the TV, then on video games and last on smartphones."</seg>
<seg id="6">"therefore, it is great to see that technology and outdoor activities do not mutually exclude each other."</seg>
<seg id="7">"of course I refer to Pokémon Go-Wahn, an app that is based on the characters created for the video games in the 1990ies (later created a cartoon series, playing cards and other spin-offs)."</seg>
<seg id="8">"how many phenomena of pop culture decreased interest before publishing the game in the USA, Australia and New Zealand in early July."</seg>
<seg id="9">The market launch in other countries has been postponed by the massive demand that overloads the servers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"within a few days, Pokémon Go had more users than Tinder and almost as many as Twitter."</seg>
<seg id="11">How does it work?</seg>
<seg id="12">"in short, players go outside with their smartphones and search for Pokemon which are tracked with a GPS and once they were found" photographed "(via a screenshot on the phone) or" captured. ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"a generation that played the game when she was younger, joined the track and jumped for the search of the sofa."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the US, the game led to a considerable rise in steps that the" average "person returns every day."</seg>
<seg id="15">"Cardiogram, an app for Apple Watch, which pursues 35,000 users, the Washington Post recently announced that within two days of launching the game, the number of follow-up people who train every day 30 minutes, from 45 percent to 53 percent."</seg>
<seg id="16">The company does not know who plays this Pokémon Go - it merely looks for raw data to increase performance.</seg>
<seg id="17">"many public awareness campaigns on the health that people want to take" "30 minutes of time", "" "coming from the sofa" "and" "being active every day" "on deaf ears, because many public messages to health are boring and come from people who look miserable."</seg>
<seg id="18">"however, the importance of sport cannot be overvalued."</seg>
<seg id="19">"who regularly pursues sports, reduces his chances of suffering from cancer or depression."</seg>
<seg id="20">"physical activity helps in weight control, high blood pressure, diabetes and a long list of benefits that are too long to guide them here."</seg>
<seg id="21">But the miracle of Pokémon Go is that it brings people to do something outdoors that makes them fun.</seg>
<seg id="22">"thus three pillars of health are covered - exercise, fresh air and sunshine as well as fun."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some people even close new friendships when hunting.</seg>
<seg id="24">"as always, there are also grumpy game-destroyers, who always have to complain about something."</seg>
<seg id="25">"and yes, someone could walk against a door."</seg>
<seg id="26">What is it supposed to?</seg>
<seg id="27">A breakthrough has occurred.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even if smartphone apps like Fitbit have already been able to track our activity earlier, they didn't give us a reason to do sports as it does this game."</seg>
<seg id="29">The new will lose its appeal and the use will be recreated over time.</seg>
<seg id="30">"however, due to poker's success, there will be more games that will unite apps and virtual reality with the active will in the real world and help many people in the hunt to be more active, more active and healthier."</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to police reports published on Thursday, two women and a 12-year-old girl were shot, killed in one of the deadliest attacks since a decade in the first mass murderous hit by Phoenix, while they chatted in the car and listened to music."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Angela Rochelle Liner, Stefanie R. Ellis and Ellis daughter Maleah were shot on June 12, while the car was parked in a driveway, the authorities said."</seg>

<seg id="11">Metereologist Alek Krautmann says that both rivers could flooded many houses in the suburbs near Baton Rouge.</seg>

<seg id="1">"why we need Simone, Gabby and Laurie"</seg>
<seg id="2">That is what I imagine at the Women's Olympics in Turning and that for more than one reason.</seg>
<seg id="3">"first, I have been part of every summer Olympics since 1984 and the US has never been so dominant."</seg>
<seg id="4">"second: this team has three gymnasts, Simone Biles, Gabby Douglas and Lauren" Laurie "Hernandez, which inspired many young girls of other skin color."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the structure of this team, the Aly Raisman, the Jew and Madison Kocian, who is Catholics, makes everyone proud."</seg>
<seg id="6">This team finally reflects the USA.</seg>
<seg id="7">It has solidified the black and hispanic female presence at the top of this sport.</seg>
<seg id="8">"in the last four years, the number one among female gymnasts was an Afro-American."</seg>
<seg id="9">Last year Simone and Gabby were # 1 and # 2.</seg>
<seg id="10">This shows strength.</seg>
<seg id="11">"at the last Olympic Games, Gabby Douglas was a surprise Olympic winner and America cheered."</seg>
<seg id="12">"now the world was able to witness the incredible performance of the triple world champion Simone Biles, Douglas and Laurie Hernandez, as they did unexpected but masterly Gymasculine routines."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on Thursday, Simone was the fourth, heterosexual American who won gold at an individual multi-campaign event."</seg>
<seg id="14">Team member Aly Raisman won silver.</seg>
<seg id="15">"we experience the top of this sport, but we do not see sports classes in the whole country."</seg>
<seg id="16">Simone and Gabby and Laurie all beat the same way as Aly and Madison to make it into the Olympic team.</seg>
<seg id="17">"they are the" Last Five "because the next Olympic team will have only four teams in the team. in addition, this is the last year with Marta Karolyi as a trainer."</seg>
<seg id="18">"but the reality looks like gymnastics are an expensive sport and Turner primarily in private turntables, which are maintained by parents who pay for training, orientation, travel, competitive and hotel costs (for the trainers and their families and families)."</seg>
<seg id="19">The majority of this turnout lie in affluent suburbs that can support the business.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in these clubs, the Turner get their entire training and that is an expensive and long-term commitment to the families."</seg>
<seg id="21">"Aimee Boorman, Simone Biles, and Maggie Haney, trainer of Laurie Hernandez, have both trained their athletes since they started with the gymnastics."</seg>
<seg id="22">"we have to give the municipalities aun innumerable, young girls inspired by Simone, Gabby and Laurie, an affordable and easy to access exercise bike."</seg>
<seg id="23">I founded my gymnasium of 20 years.</seg>
<seg id="24">"at my events, we have offered free and affordable turnes in Harlem for more than 15,000 urban juveniles (especially black and Hispanic) and trained national and international winners."</seg>
<seg id="25">"in September we will expand to Detroit (my hometown) to offer high-quality gymnastics, which deserve the opportunity to learn and benefit from this great Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="26">"gymnastics develops strength, flexibility, and coordination for the body as well as hard work, discipline and determination for the mind."</seg>
<seg id="27">This combination offers life-long benefits for health as well as for school and professional success.</seg>
<seg id="28">It is the inspiration of this team that brings thousands of young girls to interest in the gymnasium and that's great.</seg>
<seg id="29">"it is so important to participate in sports, especially for girls."</seg>
<seg id="30">This is such an exciting time.</seg>
<seg id="31">"thanks Simone, Aly, Laurie, Gabby and Madison for this genuine representation of" Girl Power "by holding the Olympic team golds and thank you, you motivate so many young girls with different backgrounds to start their way to become healthy, strong and successful young women."</seg>

<seg id="2">"the ministers hoped to end the dispute over the changes by adopting a reformed treaty with the officials of the British Medical Association, but 58 percent of the 37.000 Assistant Doctors who voted in favor of a vote rejected it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Culture of Political Correctness makes electoral fraud blooming in Muslim areas</seg>
<seg id="2">"last year, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets Lutry Rahman was removed from office due to corruption."</seg>
<seg id="3">A culture of Political Correctness has led to the fact that widespread electoral fraud in Muslim communities is knowingly ignored as a devastating government report today revealed.</seg>
<seg id="4">"Sir Eric Pickles, former cabinet member, verbally attacks the police, election observers and town halls to ignore proof of election abuse based on" "hypersensitivity to ethnicity and religion". ""</seg>
<seg id="5">"the former Minister for Integration and Local Government, who is now an anti-corruption king, said that the intimidation of voters from religious motives would be so bad that the police should be allowed to set off barriers outside of elective cabins, in order to protect intimidated voters."</seg>
<seg id="6">"he recommends that voters should take a passport with them, in order to prove their identity in elections."</seg>
<seg id="7">"at present, a voter merely needs to name his name and address."</seg>
<seg id="8">The report proposes to apply non-removable ink to a person's finger when they vote on their vote to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="9">"whistleblowers should receive more protection, says Sir Eric."</seg>
<seg id="10">He demands that the press should have more access to municipal documents and decisions of unofficial committees or working groups.</seg>
<seg id="11">"this serves not only against electoral fraud, but is also to protect the municipal government from the wider corruption and fiscal culture associated with it," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="12">The report was ordered by Downing Street as a result of Tower Hamlet's election scandal in eastern London.</seg>
<seg id="13">"last year, a special court ruled that the reigning mayor Lutsk Rahman should be dismissed after a litany of corrupt and illegal practices of his ministry."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the Court found that Rahman had" "pervert the religious feelings of his Muslim community" "and that he had silenced his critics with racism and Islamophobia."</seg>
<seg id="15">Rahman is said to have led his campaign on the basis that it was the religious duty of Muslims to choose him.</seg>
<seg id="16">Up to 300 votes were either doubtful or the result of imitation in which a person was chosen as someone else.</seg>
<seg id="17">Sir Eric said there was evidence of fraud throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in particular, he voiced alarm on the fraudulent choice of letters - in which older members of the Muslim community had made pressure on people to choose candidates of their choice."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Sir Eric, pictured, made several recommendations to clean the electoral system, including guiding out to prove the identity"</seg>
<seg id="20">"in his report it says:" "evidence has been made that pressure on vulnerable members of some ethnic minorities has been exercised, especially women and young people in order to choose according to the will of the elderly, in particular communities with Pakistan or Bangladeshi background."</seg>
<seg id="21">There were concerns that... state institutions would have knowingly ignored such behavior on the basis of "politically correct" hypersensitivity to the ethnicity and religion.</seg>
<seg id="22">"Sir Eric spoke out 50 recommendations to clean the system, including the prohibition that political activists manipulate letter codes to stop" "electing". ""</seg>
<seg id="23">"the report, which is considered by Theresa May, also requires tougher registration checks to prevent the electoral list being used for immigration and social fraud."</seg>
<seg id="24">Consider options to ask voters before choosing your ID.</seg>
<seg id="25">Use non-removable ink on the finger of a person as soon as she has given her voice to prevent someone choosing twice.</seg>
<seg id="26">Systematic reviews of the nationality of a person perform to ensure that they are optional.</seg>
<seg id="27">A three-year limit on applications for an automatic postal voting.</seg>
<seg id="28">Prohibition that political activist edit full briefings and envelopes from postelections.</seg>
<seg id="29">"" "give the police the authority to set up barriers to election-stations."</seg>
<seg id="30">A change of legislation which facilitates an accusation of intimidation in accordance with the People Act 1983 (People's Representation Act 1983).</seg>
<seg id="31">Photographing in polling stations.</seg>
<seg id="32">Requirement that only English can be used in the polling stations (except Wales).</seg>
<seg id="33">"intensification of the training, in order to ensure that employees enforce the rule that voters go alone in the voting booth."</seg>
<seg id="34">Sir Eric coincides with the Metropolitan Police and finds it "amazing" that after the Tower Hamlets there was no complaint.</seg>
<seg id="35">"the election court has declared Luton Rahman and his deputy for a litany of corrupt and illegal practices as unsuitable," he said. "</seg>
<seg id="36">"due to a number of reasons, it was found guilty - in line with the high demands of criminal proceedings."</seg>
<seg id="37">He also criticises the ineffective "ticking controls" of the elective registration departments of the Town Hall.</seg>
<seg id="38">Sir Eric said: "the court ruling in Tower Hamlets last year was a warning signal.</seg>
<seg id="39">"our country bears a proud heritage as the mother of parliaments, but the worrying and covert spread of electoral fraud and denial of some authorities threaten this good reputation."</seg>

<seg id="8">"standing in the middle of the shop floor, she took a pair of underpants from the delivery, pulled out her own tights and trousers and tasted them."</seg>

<seg id="3">"we talked to Rhone Mizrachi, a Grand Master of the Krav Maga Association in New York, to find out how to deal with armed robbers at close distance."</seg>
<seg id="4">"regardless of whether you approach you from the front or from behind, this video will show you how to turn your skewer to the skewer."</seg>
<seg id="5">"if you are approaching you from behind, then you should turn around as first so that you can see your attacker and" go out of the shot, "says Mizrachi."</seg>
<seg id="6">Then take the weapon between your forearm and your shoulder before hitting it with your free elbow.</seg>
<seg id="7">Beat him with his knee in the bar and twist the gun out of his hands while the attacker clutches away from pain. strike him with the barrel and move backwards while holding the gun on him.</seg>
<seg id="8">"for attackers approaching from the front, the technique is similar - move your body out of the shot line, grab the gun and twist it so that the attacker can not shoot."</seg>
<seg id="9">"at the same time, shift the weight to the weapon and beat the attacker to the chest, then twist the gun out of its grip before moving backwards and directing the weapon to it."</seg>

<seg id="1">Traveller Ian Wright shabt his tongue in the dirtiest places of Europe for a travel guide</seg>
<seg id="2">A British traveller undertook his immune system and litters of serious testing by licking some of the dirtiest and most disgusting places in Europe.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the presenter and travel author Ian Wright, 51, from Suffolk dropped his course on a Euro bill, a banister at Piccadilly Circus, a rinsing button of a train toilet as well as a public phone in Russia to demonstrate the resilience of his immune system."</seg>
<seg id="4">"before dropping any object, he used a luminometer to show up and show us what he is going to get involved."</seg>
<seg id="5">"but the experiment, which was filmed under the title" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "brought some surprising results."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the thought of leaking the rinsing button of a towing toilet, which has already been used by thousands of others, may be completely repulsive, but in fact there are more bad bacteria in a kitchen sink."</seg>
<seg id="7">"on his journey through Europe, Mr. Wright spoke with doctors and medical professionals concerning the promotion of gut bacteria as well as about his own health."</seg>
<seg id="8">"fortunately, nothing he licked aside was more than a bad aftertaste in the mouth."</seg>
<seg id="9">Wright was known to test the resistance of his bowels by travelling through the world and eating strange as well as wonderful things.</seg>
<seg id="10">"from public handrails to railway stations to rinsing knobs of toilets, the task has definitively put its immune system under a sample"</seg>
<seg id="11">"in the film, he said:" as a child I was relatively inconcerned about my health and I have put all sorts of things in my mouth, earth, worms and mud water. "</seg>
<seg id="12">"in the film, he was able to do justice to his reputation."</seg>
<seg id="13">The only thing he refused was a dirty public toilet in Russia.</seg>
<seg id="14">His sample-painting showed a luminometric rating of more than 4000 units.</seg>
<seg id="15">"compared to this, the luminous number of freshly washed hands amounts to less than 60."</seg>
<seg id="16">"but there was a Russian toilet which he refused to leash after their luminaries count over 4000 units, while freshly washed hands have less than 60"</seg>
<seg id="17">"Mr. Wright and the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio produced the travel film" The Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength, "which shows the number of bacteria in different places like the bathroom."</seg>
<seg id="18">In the film he says: "this comes close to the worst I have geroyed in a toilet.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is nothing worse than that!</seg>
<seg id="20">I won't lick anything here because it is disgusting here.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the Lickhiker's Guide to Inner Strength" was produced in cooperation with the Finnish manufacturer of dairy products Valio.</seg>
<seg id="22">"the company equips Mr. Wright with Valio Gefilus, which contains lactic acid bacteria as well as vitamin C and D to support the extraction of intestinal bacteria and the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="23">"valios Senior Venice President for Snacks, Shafts and New Categories Niko Vuorenmaa says:" we really wanted to offer consumers something new. "</seg>
<seg id="24">Something that is fascinating to look at and at the same time explains the advantages of probiotics.</seg>
<seg id="25">We performed crazy brainstorming that ended that we said "Let's call us Ian."</seg>
<seg id="26">They claim that the interest in intestinal health becomes a global phenomenon</seg>
<seg id="27">"instead of talking about the products, we wanted to put them in a larger context - the good and bad bacteria in our everyday environment, the importance of gut health and how it is linked to the immune system."</seg>
<seg id="28">The growing interest in gut health is a global phenomenon and with the documentary we were able to provide consumers with more information in an interesting way.</seg>
<seg id="29">I also think the film shows that we have a great sense of humour!</seg>
<seg id="30">"Tom Hakala, who directed the film directing, added:" let me say so - I would have lost my respect for Ian if he had tasted some of the things I had instructed him, just like the disgusting Russian toilet, which is shown in the film. "</seg>
<seg id="31">"of course, there were things in which it was easier to bring Ian to lick her and others, in which this was quite difficult."</seg>
<seg id="32">I'm glad we recorded some of these dirty goodies on film.</seg>
<seg id="33">"in a survey conducted by Valio, 84 percent of all surveyed lactic acid bacteria associated with the wellbeing of stomach and bowel and 58 percent said they use at least occasionally products containing attached lactic acid bacteria."</seg>

<seg id="2">"an asocial family left their social flat after a delogiation with a loss of £50,000 because they terrorized their neighbors."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Tanya Skeldon and her partner Shaun Trebilcock were thrown after a long list of complaints from their estate in Saltash, Cornwall."</seg>
<seg id="4">"after they were forcibly removed from their property, shocked employees of the housing cooperative found their property in an irreparable state."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the walls had holes perforated, wooden planks were torn up, rubbish was spread on the floor and graffiti was smeared to the walls."</seg>
<seg id="6">The family has been relocated and it is believed that it now lives in a private accommodation</seg>
<seg id="7">"Donna McEvoy, who works for home management at Cornwall Housing, said she was afraid that the apartment was no longer repaired."</seg>
<seg id="8">She said: "it was an absolute nightmare for people here and I think that people don't have to live in this way.</seg>
<seg id="9">There are many things to consider as this property is probably considered as not as beautiful part of Cornwall.</seg>
<seg id="10">The family is notorious and its reputation is likewise.</seg>
<seg id="11">"the couple had three sons who lived in the apartment in the meantime and the police said that the terror that the family had inflicted was street fights with baseball bats, intimidation of residents, drug abuse, drug trafficking and excessive cries, disputes and curses."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Skeldon, 47, whose name stood on the lease, got an arrangement for antisocial behavior in June."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in some rooms of the house, which may be torn down under certain circumstances, old rubbish was found."</seg>
<seg id="14">"in the estate, in which drugs were traded in the past, the wooden planks were torn up"</seg>
<seg id="15">Neighbours said they had to fight them on the street and regularly invoked the police.</seg>
<seg id="16">Cornwall Housing led her and her partner forcibly from the property after giving them an extended period of 11 weeks to volunteer.</seg>
<seg id="17">The delogiation was cheered by lightened neighbours who said that their lives were made to hell.</seg>
<seg id="18">"one said," "They didn't care for anybody."</seg>
<seg id="19">We lived 20 years next to them and it was always bad.</seg>
<seg id="20">The countless times we call the police here are incredible.</seg>
<seg id="21">"this morning we could not sleep."</seg>
<seg id="22">We got up because it was so quiet here - we are not used to it!</seg>
<seg id="23">"now, where they are finally gone, it will be beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Adam Fitzpatrick, Neighbourhood Enforcement Manager at Cornwall Housing, said it had taken the family to co-operate with local authorities."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the family lived in the house where the police were called at regular intervals, for 20 years"</seg>
<seg id="26">"on the overgrown side of the community house, garbage and old toys were thrown down."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he added:" "it is a shame that the tenant agreed to accept any responsibility for their behaviour and family, as a deletion is always the last step taken into account by Cornwall Housing."</seg>
<seg id="28">This was a very difficult case because the behaviour was extreme and their actions for their neighbours had to be horrible.</seg>
<seg id="29">"I appreciate all the work my team, the Devon and Cornwall police, as well as members of the community who have courageously approached us and have given us the information."</seg>
<seg id="30">I hope that this development will give comfort to some neighbours and convey the message that anti-social behaviour will not be tolerated.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Fitzpatrick said that all three sons had lived at different times in the house, but that they were all over 20."</seg>
<seg id="32">A dirty mattress that is left in one of the bedrooms of the house after deloing on the floor</seg>
<seg id="33">Workers of the house administration will now have to sweep away landmines that surround the house</seg>
<seg id="34">"in 2014, the police carried out a raid in the house and found over 70g of cannabis as well as scales, paraphernals and cash in the amount of £1,700."</seg>
<seg id="35">Skeldon was sentenced to a fine after having found guilty of a class B drug in commercial vision.</seg>
<seg id="36">She claimed that the money was for a tombstone of her son Lee Skeldon who died in a car accident in 2013.</seg>
<seg id="37">"after being homeless, Tanya and her partner are now living in a private accommodation in Plymouth."</seg>
<seg id="38">Many of the rooms of the house were decorated with graffiti.</seg>
<seg id="39">The police say that they will navigate renters who don't cling to the house rules</seg>
<seg id="40">"Angela Crow of the Devon and Cornwall police said that the delogiation was a clear warning to the other tenants, who do not stick to the house rules."</seg>
<seg id="41">"this goes to those who think they can behave without self-reproach, as well as those who have been harmed by such a behaviour," "she said."</seg>
<seg id="42">The Devon and Cornwall police will never tolerate criminal and anti-social behaviour that will continue to work with partners to protect our communities.</seg>

<seg id="4">"after a fraud attempt at a doping control in the Olympic village, Kenya has sent a trainer home."</seg>
<seg id="5">The International Olympic Committee informed me immediately to set up a disciplinary committee in order to investigate the case.</seg>
<seg id="6">"a Kenyan functionary stated that the former Sprinter and today's coach, John Anzrah, have released a urine sample under the name of the 800 metre runner Ferguson Roter in the Olympic village."</seg>
<seg id="7">This was reported to the team leadership of Kenya by the doping controllers.</seg>
<seg id="8">IAAF has requested the IOC for information about the case in order to exert its own investigations into an IAAF speaker.</seg>
<seg id="9">"depending on the results of the investigation and the subsequent measures of the IOC, IAAF will evaluate an evaluation," said the IAAF. "</seg>
<seg id="10">"he (Anzrah) went to the Doping control station and spent himself as Ferguson Roti, handed the sample and signed it," explained Kenias boss de Mission Stephan Arap Soi. "</seg>
<seg id="11">He was in possession of the accreditation of the athlete who stood on the list for training controls of the world anti-doping agency.</seg>
<seg id="12">Ferguson Red had become more than 800 meters in Beijing in 2015.</seg>

<seg id="17">"at the announcement of the more than 2000 doping target controls submitted by the IOC before the Rio Games, it was previously pointed out that especially athletes from Kenya and Russia were targeted."</seg>
<seg id="18">The world anti-doping agency had exerted a lot of pressure on the African country before the summer games in Brazil to create an anti-doping law and a functioning control system.</seg>
<seg id="19">The law was adopted a few weeks before the start of the Olympics.</seg>

<seg id="3">"the lawyer Tasnime Akunjee said that a few weeks ago her family heard about her death in Raqqa, Syria."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it was suspected that it was killed by a Russian air raid in Raqqa, the stronghold of the group in the country, ITV news reported on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="5">"Sultana was 17 years old and, according to her family, died shortly after she had prepared to leave the country-torn country and to return to England."</seg>
<seg id="6">"one can only hope that the only good is in it - as a reminder and warning to others that these are the risks associated with going into a war zone - to stop people from ever making this decision," "said Akunjee."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in February 2015, Sultana and two other maids from the east of London rose to a plane in the direction of Turkey and then into a bus to the Syrian border."</seg>
<seg id="8">Sultanas's family was told that she married an ISIS fighter in Syria - and within a few months she became a widow.</seg>

<seg id="2">"whoever does not fit and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases," says the chairman of the Gülen Foundation Dialogue and World, Ercan Karakoyun. "</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the short term, the Kurdish community of Germany expects tens of thousands of investigators to flee from Turkey to Germany."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the medium term, even" a few hundred thousand "could be seen, the president of the association Ali Toprak believes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"following the coup attempt by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the Kurdish community of Germany is expecting a mass escape to Germany after the coup attempt."</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the short term, I reckon with tens of thousands, in the medium term with a few hundred thousand shelters from Turkey in Germany, if the Erdogan regime continues to fight the minorities and the democratic opposition," "says the President Ali Toprak of the" World "of Friday."</seg>
<seg id="7">"because the government had overtaken Kurdish strongholds with penalties several months ago, there were 500,000 Kurds within Turkey on the run."</seg>
<seg id="8">"after the coup d" état, secular and oppositional ethnic Turks were added. "</seg>
<seg id="9">Many will want to restart in Europe if they continue to be suppressed in Turkey.</seg>
<seg id="10">"it cannot be that a state which itself takes refugees, produces refugees in their own country," said Toprak. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"the head of the Union was complaining about the deliberate settlement of Syrian Arabs in Kurdish, but also in alevitic cities."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, Erdogan wants to increase the exit pressure on the remaining Kurds."</seg>
<seg id="13">"they are the last great minority in Turkey, the Christian Armenians and Greeks have already been eradicated or displaced in the past hundred years," said Toprak, who is also a member of the CDU. "</seg>
<seg id="14">The chairman of the association called for the Federal Government to be "as sharp as Austria against Erdogan and his followers."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in Germany too, a" witch-hunt "takes place against Erdogan-critics."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the last few months, I do not feel safe in Germany for the first time."</seg>

<seg id="18">"more Turks will seek asylum in Germany, especially Kurds and Oppositionists."</seg>
<seg id="19">The branding as Gülen-followers destroys teachers and other academics the professional existence.</seg>
<seg id="20">"whoever does not fit and praises Erdogan sits on packed suitcases, by the way also the Kemalists and Säkulars," said Ercan Karakoyun, chairman of the Gülen Foundation Dialogue and Education, the "World." "</seg>
<seg id="21">"as reported by the newspaper on appeal to figures from the Federal Ministry of Interior, the Turks introduced the largest group of asylum seekers recognised for political persecution in Germany before the coup."</seg>

<seg id="2">Strange Mecklenburg-Vorpommern: the locals receive nothing from the summer campaign - and the holidaymakers from North Rhine-Westphalia are not allowed to choose the country's day.</seg>
<seg id="3">In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern they understood.</seg>
<seg id="4">"until 2021, the Parliament elections will not be held directly at the end of the summer holidays, the Schwerin Parliament has already decided at the beginning of the year."</seg>
<seg id="5">"for stupid as yet, it doesn't work: summer holidays, heat and landfill combat - that bites."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the locals, who are to be convinced of the electors, are on holiday."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most of the vacationers in the country, on Usedom, Rügen or Hiddensee, are not a local, so you can not choose the country day."</seg>
<seg id="8">"practical problems come: during the holidays, helpers who hang up posters, inflate balloons, distribute flyers and enumerate voices in the end are just laborious."</seg>
<seg id="9">"until 4 September 2016, the election and final holiday, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern must once again pass a campaign against the people over themselves."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the hot phase, if you can say it at all, has just begun."</seg>
<seg id="11">"and it's also about something: Prime Minister Erwin Sellering, leader of an SPD / CDU coalition, has to fear his office."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the SPD, the strongest party since 1998, is now in polls clearly behind the CDU."</seg>
<seg id="13">Exciting is how strongly Neuing AfD cuts off and what remains in the end coalitionable.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Sellering, 66 years old and since 2008 head of government, makes an almost inconspicuous election campaign, one can see from his large posters."</seg>
<seg id="15">"he travels through the country, distributes roses and chats a little with the people, just as he already did legendary predecessor Harald Ringstorff."</seg>
<seg id="16">"otherwise, sailors have got cold feet and chancellor Merkel will blame for the thriving of AfD."</seg>
<seg id="17">"their refugee policy, their" We create this "have hastened the rise of right-wing populists, which will probably cost him the beautiful office."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the CDU with its top candidate, the Minister of the Interior, Lorenz Caffier, has already experienced how it is when one makes election campaigns at the wrong time at the wrong time."</seg>
<seg id="19">She has invited Angela Merkel to big documents twice; Merkel's Bundestag election is in the north-east.</seg>
<seg id="20">"but the target group did not agree, there were more North Rhine-Westphalia, Berlin and Saxony as Mecklenburg and Vorpommern."</seg>
<seg id="21">"there was probably the majority of other federal states," "said Vincent Kokert, General Secretary of the CDU in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, recently in NDR."</seg>
<seg id="22">But it's too bad no one from other corners of Germany to listen to Angela Merkel.</seg>
<seg id="23">"otherwise, the Northeast CDU renounces the usual electoral campaign across marketplaces and in front of shopping malls with umbrellas and balloons."</seg>
<seg id="24">"so, cocaine says, plays only a" subordinate role. ""</seg>
<seg id="25">"the Union has also noted that in the country, it is crumbling away that it has to strain itself very much, to find a wire to the people again."</seg>
<seg id="26">"it is like the left, the SPD, the Greens: hardly exists in the wideness of the country."</seg>
<seg id="27">"the Council of the CDU electorist Kokert on his comrades is also self-exposing:" "they have to go where it hurts, namely where people are: Dorffeste, Golden weddings, every birthday party has to be used."</seg>
<seg id="28">"because a lot is in the game, Sellering has now called on his SPD to become a particularly engaged electoral campaign."</seg>
<seg id="29">"in polls, the Socialists and Democrats recently stood behind partner CDU (25) and just above the AfD (19)."</seg>
<seg id="30">"at the election 2011, the SPD still clearly won 35.6 percent before the CDU (22)."</seg>
<seg id="31">"the Green Party, a small party with seven percent in the polls, should make the leap into the land tag."</seg>
<seg id="32">They make a modern virtue out of vacation-need and transfer their campaign to the internet largely.</seg>
<seg id="33">"online election campaign," he calls the president of the country Claudia Müller. "</seg>

<seg id="1">B27 rehabilitation: restaurants suffer from blocking</seg>
<seg id="2">There is nothing to complain about the speed with which the B 27 is rehabilitated.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for those responsible for the construction work, which will start at 5.30am and end at 8 o'clock in the morning, there are plenty of praise."</seg>
<seg id="4">"they have done everything pretty shaky," "says Elvira Tetzlaff from the jet fuel station."</seg>
<seg id="5">This is a super team.</seg>
<seg id="6">There is no delay.</seg>
<seg id="7">"the construction site was to be relocated to the south at the beginning of the week, until the end of October everything should be ready."</seg>
<seg id="8">"also praised will be the receipt of those responsible for the construction works, for example when it comes to setting up residence intakes."</seg>
<seg id="9">"since the construction site has been migrated to the south on Monday and also the blocking of the Aspergomstraße in Ofterdingen has been lifted and thus the connection to Rottenburg is again, the traffic situation within the place has eased."</seg>
<seg id="10">The citizens can now travel from Ofterdingen to the B 27 on both sides.</seg>
<seg id="11">Evasive traffic through the place seems to go back.</seg>
<seg id="12">"there were some considerable complaints," says the head manager Florian King responsible for the management of the refurbishment. "</seg>
<seg id="13">"the residents of Bachelstrasse, Steinlachstraße, Hafner Street and Weiherrain had to fight with more traffic noise, because many sneers were looking for and more familiar with their navigation than the signage."</seg>
<seg id="14">What led to the fact that some trucks were franchised in residential areas.</seg>
<seg id="15">"as the speed limits were not complied with, the municipality increased the vehicle from Mössingen."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there were considerable transgressions," "says King, who informed himself on the spot himself."</seg>
<seg id="17">Two to three per minute have been scored.</seg>
<seg id="18">The quickest was on the road with 77 kilometres of hourly kilometres.</seg>
<seg id="19">"since the construction site has moved on, it has become calmer."</seg>
<seg id="20">For the businessmen at the B 27 it is only a little consolation that for customers from Rottenburg the road is now open again.</seg>
<seg id="21">Business people don't like to look into the cards.</seg>
<seg id="22">"however, the fact that the B 27 rehabilitation has led to revenue bursts for them leaves anyone looking to look through."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, some are more and less affected."</seg>
<seg id="24">"those who have less to do with the" "end customer" "are, therefore, produced for other companies, for whom the rehabilitation has hardly any consequences."</seg>
<seg id="25">"even at the dealership of Maier Thomas Sulz talks about a" "most moderate decline", "but also admits that" "course" "is missing."</seg>
<seg id="26">The most heavily exploited are the local spots along the road.</seg>
<seg id="27">"J.Albert Göhner, owner of Steakhouse, formerly Crown, finds clear words."</seg>
<seg id="28">This is already existential.</seg>
<seg id="29">"not only him, but all the restaurants" "hit hard". ""</seg>
<seg id="30">"customers were missing from Hechingen, Balingen and Rottweil."</seg>
<seg id="31">We have to be happy about every euro turnover.</seg>
<seg id="32">"at" "far more than 50 percent", "the sales revenue is reduced to" "more than 50 percent." ""</seg>
<seg id="33">"" "street renovation has dropped its operation" "by two years."</seg>
<seg id="34">He has to release half of his staff.</seg>
<seg id="35">"if I had a company with 4,000 employees and half would have been dismissed, politics would have responded differently."</seg>
<seg id="36">"instead, Prime Minister Jörg Schmidt has responded to a request by Göhner, whether there could be a financial compensation, the restaurant otherwise benefit from the advantages of the situation at the B 27."</seg>
<seg id="37">Göhner knows from other counties where something more generous is handled.</seg>
<seg id="38">"with all complaints, Göhner is confident that his restaurant will continue to exist."</seg>
<seg id="39">"after all, the family business has been settled here since 1715, but refers to the long history."</seg>
<seg id="40">"that other regulars now look less frequently due to complicated traffic guidance, he can understand."</seg>
<seg id="41">"if you cannot approach it, it is also somewhere else beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="42">"after the renovation work, Göhner has no doubts."</seg>
<seg id="43">"despite the crises with BSE and bird flu, Göhner holds the effects of the B 27 construction on his clientele for the biggest crisis that his restaurant has experienced in its long-standing history."</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the name of fighting terrorism, laws are constantly being routed."</seg>
<seg id="2">"following the latest proposals, Interior Minister de Maizière now presents a thick security package."</seg>
<seg id="3">But what has a tolerance status to do with terror?</seg>
<seg id="4">And what does the coalition partner say to all of this?</seg>
<seg id="5">Thomas de Maizière gives the Versatier.</seg>
<seg id="6">"all his proposals are politically reasonable to the coalition partner," says the Federal Minister of Interior in the presentation of his new security package. "</seg>
<seg id="7">They don't overwhelm anyone.</seg>
<seg id="8">"other, further points would initially be discussed within the parties."</seg>
<seg id="9">I also took part in this.</seg>
<seg id="10">"but as the Minister of the Interior, however, he was located on results and at a" "achievable consensus" "within the Coalition."</seg>
<seg id="11">"after the recent attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach, de Maizière has left a little time before he presents his conclusions for security in the Republic."</seg>
<seg id="12">But these are all the more extensive.</seg>
<seg id="13">"some things are already known, announced, announced: that a new security authority should take care of the cracking of encrypted communication is not new."</seg>
<seg id="14">Also not the fact that Germany needs to implement several EU directives on passenger data and truce rights.</seg>
<seg id="15">The call for more video surveillance and personnel for security authorities is not surprising.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in part, de Maizière starts a second attempt for proposals that have not yet been made with the SPD: he wants to raise sympathy for terrorist groups under penalty and knock jihadists with double citizenship to the German passport."</seg>
<seg id="17">"this will be difficult points for the SPD," the CDU admits. "</seg>
<seg id="18">"he nevertheless considers this to be reasonable and does not demand anything, which in the coalition partner doesn't have any chance anyway."</seg>
<seg id="19">De Maizière presented some new ideas too.</seg>
<seg id="20">They have partly in themselves: he plans quick methods for deportations and more possibilities for the incarceration of people before deportation.</seg>
<seg id="21">Refugees who are targeted at the country should check their smartphones and disclose social media accounts for a security audit.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in the case of tolerances for rejected asylum seekers, he wants to make some worse than until now - such as committing crimes or deliberately throwing their papers out in order to disguise their identity."</seg>
<seg id="23">Some of them are politically and legally sanctuaries.</seg>
<seg id="24">Some even seem unqualified and leaves questions unanswered.</seg>
<seg id="25">"and with some points - in the imbalance of tolerated ones, for example - the question arises: what has this actually to do with security and terror?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"yes, says de Maizière, it is important to differentiate between the topics of refugees and terror."</seg>
<seg id="27">But it cannot be argued that the attacks of Ansbach and Wuerzburg were refugees.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in addition, many people were worried about security in view of the high refugees."</seg>
<seg id="29">"and things that people deeply occupied, did not let themselves be clinging to election campaign times."</seg>
<seg id="30">The inner security has greatly moved into focus.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only the stops in the neighborhood: Paris, Copenhagen, Brussels, Nice."</seg>
<seg id="32">Then the attacks in Würzburg and Ansbach.</seg>
<seg id="33">The uncertainty is great.</seg>
<seg id="34">"and yes, there are electoral campaigns."</seg>
<seg id="35">"for this reason, the Union and the SPD are increasingly in their position on the subject of internal security."</seg>
<seg id="36">"in the past few days, there was a high level between the two parties."</seg>
<seg id="37">"only a tentative argument about the equipping of the Federal Police, then a security policy collection of some Unions interior ministers, in which the chiefs also demand a burst of burka and a renunciation of dual citizenship."</seg>
<seg id="38">De Maizière is also struggling here for conciliatory sounds.</seg>
<seg id="39">"from a return from the double pass, he doesn't consider anything."</seg>
<seg id="40">We have fixed the discussion in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="41">To recreate it is not useful.</seg>
<seg id="42">"and with a burka ban, he has constitutional concerns."</seg>
<seg id="43">Whether its own package is unconstitutional in all corners and whether it is actually "reasonable" for the coalition partner only has to show itself.</seg>
<seg id="44">"there's a lot in it, which could cause quarrels."</seg>
<seg id="45">But the SPD is also trying to proactively shape itself on the subject of internal security.</seg>
<seg id="46">"party leader Sigmar Gabriel only once again signals the willingness to talk and says:" "the SPD is ready to talk about everything, which contributes to further enhancing safety."</seg>

<seg id="1">Destination Plates: who actually buys vinyl records?</seg>
<seg id="2">Lonely men middle-aged love plates.</seg>
<seg id="3">"before you rush to the comments section to see him under the pseudonym Nonavenue men's middle age with rough insults, this statement is derived from current data."</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to YouGov, the much discussed resurrection of records is not limited to a boom in millennials that want to welcome the newness of physical objects, but to Midlife-nostalgia."</seg>
<seg id="5">Those who recently bought a record are all foresight after the age between 45 and 54.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in fact, the age group of 18-24 is the most unlikely buyer group."</seg>
<seg id="7">It is also not a horde through hobby collectors - it has an emotional meaning: older record buyers are more likely to retain their feelings (56% vs. 53%) and enjoy spending time alone (69% vs. 66%).</seg>
<seg id="8">But are the results of YouGov vote?</seg>
<seg id="9">"if this blog was a news report on TV, the camera would follow me while I run in Soho in the middle of a busy street, hold a modest gray suit before I steal, hold my hands and say something stupid like:" "so, let's take a closer look at it."</seg>
<seg id="10">"so, let's take a look at it."</seg>
<seg id="11">"even if the heart of Soho is slowly lost in its charm - hotels, restaurants and offices now fill the buildings in which independent vendors were located - there are still a handful of fantastic record specialty shops."</seg>
<seg id="12">I would probably ask the cameraman to turn off the camera for the next part in which I stand in close proximity to various men in such shops and try to assess their age and mind by observation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"Glasgow, 55, whom I follow from Sister Ray (number of data: two young women, three middle-aged men) into Reckless Records (number of numbers: eight men middle-aged, a woman, probably around 20), is one day long because of a meeting in London and goes through the shops to fill the couple of hours."</seg>
<seg id="14">"is he a collector, I ask?"</seg>
<seg id="15">"I guess," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="16">"I have about 3,000 or 4,000 disks."</seg>
<seg id="17">"these records, pictured above (he sent me the snapshot by e-mail, I did not follow him home), clothe the walls of his living room."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the reason why he has such a considerable number of albums and singles is the result of his available income: he is now able to buy records he could not afford, when they appeared and bought items he sold when he was young and broke."</seg>
<seg id="19">"many things I buy are from the late 60s, early 70s, which appeared when I was 11 or 12. things I probably have been a little too young to buy them," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="20">"he agrees that those who buy records are rather introverted and gladly spend time alone, and adds:" I don't smoke and I don't drink a lot. "</seg>
<seg id="21">This is my vice.</seg>
<seg id="22">"WEZ, 25, who works at Sister Ray, also believes that many customers, whom he meets, apply to the YouGov profile."</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, he also noticed a new wave of people influenced by the media, people who heard about the comeback and are prompted to buy their old records."</seg>
<seg id="24">"from the conversations that I have led, people usually get rid of their collection by 1998 or 1999."</seg>
<seg id="25">"customers who once sold their records to buy CDs now sell their CDs to buy their records," he says. "</seg>
<seg id="26">This would explain the boom of supporters of the record revivals of a certain age.</seg>
<seg id="27">But what about the alleged emotional meaning of records?</seg>
<seg id="28">"it takes just a few seconds in a shop like Phonica, to see that record business offers a calming community of like-minded people."</seg>
<seg id="29">"according to Wez, some of the older customers contacted the contactless payment system."</seg>
<seg id="30">"some record fans feel overwhelmed by the digital world and want to withdraw themselves to the stability of familiar record sleeves, from items that evoke happy memories."</seg>
<seg id="31">"I think, sometimes it can be the filling of a void or possession of material possessions as a kind of comfort," says Wez. "</seg>
<seg id="32">This is the case with me as a collector and I think that it is so with many people.</seg>
<seg id="33">It is a simple way to deal mentally.</seg>
<seg id="34">"" "we are like their social workers!" "an employee dies off a record pile."</seg>
<seg id="35">"a poll of the ICM in April revealed that almost 50% of the people who bought a record last month, did not yet listen to it."</seg>
<seg id="36">"the survey also found that 41% have a record player they never use, whereas 7% of those who buy a record don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="37">"at this time of the news report, I would probably look very worried as I browse through a stack of Bossa Nova compilations."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Jonny, 42, who works at Sounds of the Universe (Number of Number: three men middle-aged) has noticed a" "trophy aspect" "of the Revival."</seg>
<seg id="39">"someone just came here and said," I don't own a record player, but I'd like to buy a Radiohead Record, so that I can put it on the shelf, "he says."</seg>
<seg id="40">"this is not a big percentage, but it definitely happens."</seg>
<seg id="41">"more productless, less playing music."</seg>
<seg id="42">We have people saying: "I don't have a record player."</seg>
<seg id="43">"these are younger people, not older ones who only enter slowly."</seg>
<seg id="44">"Fopp, which has dedicated the records to almost a whole floor, has a colorful audience when I go in."</seg>
<seg id="45">"there are couples around 70, tourists who make photos, teenagers and middle-aged women."</seg>
<seg id="46">Even if the atmosphere is somewhat less relaxed than in the above-mentioned shops - Wild Beasts's latest synthesizer- and sexipacked pop instead of experimental jazz moans from the loudspeakers - it is good to see such diversity among the customers.</seg>
<seg id="47">"none of them looks very lonely, but nagging psychic trauma is hard to detect if you stand next to someone for 30 seconds."</seg>
<seg id="48">"Elanora, 27, has been running around the business for a few minutes and considers the variety of plates available for sale."</seg>
<seg id="49">She rather makes a shop window than a big shopping.</seg>
<seg id="50">"it doesn't deserve much, so collecting records is not a real option, she says."</seg>
<seg id="51">It costs a lot.</seg>
<seg id="52">"it is easy to listen to music from a computer or in other ways, but the beauty of plates is..." "she drives off with a dearest sigh."</seg>
<seg id="53">I don't know how to explain it - it's really unique.</seg>
<seg id="54">My last stop is a business that is said to have inspired a new generation of disk lovers: urban Outfitters.</seg>
<seg id="55">"while I give the appearance of mustering the jeans hotpants, I watch a group of young girls, who are grouped for a moment to group Polaroid cameras before a father and his daughter are considering buying a Crosley record player."</seg>
<seg id="56">"on the left there is a staircase, a wall full of plates of Adele, Jeff Buckley, Amy Winehouse and Fleetwood Mac: a mixture of contemporary music and classics, the essential plates for an average collection."</seg>
<seg id="57">"no one looks at them - perhaps because they are only purely decorative, some so far above that it is impossible to touch them."</seg>
<seg id="58">It is pure "record art."</seg>
<seg id="59">"but considering that every attraction for these items means more money for the industry and some customers could send in the depths of Soho for more, there is nothing to complain about."</seg>
<seg id="60">"it is no surprise that a population group, who has more time and money than others, is also the one who spends most of the luxury items like plates."</seg>
<seg id="61">"even though my research revealed that the results of YouGov vote, they are ignored, at least in record stores in Soho, the large number of female collectors who exist in reality, record shops and online forums."</seg>
<seg id="62">These people are probably working hard at school or in offices.</seg>
<seg id="63">"they spend their Thursday morning with security not with the bumblebees on the Berwick Street and the sheets through plates, while they steer clear of an uncanny, 30-year-old false presenter who unravels over the shoulders of nothing of middle-aged men."</seg>

<seg id="2">"a French court has rejected an offer of the authorities in Calais, dozens of provisional shops and restaurants in the jungle of Calais where thousands of refugees live."</seg>
<seg id="3">"during a trial this week, the authorities in Calais argued that the state should be authorised to sell 72 temporary shops in which people within the camp sell goods, from cigarettes to ergydrinks, sell, hairdressing services or sell tea for 50 cents (40 pence) or simple meals for a few euros in temporary restaurants."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the fecfecture of Calais argued that these places should be torn down, because they would represent a parallel economy, from which no taxes would be paid and which contain fire and sanitation risks."</seg>
<seg id="5">"humanitarian groups told the court that the shops and restaurants were important, as the free meals offered by the state-supported unification and other groups would not offer enough food for the growing numbers in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="6">They also stated that the temporary shops and restaurants would often offer accommodation and free meals for people in need.</seg>
<seg id="7">"a court in Lille decided that there would be no legal basis for the expulsion of people who operate the 72 temporary shops, but admitted that the concerns of the Prefecture of Calais were absolutely incomprehensible."</seg>
<seg id="8">"judge Jean-François Molla said that grocery stores, cafes and restaurants would play a much greater role than merely nourishing people living in extremely precarious conditions."</seg>
<seg id="9">He said that the areas offer quiet meeting points between refugees and volunteers.</seg>
<seg id="10">"one of the places that was threatened by the rain was the Jungle Book Kids' Café of the camp, which is operated in the community and offers 200 meals a day, English and French classes as well as advice on asylum cases for the hundreds of needy, unaccompanied minors in the camp."</seg>
<seg id="11">More than 170.000 people signed the petition to preserve the Kids' Café.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in a letter to the Guardian it was said that" "closing" "would be a disaster for these children, of which the youngest eight years are old."</seg>
<seg id="13">"the two aid organizations Help Refugees and L'Auberge des Migrants estimated that the number of people living in the jungle camp has increased to more than 9,000 people - the highest number until now - following a steep increase of newcomers during the summer."</seg>

<seg id="2">Britain's impressive performance in the 7-year rugby led to an abrupt halt in the last hurdle in the form of Fijis when they were defeated in Rio with a result of 43-7 at the deodoro Stadium.</seg>

<seg id="4">"the echo of the Trainers Robin Williams, was allready when they rowed for the second Olympiagold in two without a tax woman, the first women in the history of British Sports who set such a standard."</seg>
<seg id="5">"their dominance was absolutely, after all their 39.ter unused deployment, which is also unprecedented."</seg>
<seg id="6">"what we see are two brilliant female athletes, who glide over the surface with the elegance of swans, which does not reflect the style of the triumphal."</seg>
<seg id="7">"behind each gold in rowing there is a battalion of willing helpers who contribute to the incremental advances that make the difference, and no one was much easier than the coach who did not know whether he would survive this day when he was diagnosed with cancer."</seg>
<seg id="8">"as he said, he risked."</seg>
<seg id="9">"I had bladder cancer, which is operable and they did."</seg>
<seg id="10">"if you do not do that, he spreads everywhere."</seg>
<seg id="11">It would have been a pretty terrible situation.</seg>
<seg id="12">It changes a bit of the view.</seg>
<seg id="13">Williams was diagnosed in December 2013.</seg>
<seg id="14">"the trio was lucky that he could begin treatment at the beginning of 2014, outside the season, which kept the interruption to a minimum if that is the right term in such circumstances."</seg>
<seg id="15">"I needed money, so I had to go better soon."</seg>
<seg id="16">It was an incentive.</seg>
<seg id="17">"I was hospitalized and ran around the station - 20 feet, 30 feet, 50 feet at a time when they said that some steps would suffice."</seg>
<seg id="18">That is how it begins.</seg>
<seg id="19">"the rowing in itself is a challenge, but that makes it an even bigger one."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the immediacy of victory, their first thoughts went to Williams, who spent a nerve wreaking morning doing something more than usual, trying to process his own fears."</seg>
<seg id="21">"panning, who was the captain of the Royal Artillery Regiment in a deployment in Afghanistan, said," "I was an emotional wreck this week. it's a bit extreme, but it means so much."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it just repeats how much I mean, how much I and Helen and Robin have worked."</seg>
<seg id="23">There were three fantastic years with Helen and Robin.</seg>
<seg id="24">"without Robin we would be no one, so a massive thank you to him. he is the best trainer in the world."</seg>
<seg id="25">I couldn't have wished for a better person for training or a better trainer.</seg>
<seg id="26">Helena Glover and Heather Stanning have not lost a race over the last five years.</seg>
<seg id="27">The couple had a tough rhythm with which their opponents couldn't keep up.</seg>
<seg id="28">"even in the last 500 meters, when the teams from New Zealand and Denmark began to catch up, Stanning and Glover had too much in reserve."</seg>
<seg id="29">We were caught very at the moment.</seg>
<seg id="30">"Helen called" "stay in the process, stay in the process." ""</seg>
<seg id="31">It is really important not to let yourself be carried away.</seg>
<seg id="32">We had a good start and at the same time we were not prepared to do something great.</seg>
<seg id="33">"we didn't want a fireworks today, we just wanted to get a good result, go out and win the race, which we did."</seg>
<seg id="34">The couple will take a break for one year before making decisions about his future.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Glover must appear next week on a wedding, their own with the TV adventurer Steve Backshall."</seg>

<seg id="2">The crisis-torn and energy-intensive German steel industry is spared from additional costs in the millions.</seg>
<seg id="3">"financial burdens, which the branch from the green economy threatened, are from the table."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it remains in the release of the Renewable Energy Regulations in the existing plants for so-called self-power production in the German steel industry, said Federal Minister for Economic Affairs, Sigmar Gabriel (SPD) of the" Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung "(WAZ, Friday issue)."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am really happy that we could finally reach the negotiations after two years of tough negotiations.</seg>
<seg id="6">"the European Commission, therefore, initially planned to ask steel manufacturers that use gases from the blast furnace for electricity generation for their own consumption."</seg>
<seg id="7">"according to the German industry association, the steel industry has threatened an additional cost of 120 to 240 million euros per year."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Gabriel said the WAZ, there is now a basic agreement with the European Commission for talks with competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager."</seg>
<seg id="9">"only once the generators in the steel works are replaced, an EEG levy of 20 percent."</seg>
<seg id="10">But this also does not rise in the steel industry.</seg>
<seg id="11">IG Metall welcomed Germany's agreement with the European Commission on its own electricity generation.</seg>
<seg id="12">"in this way, the status quo of the current regulation is largely determined."</seg>
<seg id="13">The successful effort made by Gabriel for the steel industry is of particular importance.</seg>
<seg id="14">"with regard to our" steel is future, "this is a first step."</seg>
<seg id="15">"more must follow."</seg>
<seg id="16">"even in the case of reforming the issue of emissions legislation, climate and employment objectives are to be weighed," stated IG Metall-Chief Jörg Hofmann in Frankfurt. "</seg>
<seg id="17">The steel industry in Europe has been suffering from overcapacity and considerable price pressure since the financial crisis in 2008.</seg>
<seg id="18">"last year, the situation was aggravated when the world's largest producer of producers cast steel on the world market in view of the weaker domestic demand."</seg>
<seg id="19">European manufacturers are throwing price dumping in Chinese steel corporations.</seg>
<seg id="20">"in the course of this spring, the situation has somewhat relaxed."</seg>
<seg id="21">"on the one hand, imposed import duties on import steel effects, on the other hand, the economic prospects in China have brightened up."</seg>
<seg id="22">It is unclear how sustainable the price recovery is.</seg>
<seg id="23">The German industry primus Thyssenkrupp was cautious on Thursday.</seg>
<seg id="24">"last but not least, prices would have stagnated again."</seg>
<seg id="25">The industry responds to the difficult situation with further cost reductions.</seg>
<seg id="26">"last but not least, ThyssenKrupp did not want to exclude the closure of individual works."</seg>
<seg id="27">Around 86000 people were employed in the German steel industry at the end of 2015.</seg>
<seg id="28">"in July, despite rising prices and increasing orders, German steel manufacturers are cautious."</seg>
<seg id="29">"with 3.4 million tonnes, they produced a good six percent lower crude steel than in the previous year's month, as the economic unification of steel reported on Friday."</seg>
<seg id="30">"after a short increase in May, the produced quantity went back the second month in a row."</seg>

<seg id="1">"community, spirit, health: singing does seniors good"</seg>
<seg id="2">"singing has accompanied Ursel Kipp her whole life: as a young girl she was in the school choir, she studied music and today the 78-year-old sings in a seniors-choir."</seg>
<seg id="3">"sing moves me - emotionally and physically," she describes. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"after a rehearsal, she feels balanced, cheerful and a total livelier, she says."</seg>
<seg id="5">"by the way, she does something good for her health and her mind."</seg>
<seg id="6">"Singen is from several perspectives a great hobby for seniors, says Erhard Hackler of the Deutsche Seniorenliga."</seg>
<seg id="7">"most seniors sing in the choir and share with like-minded people the joy of music, describes Hacklers."</seg>
<seg id="8">Regular interaction enables seniors to socialize and maintain social contacts.</seg>
<seg id="9">"often social and family structures dissolve in old age, a choir is then an ideal opportunity to spend time with other people."</seg>
<seg id="10">"this experience also made Ursel Kipp in her choir:" "to speak and organise, to be able to rely on others and to learn from each other - a choir is a very special form of being together."</seg>
<seg id="11">"singing can be strenuous in the positive sense, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="12">For thereby seniors train a deep and controlled breathing.</seg>
<seg id="13">Those who regularly demand their lungs are not so fast in everyday life as quickly as possible.</seg>
<seg id="14">"even when it comes to maintaining the sound of the voice at old age, singing is an ideal hobby."</seg>
<seg id="15">"on older people, singing often has a very special effect, says Ursula Lenz from the German Federal Association of Senior Citizens."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the older generations, joint singing had a much higher significance, it belonged to everyday life, both in school and leisure, she explains."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Lenz often observed that singing or listening to songs in older people arouses a lot of memories, often associated with positive feelings of their youth."</seg>
<seg id="18">Lyrics and especially melodies devote themselves to long-lying events themselves.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in singing, the head is also required to perform a special performance, explains Lenz."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, focus on one's own voice and on a given rhythm and adapt to the other singers - this is a great cognitive challenge."</seg>
<seg id="21">"just elderly people, who live alone, do not only practice concentrating on themselves."</seg>
<seg id="22">"another positive aspect is the recognition obtained through singing in the choir, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="23">An enthusiastic audience is a great praise.</seg>
<seg id="24">The self-esteem also grows through singing in the choir.</seg>
<seg id="25">"to show oneself: if I have been for something for a long time, I will be better and waver over me - this experience strengthens."</seg>
<seg id="26">"good reasons to start singing, there is enough."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if you want to try out a new hobby, you should not hesitate - even if you think you have little talent, Lenz recommends."</seg>
<seg id="28">"you don't sing alone - with 50 singing people, who sounds there when a sound goes wrong?"</seg>
<seg id="29">"in search of the right offer, senior citizens have different options, says Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="30">"if someone is singing from the circle of acquaintances in a senior choir, one can easily join."</seg>
<seg id="31">Many cities also offer overviews of the choirs in the surrounding area.</seg>
<seg id="32">Those who want to sing in a church choir can turn directly to the church or the church leader.</seg>
<seg id="33">Many seniors can also be found via the Internet.</seg>
<seg id="34">"if you don't have access to the Internet, the family, friends or neighbors can ask for help with the internet search."</seg>
<seg id="35">"those who want to sing, should necessarily join a choir, advises Hackler."</seg>
<seg id="36">Singing does the soul sing well and has something liberating - that applies to all ages.</seg>

<seg id="8">She is the author of the study published this Friday in the journal "BMC Evolutionary Biology."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in a previous examination, the research team had already discovered that the duration and pitch of the kittens were different with the urgency of their dependency."</seg>
<seg id="10">Nine adult males and eight female bibs were observed from the animal husbandry of MHH.</seg>
<seg id="11">"they were played for a row of little ones, taken out of the throwing box for three minutes and separated from the mother and siblings."</seg>
<seg id="12">"on the other hand, they were confronted with screams of stronger excited kittens, which were raised in addition."</seg>
<seg id="13">The researchers keep their results conclusive despite the low sample.</seg>
<seg id="14">"all females, even those who had not had their own offspring, reacted to the screams," "said Konerding."</seg>
<seg id="15">They turned faster to the loudspeakers when the sound of the very sublime kittens played.</seg>
<seg id="16">This ability may be innate or develop with the sexually mature.</seg>
<seg id="17">"a surprise was that the males have reacted at all," "said the biologist."</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the past, scientists have already repeatedly examined the reactions of women and men on baby noises."</seg>

<seg id="16">"the bomb attacks carry the same signature," said Army General Danai Kritmethavee Friday morning before journalists. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We assume that this is a coordinated attack.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it is too early to express themselves to possible motives, but it is probably a matter of the deeds of Muslim rebels."</seg>
<seg id="19">Thai media also wanted to see a pattern typical of the bombings of Muslim separatists in the south of the country.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the Thai police, on the other hand, declared that the attacks were not in connection with the Islamist revolt or with international terrorism."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is only local sabotage, limited to limited areas and provinces," said a speaker in Bangkok. "</seg>
<seg id="22">"rather, it is assumed that the bombs of opponents of the ruling military junta were laid."</seg>
<seg id="23">"in recent days, the authorities have kept secret warnings about upcoming attacks in the south of the country - but they were not informed about the exact time and places."</seg>
<seg id="24">"still, it is unclear which group is behind the attacks."</seg>

<seg id="31">Increased security risk (security level 2) applies to the rest of the country.</seg>
<seg id="32">The attacks on Thursday and Friday were followed a few days after a controversial referendum on a constitution drafted by the military junta.</seg>
<seg id="33">This gives the military great influence over the coming years.</seg>
<seg id="34">"Junta boss and Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha said that the bombs were an attempt to create chaos while the country moves towards stability, an improvement in the economic situation and tourism."</seg>

<seg id="2">Not always the Olympians or world records determine the headlines at the Olympic Games.</seg>
<seg id="3">This shows the bold appearance of Robel Kiros Habte during the summer games in Rio de Janeiro.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in the Aquatics Center, the slightly overweight swimmers from Ethiopia slowly swam so slowly that he was no longer able to see in the TV pictures at times."</seg>
<seg id="5">It simply disappeared - no matter how far the cutout was chosen.</seg>
<seg id="6">"in social networks, Habte was subsequently transformed into an internethite."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in fact, the 24-year-old ended up with a gap of 48 seconds and reserved the 59th place of 59 starters."</seg>
<seg id="8">But it was rather his not just sporting figure that drew attention from the international media.</seg>
<seg id="9">Why the 24-year-old still participates in the Olympics?</seg>
<seg id="10">The Ethiopian got a special start right from the international swimming association.</seg>
<seg id="11">This is distributed to make swimming in underrepresented countries known.</seg>
<seg id="12">"since most athletes are running in Ethiopia, I just wanted to do something else."</seg>
<seg id="13">Preparation is all: ROBEL Kiros Habte is ready for the big race.</seg>
<seg id="14">Quickly the first nicknames made the round.</seg>
<seg id="15">Some media referred to him as the "robel of the whale."</seg>
<seg id="16">"in accordance with a" "prosperity" "the English tabloid" "The Sun" "was funny with" "Dad Bod" "about him."</seg>
<seg id="17">"his time, he first hit the 100-meter-freestyle with a minute and almost five seconds, played no part."</seg>
<seg id="18">Comparisons with "Eric the Eel" have also been drawn.</seg>
<seg id="19">"at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney, Eric Moussbani took care of media attention."</seg>
<seg id="20">"unforgettable was the appearance of the swimmers from Equatorial Guinea, when he had to compete over 100 metres of free-style in a suburb."</seg>
<seg id="21">Frenetically Moussebani was fired at that time.</seg>
<seg id="22">The then 22-year-old learned to swim 8 months before the Olympic and had never completed such a long distance before the competition.</seg>

<seg id="1">"from October 1, 2016, the fees per cubic metre of waste water will be 3.44 instead of 2.10 euros; for Zultenberg / Lindenberg / Lopp 3,36 Euro (previously 2.26 Euro) and for Azendorf 3,64 Euro (previously 2.18 euros)."</seg>
<seg id="2">"at the plant in Azendorf, the wastewater fee will increase again at the latest when appropriate improvement measures are necessary."</seg>
<seg id="3">"after an overnight calculation, the sewage price in Azendorf will then be at 4.37 euros per cubic meter."</seg>
<seg id="4">"as mayor Bernd Steinhäuser (CSU) reported, the approval of the budget by the Kulmbach District Office noted that under covers for these wastewater facilities."</seg>
<seg id="5">"based on legal principles, the Kasendorf market is obliged to operate the systems cost-effective."</seg>
<seg id="6">"as of October 1, 2016, citizens as well as industrial and industrial companies from Welsh, Neudorf, Reuth, Azendorf, Lopp, Lindenberg and Zultenberg will have to reach deeper into the purse."</seg>
<seg id="7">The fee increases are between 48 and 67 percent.</seg>
<seg id="8">"as Chairman of the Board of Management, Herbert Schmidt displayed the committee, a re-calculation of the fees for the wastewater facilities of the market community was necessary."</seg>
<seg id="9">"in the period from October 2016 to September 2020, over- or undercover from the preceding period of calculation may also be equalized."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the grave fee increases were based on the fact that all three wastewater facilities have relatively small facilities with a very low waste water shortage, which is between 6800 and 12000 cubic meters per year."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, expenses for necessary repairs of several thousand euros would have a serious impact on the basis of the low distribution basis for example."</seg>
<seg id="12">"in addition, the sewage treatment in all three plants is slightly declining."</seg>
<seg id="13">"furthermore, in the past period of the calisation period, all three plants were not least due to their age of refurbishment and repair expenses in a considerable extent."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the plant in Azendorf is almost 30 years old, the plants for Welshahl, Neudorf and Reuth as well as Zultenberg, Lindenberg and Lopp almost 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="15">Schmidt pointed out that the mechanical ventilation system had to be replaced on the basis of a damage in the sewage plant of Azendorf.</seg>
<seg id="16">"in the pumping station Welshahl, the nearly 20 years old conveying systems had to be overhauled from the ground and at the pond table Lopp had to be disposed of after nearly 20 years of operation, the sewage sludge disposes and an additional ventilation facility to be installed in the future."</seg>
<seg id="17">"Schmidt:" "these extraordinary expenses came with the continued support and maintenance costs that must be taken into account in the new calculation period."</seg>
<seg id="18">"the same applies to electricity costs, which were still clearly below the current level during the previous calculations in 2011 / 2012."</seg>
<seg id="19">"stone houses made it clear that in the case of low waste water in the three plants, the expenses for operation and maintenance were full."</seg>
<seg id="20">"as a result, Schmidt, the market community of large entertainment costs, has remained spared in the wastewater facilities over the past 20 years."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the situation for the mentioned facilities will continue to be precarious in the view of stone houses in the long run, especially as one can not extend the supply area of the Friesenbachtal sewerage association in order to not extend these facilities because it is concerned with deficient facilities."</seg>

<seg id="2">"Snapchat states that this filter is anime-inspired, but some observers say it is insensitive to races."</seg>

<seg id="4">"you can turn into a pineapple, a dog or a figure out of a Roy Lichtenstein painting."</seg>
<seg id="5">"the filters are non-bloated, standalone rotating tools that generate more than 30 million vicious selfies per day."</seg>
<seg id="6">All miscarriages arrive at the public.</seg>
<seg id="7">"snapchat filters have critics in the past, in which they were accused that the app would promote blackface conveying or white skin as a beauty ideal."</seg>
<seg id="8">"when this week gave some users a filter that gave them slit eyes, false teeth and dark cheeks, some critics called a racist caricature from Asians -" yellow face. ""</seg>
<seg id="9">They asked themselves if these repeated controversy were pointing to a bigger problem that the company has diversity.</seg>
<seg id="10">"news and outrage were widespread on Wednesday, with reports from The Verge and Motherboard, a day after Snapchat reported that it would have disabled the feature."</seg>
<seg id="11">The company offered an apology: the filter was thought to be an homage to anime characters and not as caricature of Asians.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but outsiders, who experienced racism, reminded the filter of hurtful clichés."</seg>

<seg id="21">"on Thursday, Zhu, who works as a product manager and engineer for medium, decided to delete her Snapchat account, asked others to do the same."</seg>

<seg id="2">"military personnel of the United States Central Command changed intelligence in order to draw an optimistic picture of the war against the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, when it allowed the actual conditions on the ground to report a report on Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="3">"preliminary Report, created by a Task Force of Republican members of the Armed Forces of Armed Forces, Intelligence Committees and the Arms Control Committee, reports of great dissatisfaction among Central Command Secret Service analysts who reported how superiors changed their assessments to the American efforts in the fight against the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="4">"the Central Command, shortly Cencom, is the military headquarters in Tampa, Florida which controls the American military operations in the Middle East and Central Asia."</seg>
<seg id="5">"intelligence services rendered by high-level Centcom Commanders typically drew a positive picture of the American efforts against terrorism as it allowed the actual conditions on site, and were consistently positive as analysis of other intelligence services," a newspaper article quoted the report. "</seg>
<seg id="6">"what happened at Centcom is unacceptable - our soldiers suffer if bad analyses are presented to our political leaders," "said Ken Calvert, Republican member of the House of Representatives."</seg>
<seg id="7">The managerial errors in the Centcom go up to the top of the organization.</seg>
<seg id="8">The ten-page report presents detailed problems in the years 2014 and 2015 in the descriptions and analyses of the American efforts in the training of Iraqi forces.</seg>
<seg id="9">"although there is no direct evidence that government leaders under Obama have given instructions to change reports, it shows how analysts have faced pressure from their superiors, an optimistic picture of the threat of the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL."</seg>
<seg id="10">"during the first half of 2015, many Central Command press releases, statements and statements before the congress were clearly more positive than the facts" stated the report. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"for example, CentCom has publicly known that a military reconquest of Mossuls could already begin in April or May 2015."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Mosul, the second largest city in Iraq, remains under the control of the Islamic State."</seg>
<seg id="13">"after months of investigation, so much is clear." said Mike Pompeo, Republican Congressman from Kansas, in a statement. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"from the middle of 2014 to the middle of 2015, the leaders of the Central Command changed the intelligence reports to play down the threat of ISIS in Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="15">The Republicans called the Task Force in life after being played that analysts were worried about the manipulation of reports to the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the report published on Thursday will be completed by more detailed insights, while the investigation will continue."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in addition, further investigations of the Centcom reports are underway through the Chief Inspector of the Department of Defense."</seg>
<seg id="18">Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee published their own findings on Thursday that coincided with some of the conclusions of the Republican Task Force.</seg>
<seg id="19">"in 2014 and 2015, CentCom created an overly limited process for the creation of intelligence assessments for ISIL and Iraqi security services," "announced the high-ranking demokrat in the committee, member of the House of Representatives Adam B. Schiff, in an opinion."</seg>
<seg id="20">"this process, as Mr. Schiff," delayed the publication of intelligence reports, "Damaged morality under analysts and" gave too little room for diverging opinions. "</seg>
<seg id="21">But Mr. Schiff and the Democrats gave no indication of intervention of the White House at CentCom analysts regarding a "definite political opinion."</seg>
<seg id="22">The preliminary results of the conference were published on Tuesday by The Daily Beast.</seg>
<seg id="23">"last August, the New York Times reported an investigation by the Pentagon general inspector, who were admitted to CentCom analyst complaints."</seg>
<seg id="24">"Cmdr. Patrick Evans, a spokesman of the Pentagon, announced in a statement that the Ministry of Defence would not comment on Congress, while the investigation of the general inspector was still underway."</seg>
<seg id="25">"but he also admitted that" experts sometimes have quite diverging opinions on interpretation of complex data, and that the intelligence services and the ministry of defense welcome a controversial discussion of these important issues of national defence. "</seg>
<seg id="26">The investigations have repercussions on the question of a successful air campaign under American leadership in Iraq and Syria (an assertion that is now being made by a growing number of members of the Ministry of Defense).</seg>
<seg id="27">"however, last year's accusations have raised the question of how President Obama can rely on the Central Command to evaluate military operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other crisis regions."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the criticism of the secret information about the Islamic State is reminiscent of the interdependence of more than ten years ago when a Centcom analyst, Gregory Hooker, wrote a writing about how the then government under George W. Bush foresaw only a small occupation force in Iraq and had little time to think about the consequences of the invasion of 2003."</seg>
<seg id="29">Mr. Hooker also played a key role in the uprising against the current reporting of the Islamic State.</seg>
<seg id="30">"last year, the team led by Mr. Hooker after stating that government agencies had no significant impact on the terrorist group's financial situation, since these temporary refineries would have put up oil on the black market."</seg>
<seg id="31">"this recognition, however, was not published, the Times reported in September."</seg>
<seg id="32">"Centcoms damn commander, Gen. Lloyd J. Austin III, was criticised by members of the Legislative for his excessive positive appraisal of the war situation at a hearing before the Senate."</seg>

<seg id="4">"" "I have no idea." "she said."</seg>
<seg id="5">I am not one of the people who keep their goals in mind.</seg>
<seg id="6">"however, she knows that the Americans are at 4-0 in the Olympic competition and are equally in their group with the Britons in the first place, who remain unbeaten after their 2-0 victory against Japan."</seg>
<seg id="7">Britain and the United States will meet on Saturday in the final game of the first round.</seg>
<seg id="8">"both teams have already qualified for the quarter-finals, the game will decide which of the two teams will win the first and second place within their group of six teams."</seg>
<seg id="9">The first placed will take a bit longer for the strong Dutch to lead the other group.</seg>
<seg id="10">"as always the game may go out on Saturday, the Americans have triggered a surprising whirlwind through their success story, four years after they landed on the last of 12 seats at the last London Games."</seg>
<seg id="11">BAM was part of this team.</seg>
<seg id="12">"she grew up in Blue Bell, Pennsylvania, and had the first time with three years a hockey rider in hands (her two older sisters played the sport at the Drexel University), with 16 years she became national player of the USA, the youngest in the history of the team."</seg>
<seg id="13">"she missed the Olympics in 2008, because she could not qualify for the cadre."</seg>
<seg id="14">Then came the year 2012 in which everything went wrong for her and her team.</seg>
<seg id="15">"in the following year Craig Parnham, an Englishman, trainer of the national team and thus began to turn things better."</seg>
<seg id="16">"a change of culture, a mental change and a physical change," Bam said. "</seg>
<seg id="17">We did not have the workload in London that we now have.</seg>
<seg id="18">We have been able to rop the rudder completely.</seg>
<seg id="19">On Thursday evening Bam opened the Torreigen in the first half of the game with a backstop from the close-up area.</seg>
<seg id="20">"India had gone to the game without winning the tournament, but the team was surprisingly tough and held the score from 1-0 to the third quarter until Bam took the game into their hands."</seg>
<seg id="21">"she performed a sprint with the flat ball over the left flank, then moved to the center and knocked the ball into the gate to give the Americans a 2-0 guide."</seg>
<seg id="22">Melissa Gonzalez made the final gate in the middle of the last quarter.</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Shutout was the first of all the tournament for the keeper of the USA, Jackie Briggs, who previously had to book a gate in each of the previous games."</seg>
<seg id="24">She has a run.</seg>
<seg id="25">Just like Bam.</seg>
<seg id="26">"we are in a good position" said Parnham, but how well will depend on the outcome of the next game on Saturday. "</seg>

<seg id="1">"in the midst of the age of the Olympic Games, the Zen of the trampoline"</seg>
<seg id="2">"wherever you are, how late it is, it is the Olympic Games."</seg>
<seg id="3">"the events in Rio de Janeiro are feeling steady and unavoidable, a furious relay race between competition and aspiration."</seg>
<seg id="4">"it is as if the Olympic torch itself is a burning staff, which is handed down from the wristwatch to the swimmers to the triathletes."</seg>
<seg id="5">"you can't turn on the TV, read a newspaper or listen to the conversation of your neighbour in the coffee shop without hearing Simone Biles, Katie Ledecky or the dispute between Michael Phelps and Chad le Clos."</seg>
<seg id="6">And then there is Logan Dooley.</seg>
<seg id="7">"Dooley, who for the first time in the Olympic Games and a women's black with dimples, could have been among those familiar names sent to Prime Time, built by sponsors and feel-TV advertising when he was a swimmers, gymnast or even fisher."</seg>
<seg id="8">"but Dooley, 28, from Lake Forest, California, fights for gold in the Olympic trampolines."</seg>
<seg id="9">The Olympic flame does not illuminate every event.</seg>
<seg id="10">"further from the centre, partly in the shade are the sports that are not universally recognised: air pistol shooting, archery, badminton, Taekwondo."</seg>
<seg id="11">We will always have the breaststroke and may it rule for a long time.</seg>
<seg id="12">"but if I should make a modest argument for my particular favourite, then let me draw attention to the discreet charm of the trampoline."</seg>
<seg id="13">"although the trampoline jumping has been an Olympic event since 2000, when it had its debut in Sydney, it became so sparsely perceived for the last 16 years that many people I asked, did not know that it is at all an Olympic sport."</seg>
<seg id="14">This could also be regional ignorance.</seg>
<seg id="15">"although the USA sent athletes to competition, there has never been a medal in jumping on the trampoline and had until 2012 had an athlete who made it to the final round."</seg>
<seg id="16">The Chinese and the Russians tend to share the prices for the men and the Chinese and the Canadians for the women.</seg>
<seg id="17">Dong Dong from China and Rosie MacLennan from Canada will defend their gold medal from London this year.</seg>
<seg id="18">"jumping on the trampoline has some outside charme, partly because it is suitable for the unsecured ear for a clownsschool that sounds for the Olympics."</seg>
<seg id="19">"at this point, I should admit that I am not an expert, but only an earthbound enthusiast."</seg>
<seg id="20">"it has humoristic potential - the cartoonous trembling of his never-ending bouncing - but also the grazie of gymnastics and diving, which combines two types of sports that it combines essentially."</seg>
<seg id="21">"the word" "trampoline" "comes from the Spanish El Trampoline, which means as much as" springboard. ""</seg>
<seg id="22">"aspiring victors jump on a gigantic trampoline, shoot almost up to 30 feet in the air and need a number of falling movements (turning, pike and saltos) before they land at their feet."</seg>
<seg id="23">"according to the official Olympiad programme, they are rated according to design, difficulty level and" flight time. ""</seg>
<seg id="24">"athletes from 17 countries, 16 men and 16 women compete against each other in Rio."</seg>
<seg id="25">The common Olympic vector is straight ahead.</seg>
<seg id="26">"medallions must move on to gold in their quest for gold, faster, up and down, sometimes to the finish, sometimes back and forth, upwards and downwards at the playground."</seg>
<seg id="27">"they not only hunt the finish line or the output wall, but also another height objective in television transmission: the world or the Olympiarecord."</seg>
<seg id="28">"the goal oriented aspiration is nobel, admirable, even fanatic - and it is enough to even stir up a spectator to tears."</seg>
<seg id="29">But it is also what I perceive myself when looking at these games as something tiresome.</seg>
<seg id="30">The trampoline offers a respite.</seg>
<seg id="31">The vector of the trampoline is above.</seg>
<seg id="32">A forward movement is not the goal.</seg>
<seg id="33">"he or she bounces off, seemingly weightless like an astronaut, goes up, then downward, then effortlessly back up."</seg>
<seg id="34">"there is also a competition, of course not without difficulty, but during exercise there is no hectic attack on the goal, no wolves into the distance, only the dreamy, elegant lifting of time and gravity."</seg>
<seg id="35">It is as Zen as the competition can only be at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the women's qualification and encores will take place on Friday afternoon, in streaming at 13.00 Eastern Time; the men on Saturday, also at 13.00."</seg>
<seg id="37">NBC will radiate the encores as part of an afternoon block on both days from 14.00.</seg>
<seg id="38">"in the midst of the Olympia mania they promise a quiet, nice moment, one that is likely to be overlooked in the general turmoil."</seg>
<seg id="39">"if the increase in consciousness can only be achieved by the angling and the objectiveness of male athletes - as the male US gymnasts proposed recently - according to the Wall Street Journal, Mr. Dooley anticipates his new fan base."</seg>

<seg id="1">"one generation protested" in Ethiopia, Long A ally of the USA "</seg>
<seg id="2">Violent protests in Ethiopia</seg>
<seg id="3">Demonstrators who demand political changes in Ethiopia met violent opposition from the government.</seg>
<seg id="4">Witnesses say dozens of protesters were killed during clashes with police at gunshot.</seg>
<seg id="5">Is Ethiopia just to collapse?</seg>
<seg id="6">"in the last ten years, it was one of the most stable countries in Africa, a solid ally of the West with a rapidly growing economy."</seg>
<seg id="7">"but in recent months protests against the government shook the country, and expanded into more and more areas."</seg>
<seg id="8">Last week thousands of people stormed the streets and demanded fundamental political changes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"according to human rights organisations, the government's response was relentless."</seg>
<seg id="10">Witnesses stated that policemen fired and killed dozens of unarmed protestors.</seg>
<seg id="11">"circulating videos on the protests, which are probably from the last or early of this year, show how security people hit young people with sticks while they were forced to make a stand against a wall."</seg>
<seg id="12">The chief of the UN Human Rights Committee now demands a thorough investigation.</seg>
<seg id="13">"it has always been difficult to hold this country together and in the future it will become even more difficult," said Rashid Abdi, the project leader of the Horn of Africa at the International Crisis Group, a research group. "</seg>
<seg id="14">"after Nigeria, Ethiopia is the most populous country in Africa and its stability is estimated by the West."</seg>
<seg id="15">"American military and intelligence services work closely with the Ethiopians to fight terrorism over the region, especially in Somalia. only a few countries in Africa, if at all, get so much Western help."</seg>
<seg id="16">Ethiopia's economy expanded at a respectable pace.</seg>
<seg id="17">Its infrastructure has dramatically improved - there is a new commuter train in the capital of Addis Ababa.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the streets are generally quiet, safe and clean."</seg>
<seg id="19">"although Ethiopia is anything but a model for democracy - human rights organisations have consistently led oppression by the government - the opposition in the country has been restricted, whereby dissidents were effectively silenced."</seg>
<seg id="20">"many were sent to exile or prison, killed or driven into the expanse of the desert."</seg>
<seg id="21">But that could change.</seg>
<seg id="22">"if you suppress people and they don't have any other options except protesting, it breaks out," said Seat m Tesmobil, a lecturer in central ethiopia. "</seg>
<seg id="23">All the youth are protesting.</seg>
<seg id="24">A generation protests.</seg>
<seg id="25">There are numerous complaints that cover everything from land use to stranglehold regarding the power of the governing coalition.</seg>
<seg id="26">"after a widely criticized election last year, the ruling party and its allies received the last seat of the opposition and now control 100 per cent of the Parliament."</seg>
<seg id="27">"at the same time tensions are rising along the border to Eritrea; a fight for this shaky, controversial line called for hundreds of lives in June."</seg>
<seg id="28">"analysts fear that separatists like the Oromo Liberation Front or the National Liberation Front of Ogaden, who in recent years have been more or less forced to exploit the turbulence and re-arm themselves."</seg>
<seg id="29">Several factors explain why feelings of bitterness after years of hiding behind the surface are now exploding.</seg>
<seg id="30">The first appears harmless: smartphones.</seg>
<seg id="31">"only in recent years, many Ethiopians have been able to communicate with the social media, since cheaper smartphones have become more and more frequent and the internet services improved."</seg>
<seg id="32">"even if the government locks access to Facebook and Twitter, what it does at regular intervals, especially among the protests, many people can still communicate via Internet proxies that hide where they reside."</seg>
<seg id="33">Several young Ethiopians claimed that they were gathered to protest in such a way.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the second factor is that there is more solidarity between the Oromos and Amharas, the two largest ethnic groups in Ethiopia."</seg>
<seg id="35">The Oromos and Amharas are not natural enemies.</seg>
<seg id="36">"for eons, the Amharas, who come from Ethiopia's predominantly Christian highlands, prospered in politics and economy, while they exploited the Oromos, of which many Muslims are and live in lowland areas."</seg>
<seg id="37">But this is changing just as well.</seg>
<seg id="38">"we are here to coordinate under a umbrella," said Mulatu Gemechu, a leader of Oromos. "</seg>
<seg id="39">The greatest protests took place in the areas of Amhara and Oromos.</seg>
<seg id="40">"many Amharas and Oromos have the feeling that Ethiopia is being dominated by members of the ethnic group of the Tigray, which account for about 6 per cent of the population, dominant in the military, intelligence services, trade and politics."</seg>
<seg id="41">The third reason for unrest is the death of Meles Zenawi.</seg>
<seg id="42">"until his death in 2012, Mr. Meles, a former rebel leader, was Prime Minister of Ethiopia for 17 years until his death."</seg>
<seg id="43">"he was regarded as a tactical genius, a man who could think about corners."</seg>
<seg id="44">Analysts say that he was especially versed in perceiving early signs of dissatisfaction and using special officers to process opponents and make them harmless.</seg>
<seg id="45">"the current regime lacks this basic skill," "said Mr. Abdi, a conflict analyst."</seg>
<seg id="46">"Ethiopia's new prime minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, was chosen for relatively opaque reasons to take Mr. Meles's position."</seg>
<seg id="47">"unlike Mr. Meles, who came from the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia, Mr. Hailemariam comes from the south."</seg>
<seg id="48">Analysts say that he does not enjoy the confidence of the security services controlled by the Tigray.</seg>
<seg id="49">Many fear that the result will be more bloodshed.</seg>
<seg id="50">"the last time that Ethiopia had experienced such a turmoil in 2005, after thousands were protesting against elections, which according to analysts apparently pleaded by the government and were subsequently stolen."</seg>
<seg id="51">"during the subsequent raids many protesters were killed, even though they were less than in the last months and that time of unrest went relatively quickly."</seg>
<seg id="52">"experts praised Ethiopia's leaders for their visionary infrastructure planning, such as the new commuter train, as well as for their measurable progress in poverty reduction."</seg>
<seg id="53">But obviously this did not prevent the intensification of the internal grievances of the Ethiopian government.</seg>
<seg id="54">And it takes a dangerous ethnical form.</seg>
<seg id="55">"last month, protesters in Gondar, an amharan city, attacked by Tigray and hatred towards the Tigray is becoming more and more common in social media."</seg>
<seg id="56">Analysts say that the protests bring the US and other Western allies into a peculiar position.</seg>
<seg id="57">"the American government used Ethiopia as the basis for Dronenflüge over the neighbouring Somalia, even though it recently announced that it has closed this base."</seg>
<seg id="58">"while the West clearly wants to support democracy, it does not want its ally to collapse in an already volatile region."</seg>
<seg id="59">"this," said Mr. Abdi, "is a very thin balancing act."</seg>

<seg id="1">Donald Trump explains his assertion Obama has founded ISIS was "sarcasm"</seg>
<seg id="2">"Donald J. Trump attempted to dispel the last controversy surrounding his campaign on Friday, attacking his multi-repeated claim, President Obama and Hillary Clinton would be the" founder "of the terrorist group Islamic State, not serious."</seg>
<seg id="3">This clarification raised new questions on the communications capabilities of the Republican presidential candidate whether he was able to communicate clearly and clearly with the American public.</seg>
<seg id="4">"it also brings his comrades who are trying to take care of him during an eventful phase, into the peculiar position to explain statements he could not have meant at all."</seg>
<seg id="5">"having made the hint at an election campaign on Wednesday evening, Mr. Trump relied on the claim on Thursday and insisted in interviews that he really did not intend to point out, the President and Mrs. Clinton would have created ISIS."</seg>
<seg id="6">"but in an early morning Tweet on Friday, Mr. Trump said he was just sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the Tweet was the opposite to the previous day when Mr. Trump said in a series of interviews, he said the accusation was completely serious."</seg>
<seg id="8">"the conservative Radiomorator Hugh Hewitt Mr. Trump wanted to help weaken the statement by reminding him that Mr. Obama wants to destroy ISIS, the Republican presidential candidate has not wanted to know."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the last storm of criticism impashes Mr. Trump, while he has tried to direct the focus of his campaign to the economic situation due to falling demand."</seg>
<seg id="10">Mr. Trump and Mrs. Clinton gave speeches to the economic situation in Michigan this week.</seg>
<seg id="11">On Friday Mr. Trump attempted to return to this subject again.</seg>
<seg id="12">"using Twitter, he warned that Mrs. Clinton's suggestion would lead to higher taxes and that he found her speech boring."</seg>
<seg id="13">Mr. Trump has already brought sarcasm to his defense.</seg>
<seg id="14">"at the end of July he criticised himself when he said that the Russians should chop Mrs Clinton's emails, but later he explained" "Of course I said the sarcastic."</seg>
<seg id="15">This method allows Mr. Trump to postpone the linguistic boundaries in politics and then to rowing back to demand.</seg>
<seg id="16">"I think it is one of his methods to test how certain messages are received by his fans, how they arrive, and then" clarify "depending on how the reaction fails." said Ruth Sherman, a communication expert who observed the language of both candidates. "</seg>
<seg id="17">"but I think he is clever enough to keep his statements vague enough, so that they can be interpreted in different ways."</seg>
<seg id="18">"instead of defusing the tone for the presidential elections, Mr. Trump accepted an even more estimated sound, as his survey values went further."</seg>
<seg id="19">"a new survey by NBC / Wall Street Journal / Maris, which was published on Friday, showed a lead in the states North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado and a head-to-head race in Florida."</seg>
<seg id="20">"while Mr. Trump is generally trying to not apologize for his provocative statements, he often blames his critics to distort his statements or misunderstand his humor."</seg>
<seg id="21">"but while he focuses the attention of attention during the last months of his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump Scherze has brought his loyal comrades into the uncomfortable situation, regardless of how provocative his statements may be."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York and one of Trump's most prominent speakers, tried to defend the candidate today in a CNN interview from Thursday."</seg>
<seg id="23">"I believe what he says are legitimate, political comments," Mr. Giuliani, therefore, asked Mr. Giuliani about the correctness of Mr. Trump's statements whether Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton had founded the Islamic State. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"it is true in this sense that before Obama ISIS was an almost unknown, small organization, he called it backbenchers, completely wrong and therefore it happened because he withdrew the troops from Iraq."</seg>
<seg id="25">"most mainstream republicans try to argue that the government under Obama, in which Mrs. Clinton served as foreign minister, allowed ISIS to spread the situation in the Middle East aggressively under control."</seg>
<seg id="26">"before the campaign events in Pennsylvania on Friday, Mr. Trump continued his attacks on the media and accused them of running around on each of his words and being preoccupied against him."</seg>
<seg id="27">"he ridiculed the" poor, pathetic "television experts who try to understand and said," You can't!. ""</seg>
<seg id="28">Some of the Democrats ridiculed Mr. Trump's apology as just another proof that he was unsuitable for the presidency.</seg>

<seg id="5">"it was an act of culinary solidarity with suffering people," "said Jane Burman."</seg>
<seg id="6">"her husband Andrew Coe added," It was also a message to the Americans how they should eat. "</seg>
<seg id="7">The couple lives in Brooklyn Heights and are both food historians.</seg>
<seg id="8">"COE last book" "Chop Suey" "acted by Chinese cuisine in the USA while Brickman told in her book" 97 Orchard "about life in a residential house on the Lower East Side from a food perspective."</seg>
<seg id="9">"her latest collaboration," A decent meal, "which will appear on Tuesday at Harper Verlag, illustrates the history of American cuisine during the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="10">"they showed culinary solidarity as they meet with a reporter in the Eisenberg's Sandwich Shop for dinner, a small, straightforward snack at the Flatiron District, which has been in business since the crash of 1929."</seg>
<seg id="11">"brick, 54, ordered a fresh cheese sandwich with olive pieces, while Coe, 57, turkey ate with mashed potatoes and vegetable mixture."</seg>
<seg id="12">"when the reporter ordered chippers, this found the couple fit for a discussion of the food in the era of the Great Depression."</seg>
<seg id="13">"rich foods were very popular," "said Brickman."</seg>
<seg id="14">"there was peanut bread, cheese and bean bread."</seg>
<seg id="15">They were prepared from an ingredient and something cheap that stretches the ingredient.</seg>
<seg id="16">Imagine eating as many peanuts that they serve them as dinner.</seg>
<seg id="17">CoE grins.</seg>
<seg id="18">"it must have appealed to the stomach like lead," "he said."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in the years before the Great Depression the table was in an American budget, especially in rural areas, an all-You-Can-Eat buffet."</seg>
<seg id="20">"men of women cooked for male rims and it was served freshly baked pate for breakfast, lunch and dinner."</seg>
<seg id="21">"it was the Americans who sent food to hungry Europeans during the First World War." "a Square Meal" "marks the roads with which the country was going to be no longer the land of land."</seg>
<seg id="22">"it was a time when food for the Americans became a central, tense subject," "said Coe, why he and his wife wanted to write about it."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the new budget was equally tense: mysterious dishes such as bread and casserole were considered to be staple food, the casserolle as a" "wonderful way to reuse food leftovers", "noted Brickman, as chefs were able to hide unappetizing ingredients from a creamy sauce."</seg>
<seg id="24">Fresh fruit was replaced by cheaper dried fruit.</seg>
<seg id="25">"meat, which was the focal point of American cuisine for years, became a rarely served luxury."</seg>
<seg id="26">"strange mixtures have been tried out, because a calorie-rich and nutritious satisfaction has priority over taste or even sound common sense."</seg>
<seg id="27">"while researching the book, which also includes recipes, Ziegelman prepared a dish of this period, baked onions with peanut butter."</seg>

<seg id="1">Greenland-shark: the oldest vertebrate is almost 400 years old</seg>
<seg id="2">Rare sight.</seg>
<seg id="3">Greenland-arks usually come to the surface only in the winter.</seg>
<seg id="4">This shark was allowed to return to the sea after an investigation on board the research ship Sanna.</seg>
<seg id="5">He was born in 1624 and floats at about 1 km / h through the North Atlantic - until today.</seg>
<seg id="6">Greenland will only get offspring with 150 years of age.</seg>
<seg id="7">"leisurely, the Greenland-shark swims along the northern Atlantic, in an hour, it reaches just 1,220 metres in an average."</seg>
<seg id="8">"only when it matters, the five-metre-long animal accelerates to a full 2.6 km / h - and is half as fast as a seal with this top speed."</seg>
<seg id="9">"this lifestyle, characterized by slowness, seems to be a staple for a high age."</seg>
<seg id="10">"Julius Nielsen from the University of Copenhagen and his colleagues report in the journal" Science "in any case from a Greenland-shark, which could be 392 years old."</seg>
<seg id="11">"madness," commented Alexander Scheuerlein of the Max-Planck-Institute for demographic research in Rostock this life span, which means a world record for vertebrates. "</seg>
<seg id="12">Although the evolutionary biologist suspected that Greenland's hair became stony.</seg>
<seg id="13">Only lacked the evidence.</seg>
<seg id="14">"Greenland arks are hard to observe, after all, they live mainly in the ice sea in front of the sparsely populated coasts of Canada, Greenland, Norway and Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="15">"because they prefer water temperatures around the six degrees Celsius, they usually appear only in the winter on the surface."</seg>
<seg id="16">Researchers know little about the lifestyle of Greenland hairs.</seg>
<seg id="17">"their slow motion, they measured, when they equipped six animals with a transmitter in front of Svalbard."</seg>
<seg id="18">"nevertheless, in the stomach of an animal, researchers found the remains of a seal, another had swallowed the jawbone of a young polar bear."</seg>
<seg id="19">Possibly they hunt down sleeping animals or patrol at the bottom of the icecore and look for cadaver rising from higher water-layers down torches.</seg>
<seg id="20">Julius Nielsen and his colleagues now examined 28 Greenland hairs that fishermen caught between 2010 and 2013 from Greenland or Svalbard as bycatch from the depths of the North Atlantic.</seg>
<seg id="21">"the smallest shark was just 81 centimeters long, while the largest 502 centimeters measured."</seg>
<seg id="22">"to determine the age of the animals, they analysed the lens nucleus of the sharks with the carbon-14 method."</seg>
<seg id="23">"this centre of the eye lens is born before the birth of the sharks, the proteins contained therein will no longer be renewed later."</seg>
<seg id="24">The two smallest sharks had a noticeable amount of carbon-14 in the lens nucleus.</seg>
<seg id="25">"her birth was therefore to lie after the early 1960s, when atomic weapons attempts to drag bigger amounts of this radioactive carbon into the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="26">"in the third-smallest animal with 220 centimeters of length, the lentil nucleus, on the other hand, contained a small surplus of carbon-14 from the nuclear weapons, it is expected to celebrate its 50th birthday in 2012."</seg>
<seg id="27">"all major Greenland hairs, on the other hand, had normal carbon-14 quantities in their lens nucleus, which arises through cosmic radiation in the atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="28">"in fact, the carbon-14 clock for a 493 centimeter-long Greenland-shark showed an age of 335 years, while the record-shark is likely to be 392 years old with 502 centimeters."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that Greenland-shark females only get offspring when they are longer than four meters, was known."</seg>
<seg id="30">"now, the researchers were able to classify the length of an age."</seg>
<seg id="31">"since one of the animals with 392 centimeters probably stood at the threshold of the sexually mature and its age was determined at 156 years, Greenland arks with the multiplication obviously permit at least one and a half centuries."</seg>
<seg id="32">This is also likely to be world record for vertebrates.</seg>
<seg id="33">The fact that such methoteces live mainly in icy waters is no coincidence.</seg>
<seg id="34">"the previous record holder, a 211 year old Greenland whale, in whose bacon at the neck was a 120-year-old harpoon tip, was caught in front of Alaska."</seg>
<seg id="35">"due to the low temperatures, the organism of the animals living there often runs on asparagus."</seg>
<seg id="36">So they mature later - and age slowly.</seg>
<seg id="37">"in order to keep warm in the cold water, the animals are often very large."</seg>
<seg id="38">"because the volume grows much faster than its surface, through which the animal loses heat."</seg>
<seg id="39">The heat loss of one gram mouse is therefore much larger than with one gram elephant.</seg>
<seg id="40">Another advantage: you have fewer enemies.</seg>
<seg id="41">"a smaller animal lives more dangerous and should focus on as many descendants as possible as possible," explains the evolutionary biologist Scheuerlein. "</seg>
<seg id="42">"a very large animal, on the other hand, should invest its resources in a long life."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the competition with Paris, Dublin and Luxembourg, the city on the Main has the best chances of attracting jobs and companies from London."</seg>
<seg id="3">"it is very likely that Frankfurt will benefit most from the Brexit Votum," says Michael Voigtländer, head of the IW's financial markets and real estate markets. "</seg>
<seg id="4">"according to the Brexit referendum, it is uncertain whether money houses continue to operate from London from financial transactions across the EU."</seg>

<seg id="16">"at the Seine, the rents for first-class commercial real estate are by 50 percent higher than in the Main."</seg>

<seg id="2">The miniaturists from the pastoral care unit Eyachtal-Haigerloch St. Anna were on the way on a four-day pilgrimage from Villingen to Freiburg.</seg>
<seg id="3">"together, four stages were met."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in order to bridge the time up to the next pilgrimage of all Ministrants in two years, the Upper Ministers of Ministers of St. Anna decided to prepare and conduct a several-day pilgrimage."</seg>
<seg id="5">"various pilgrimage destinations were examined and one finally decided in favour of the Episcopal City of Fribourg, where, during the Holy Year of Mercy, a special pilgrimage destination was offered at the Freiburg Minster."</seg>
<seg id="6">"16 Minis of Bittelbronn, Grubenshole, and Haigerloch, and the hallowed rooms set themselves in the way."</seg>
<seg id="7">"in the evening before, pastor Storost sent the pilgrims in a small celebration in St. Anna, blessed the Pilgrimage Cruces and told the pilgrims."</seg>
<seg id="8">"from Horb we drove by train to the starting point Villingen, where also a Münster Unserer was standing and so the pilgrimage route took place from Münster."</seg>
<seg id="9">"the single day tours were framed in the morning and in the evening with a short impulse, with different prayers, songs and writing texts."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but also on the way, the Minis on field crosses, chapels or churches again and again Rast to sing a song from specially assembled pilgrim song."</seg>
<seg id="11">"for the overnight stays, the parish homes of the local parishes were available."</seg>
<seg id="12">"at the stage destinations, Alexandra Burkhardt and Heidi Faller ensured a tasty and tasty dinner and breakfast."</seg>
<seg id="13">"on the second day, we continued through Furtwangen to Gütenbach."</seg>
<seg id="14">"the day after that, one stepped on the stage to St. Peter, which was the most strenuous route, but at first some 500 altimeters had to be lowered and afterwards climbed again."</seg>
<seg id="15">The deserved reward was a common barbecue at the swimming pool in the evening.</seg>
<seg id="16">"after the morning impulse on the fourth day of pilgrimage in the impressive monastery church of St. Peter, we went to Freiburg."</seg>
<seg id="17">"visibly facilitated and happy, the Minis arrived at the Freiburg Minster in the late afternoon and passed through the gate of mercy."</seg>
<seg id="18">With a small impulse God was given thanks.</seg>

<seg id="2">Scotland's Callum Skinner last evening in the men's racing car Sprint in Rio for fame when the British team defended the title of London 2012.</seg>
<seg id="3">"the 23-year-old from Glasgow took the anchor roll, who had made his fellow countryman Sir Chris Hoy to Eigen."</seg>
<seg id="4">England claimed a shocking victory four years ago while Hoy won the fifth of six Olympic medals.</seg>
<seg id="5">They repeated the trick after they took a modest sixth place in March at the London Underground World Championships despite the Hoys regatta.</seg>
<seg id="6">The problem between Beijing and London was the replacement of the driver Jamie Staff.</seg>
<seg id="7">They did this in time as execution.</seg>
<seg id="8">Hoys retired engendered a gap that Kian Emadi and Matt Crampton tried to close.</seg>
<seg id="9">Skinner was the man with whom they stayed when they saw potential in the bulkhead that has now unfolded.</seg>
<seg id="10">"Hinder, Kenny - the four years ago with Hoy victorious - and Skinner made an Olympic record in the qualification rounds, but in the standard rounds the New Zealanders won the first round."</seg>
<seg id="11">And the British trio won the duel with gold.</seg>
<seg id="12">"after his lap, Hinder was barely back, but Kenny brought the team forward and Skinner held it."</seg>
<seg id="13">"a change of strategy made a major part of the transformation, moving in a higher gear to slow it down and allow Kenny and above all Skinner to keep pace."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Hoy looked at his position as BBC expert and noticed Skinner, Kenny and Hinds when they climbed onto the podium."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the 23-year-old Skinner from Glasgow said:" "it's a flattering comparison."</seg>
<seg id="16">I'm just here to do my best and make a name.</seg>
<seg id="17">We have set up a olymparecord in the final round and defeated the World Champion.</seg>
<seg id="18">It was just unbelievable.</seg>
<seg id="19">There is no better way to win this.</seg>
<seg id="20">"after the 2012 triumph at Kenny's and Hoys side, there was a hint that after a weak start he deliberately fell on the track."</seg>
<seg id="21">He later returned this statement and there was no objection to England's rivals.</seg>
<seg id="22">"with such an outstanding victory, this time there was no such issue."</seg>
<seg id="23">"Hinder said," "It feels like the whole UK flags on the tribune like London."</seg>
<seg id="24">We have joined together as a team in the last three months.</seg>
<seg id="25">We did so badly with so many world titles that it was unbelievable to win back at the Olympics.</seg>
<seg id="26">"this is an event, a gold medal for the nation, which were won seven out of ten titles both in Beijing and London."</seg>
<seg id="27">"if this is a barometer of our progress over the last five months, we expect successful five days in the velodrome."</seg>
<seg id="28">"with the form of Kenny, it is possible to repeat Hoys's victory of three Olympic gold medals in a competition."</seg>
<seg id="29">"that would be for Kenny, who was born exactly 12 years younger than Hoy, who was also born on March 23rd (a seemingly holy date for British sports; on that day also Steve Redgrave, Mo Farah and Roger Bannister were born) - an abundance of six gold medals and a silver medal."</seg>
<seg id="30">That would be the same as Hoy.</seg>
<seg id="31">"Kenny is next in the Sprint, which starts today and will go for more than three days."</seg>
<seg id="32">The 28-year-old from Bolton said: "I only enjoy this for the moment."</seg>
<seg id="33">The team event is always best.</seg>
<seg id="34">You can win it with his colleagues.</seg>
<seg id="35">It feels a bit lonely to win alone.</seg>
<seg id="36">"he said," "If he wins two more gold medals, he should be beaten to the knight."</seg>
<seg id="37">"it was the only medal competition of the day, but there were other good news for England."</seg>
<seg id="38">"Sir Bradly Wiggins, Ed Clancy, Steven Burke and Owain Doull qualified with the fastest performance in the four-kilometer race."</seg>
<seg id="39">They arrived at the destination in 3: 51.942.</seg>
<seg id="40">"the world record, which won gold in London in 2012, was 3: 51,659."</seg>
<seg id="41">"the first and final round (22.42) will take place today on the second day of the competition, where Wiggins will be focusing on safety."</seg>
<seg id="42">"yesterday, he had contested with delegates before the qualification, when officials called him to measure his height."</seg>
<seg id="43">"Laura Trott, Joanna Rowsell Shandong, Elinor Barker and Katie Archibald of Milngavie in World Record Time in 4: 13,260."</seg>
<seg id="44">The UK team relies on his strong track team to dominate the middle period of the Olympic Games and get a band of medals.</seg>
<seg id="45">"after a truly extraordinary presentation of absolute dominance in Beijing and London, the expectations for Rio were shut down."</seg>
<seg id="46">"there were drama in the background, so the resignation of the technical director Shane Sutton in April amidst sexism and mobbing penalties as well as retirement of sizes like Hoy and Victoria Pendleton."</seg>
<seg id="47">"however, if one looks at the first evening of the competition in the velodrome, it looks like the legendary reputation GBs, which reached its peak at the perfect moment, could be repeated again."</seg>

<seg id="1">Future of the melting of Portland due to the lifting of the energy yield</seg>
<seg id="2">"the future of the aluminium melting of Portland in Victoria - as well as hundreds of workstations of workers - are at stake, as the plant operator terminates the energy supply contract and thereby cancels all supply contracts, such as the supplying energy company."</seg>
<seg id="3">"this step followed the decision of the government in Victoria beginning of this year, no further subsidies to operate the plant."</seg>
<seg id="4">A subsidy for 20 years will expire in November.</seg>
<seg id="5">Up to 2000 jobs in the system of Alcoa in Portland are at stake.</seg>
<seg id="6">No less than 2000 jobs -direct and indirect - could be at risk at closure.</seg>
<seg id="7">"in addition, it could come to domino effects, since the melt-dairy consumes around 10 percent of the total electricity generation at Victorias."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in 2014, Alcoa joined Point Henry Schmelzer, which last year led to a closure of the Anglesea power plant."</seg>
<seg id="9">The meltdown of Alcoa in Portland loses money and risks closure.</seg>
<seg id="10">"this step follows the years of speculation with regard to the future of the plant, originally as a result of the strong Australian dollar and last because of the electricity price for the plant."</seg>
<seg id="11">"AGL, which supplies the large aluminium melt with its Loy Yang A power plant in Latrobe Valley, announced that three other owners will announce their contracts."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the plant is owned by a joint venture of Alcoa and Alumina, of which the Chinese company CITIC and the Japanese Marubeni Corp hold smaller portions."</seg>
<seg id="13">"AGL assumes that the plant will continue to operate in Portland, which means further physical demand for electricity by smelting," "said the company."</seg>
<seg id="14">"AGL continued to say that the contracts were" "hedging transactions", "which should have entered into force in November 2016."</seg>
<seg id="15">"the contracts have a 12 month notice period, so that they will end in 2017."</seg>
<seg id="16">"as a result, AGL assumes that the contracts in the financial year 17 will contribute to revenues," "said the electricity supplier."</seg>
<seg id="17">Forecasts to 2019 illustrate how the market is set to change.</seg>
<seg id="18">AGL reported that it had already written the value of the contracts in its annual subscription in the amount of $187 million in "expecting a cancellation."</seg>
<seg id="19">"Alcoa said the decision to book the contracts, the" ability of Alcoas... to run the smelting or to ensure the power supply to the melt "does not interfere."</seg>
<seg id="20">"the U.S. company said it had concluded a 20-year contract with Loy Yang in 2010, which should have entered into force from November this year even if there is yet another explanation why it has resigned from the contract."</seg>
<seg id="21">Analysts warn of the bad economic conditions of the industry prior to the possible closure of the Portland Schmeling in Victoria and the Tomago facility near Newcastle.</seg>
<seg id="22">"in reference to the statements of analysts at the beginning of the week, the Head of Operations Stephen Mikkelsen said that Portland uses around 600 megawatts of electricity per year to consume around 900 megawatts of electricity."</seg>
<seg id="23">"should both systems disappear from the market, this would mean a significant reduction in demand on the [electricity market]."</seg>
<seg id="24">"and for us as a generator it wouldn't be good," he said. "</seg>

<seg id="2">"Kendall Jenner, 20, Model and fourth daughter of the manager and mother of the Kardashian Jenner clan, Kris is on the cover of the coveted September issue of the US Vogue."</seg>
<seg id="3">"Kendall, the brand ambassador of Estée Lauder and ran to fashion Weeks in Milan, Paris and New York, announced on Thursday the news on its Instagram account."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in a room full of people I love, the sight of this cover made me cry," Kendall wrote. "</seg>
<seg id="5">"disclosure of the cover followed a bizarre (or simply Keeping Up with the Kardashians like?), watched reality video showing the entire Kardashian Jenner family (with the exception of Rob and Caitlyn's most popular Showbiz uncles and producers of Keeping Up Ryan Seacorn)."</seg>
<seg id="6">"this represents the cliché-based plot almost every birthday episode of a children's show (Seacorn brought the sentence" "You thought we had forgotten you?" "with the honesty of a cartoon on a slot at 8 o'clock in the morning), but Kris had to let her other girls take part in this publicity."</seg>
<seg id="7">"with regard to the September edition of the Vogue, surely a new era of kardashians began."</seg>
<seg id="8">"Kendall's big sister Kim likes her, as for the Vogue cover (she and her husband Kanye West were to be seen in April 2014), but the cover of the September issue of the magazine is a league for himself."</seg>
<seg id="9">The September issue is the most sold edition of the year for Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="10">"with a circumference that resembles a fashion magazine rather than a fashion magazine, the issue draws a large number of advertisers (Laut Fashionista were advertisement from the 832 pages of the tome 615 pages advertising)."</seg>
<seg id="11">The revelation of his cover star is so eagerly awaited that in the last two years pictures of the magazine still seep before the official announcement.</seg>
<seg id="12">"women already on the cover include Naomi Campbell, Linda Evangelista and Kate Moss."</seg>
<seg id="13">"in recent years, there were clearly more celebrities that modelled" "models that are celebrities" "on the cover."</seg>
<seg id="14">"Oscar prize winner and designer Jennifer Lawrence was on the cover in 2013, one year after Lady Gaga had the honor."</seg>
<seg id="15">"but even with the little chance that Mrs. Jenner - who is described by the magazine as the" "breakthrough model" "of her generation - falls under the earlier category, she is in good company."</seg>
<seg id="16">These celebrities aren't related to famous people or reality stars or teenagers today who know how to make a good snapshot video (even if everything is true of Jenner).</seg>
<seg id="17">They are really talented women who stand out in the entertainment industry.</seg>
<seg id="18">"Beyonce, who appeared on the last cover, had one of the most successful years of her career with the publication of Lemonade."</seg>
<seg id="19">"of course, Jenners do not like success to everyone."</seg>
<seg id="20">"with its reality TV story, Jenners's position in the world of fashion was always somewhat tense."</seg>
<seg id="21">In June the former Victoria's Secret-model Stephanie Seymour Jenner and her colleague Gigi Hadid criticized and called them "the mistasy of the moment."</seg>
<seg id="22">These feelings turned up again when the message came out with the appearance of Jenners on the Vogue cover.</seg>
<seg id="23">But lying around on the displeasure seems to pass by at the point.</seg>
<seg id="24">Kendall Jenner is on the cover of the September edition of the Vogue.</seg>
<seg id="25">It is a supermodel in the truest sense of the word.</seg>
<seg id="26">It runs for Marc Jacobs.</seg>
<seg id="27">It makes advertising for your primer by Estee Lauder.</seg>
<seg id="28">She and all her sisters are selling pictures of themselves on their respective paywall apps.</seg>

<seg id="3">The successors today dominate the world - its manufacturer experienced a disaster.</seg>
<seg id="4">The device weighed almost half a kilogram and was more than four times as heavy as an iPhone 5.</seg>
<seg id="5">"it was thicker and bigger, so it was not good in the hand."</seg>
<seg id="6">"on the contrary, it was quite punky."</seg>
<seg id="7">"the built-in memory initially amounted to eight megabytes, which would be enough for about two selfies with high resolution."</seg>
<seg id="8">An iPhone is now delivered with at least 16 gigabytes.</seg>
<seg id="9">"the Nokia 9000 communicator came into business exactly 20 years ago, on August 15, 1996, and it was the first smartphone."</seg>
<seg id="10">"for a few euros, fans can buy the equipment on the internet, but they somehow come from the Stone Age of the Internet age."</seg>
<seg id="11">"20 years ago, however, the communicator was a sensation."</seg>
<seg id="12">"the Finnish mobile phone manufacturer had announced the product a few months earlier at the computer fair Cebit in Hanover as" "Office in Western pocket format". ""</seg>
<seg id="13">"in fact, the new mobile phone could be sent and received for then standards: SMS and e-mails could be sent and received, even by fax was the communicator."</seg>
<seg id="14">"even the access to web pages was possible using HTML browsers, albeit tormenting slowly."</seg>
<seg id="15">"a calculator was available, a digital address book and an electronic calendar."</seg>
<seg id="16">"there was a small antenna, and the mobile phone could be folded up like a laptop."</seg>
<seg id="17">Then there was a small keyboard and a black and white screen.</seg>
<seg id="18">"the price was quite proud: 2700 D-Mark, i.e. about 1400 Euro."</seg>
<seg id="19">The average retail price of a smartphone in Germany was 392 euros in 2015.</seg>
<seg id="20">No one could suspect in August 1996 that the communicator would be the beginning of the smartphone era.</seg>
<seg id="21">"since then, everything is different."</seg>
<seg id="22">"the smart phones are a success story, though not for Nokia."</seg>
<seg id="23">"the Finns" mobile phone line experienced an unprecedented disaster, eventually being sold and handled at Microsoft. "</seg>
<seg id="24">"today, the market is dominated by suppliers who all came much later than Nokia."</seg>

<seg id="26">"in 2015, there were nearly two billion smartphone users worldwide."</seg>
<seg id="27">"approximately 1.4 billion devices were sold, on Samsung and Apple accounted for 555 million units."</seg>

<seg id="2">Heathrow will not only bring renewal and prosperity in our local communities and throughout London but throughout the country.</seg>
<seg id="3">"for me, this was the biggest attraction of Heathrow, just as in 2012 in London when we had a great effort to make sure all our nations and regions benefited from the games."</seg>
<seg id="4">The Olympiad brought great benefits to Stratford and the East End.</seg>
<seg id="5">And we will achieve this again by creating new opportunities for local residents and companies close to Heathrow.</seg>

<seg id="2">"according to the projections of a new NASA climate model, Venus was probably inhabited once."</seg>
<seg id="3">Scientists at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies of NASA developed a model to discover the past of Venus based on tools and algorithms that resemble those of climate scientists.</seg>
<seg id="4">"the model was designed to determine whether the Venus could have had similar conditions, with its hot, waterless surface and CO2-dense atmosphere."</seg>
<seg id="5">Scientists have previously indicated that the slow rotation of Venus could be explained by its dense atmosphere.</seg>
<seg id="6">"but the latest simulation suggests that Venus could have had a thin, erdlike atmosphere and yet turned slowly."</seg>
<seg id="7">The model also illuminated the topography of the early Venus.</seg>
<seg id="8">"the planet probably indicated more dry areas than earth, but once had enough water and geographic variability to accommodate life and protected from fast evaporation."</seg>
<seg id="9">The early Venus also benefited from a sun that was 30 percent weaker.</seg>
<seg id="10">"in the GISS model simulation the slow rotation of Venus has exposed its day side of the sun for almost two months," explained GISS scientist Anthony Del Genio in a press release. "</seg>
<seg id="11">"this warms the surface and produces rain that creates a thick layer of clouds, which works like an umbrella to shield the surface from most of the solar heat."</seg>
<seg id="12">The result is average temperatures that are some degrees cooler than that of the earth today.</seg>
<seg id="13">The model brought forth a history of Venus that resembles evolution that was previously thought by planet researchers.</seg>
<seg id="14">"although it was once believed to be habitable, Venus -- in the course of several billions years --has been exposed to too much heat and ultraviolet light."</seg>
<seg id="15">Their oceans evaporated and their water vapor was burnt away from ultraviolet light.</seg>
<seg id="16">"as their hydrogene, only a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide escaped with a deadly greenhouse effect -- the Venus, which as we know it today."</seg>

<seg id="3">The new data help astronomers understand why stars revolve at different rates in the Sternenhaufen and in what context the rotation-time periods are associated with planetary emergence.</seg>
<seg id="4">"we hope that by comparing our results with other stars, we learn more about the relationship between the mass of a star, its age and even the history of its solar system," said Luisa Rebull, a researcher at Caltech's Infrared Processing and Analysis Center in Pasadena, in a press release.

<seg id="1">"Datenklau: so perfide, hackers blackmail their ransom"</seg>
<seg id="2">Programmers of blackmail-malware are currently targeting companies - and are successful in doing so.</seg>
<seg id="3">"according to a recent survey of malware defenses specialists malwarebytes under 540 companies in North America, Great Britain and Germany, 40 percent of the surveyed companies in the past twelve months have at least once, sometimes several times victims of an attack with blackmail software."</seg>
<seg id="4">"in Germany, nearly 20 percent of companies were already the target of Ransomware blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="5">40 percent of the victims willingly paid the ransom paid by the perpetrators to recover the attacked systems and data.</seg>
<seg id="6">The perpetrators specialize their blackmail software according to the observations of Malwarebytes explicitly on attacks in company networks.</seg>
<seg id="7">"if they are successful there, the potential to save money is significantly higher than with private users."</seg>
<seg id="8">"we are currently watching a terrifying rapid evolution of the malware," explains Malwarebytes chef Marcin Kleczynski in conversation with the "world." "</seg>
<seg id="9">"in 2008, most of the malware programs were designed to send advertising."</seg>
<seg id="10">Then the perpetrators discovered blackmail software for themselves.</seg>
<seg id="11">"only private users were the target, but the change to company attacks took place in recent months."</seg>
<seg id="12">"Ransomware works on a simple pattern: once active on the victim's computer, it searches for recently changed files such as Word-, Excel or database files as well as for archives of images and videos."</seg>
<seg id="13">These files encrypt the ransomware and erase the originals lastingly.</seg>
<seg id="14">"subsequently, the software presents the demands of the blackmail."</seg>
<seg id="15">"in order to get the encryption code to the files, the victims need to transfer money - mostly in the form of the Cryptogen Bitcoin."</seg>
<seg id="16">"however, where private users use the personal photo database on the game, companies are concerned about sensitive customer data or project databases without which production is shut down."</seg>
<seg id="17">"accordingly, the damage is higher when a ransomware strikes."</seg>
<seg id="18">"22 percent of German companies reported sales losses through Ransomware, 13 percent even had to completely interrupt business operation, in one case people were in danger of life."</seg>
<seg id="19">"in Germany, several hospitals have already been victims of attacks, whose patients can be acutely threatened by the loss of medical records."</seg>
<seg id="20">"we always say to the victims," "Don't pay, you only support the problem," "explains Kleczynski."</seg>
<seg id="21">"however, 80 to 90 percent of the companies that pay will get their data back."</seg>
<seg id="22">"in view of standstill in operation, it is difficult for managers to reject the demand of the perpetrators."</seg>
<seg id="23">The hackers in turn know this and try everything to build a good reputation.</seg>
<seg id="24">"in a recent study, the safety researchers of F-Secure analyzed the user interfaces and contact with blackmail and come to the conclusion: the perpetrators actually try to build a kind of customer service in order to take more money."</seg>
<seg id="25">"they explain to their victims via chat, how they can pay per Bitcoin, set up freely available support websites or decrypt for example files."</seg>
<seg id="26">"and if private individuals are redeemed after payments of only a few hundred euros, companies sometimes have to negotiate hard and pay five-digit sums in order to get their data unencrypted."</seg>
<seg id="27">"given the potentially high and relatively low risk profits from the ransomware-blackmail, hackers become more and more professional and share their work, explains safety expert Chester Wisniewski from the anti-virus provider SOPHOS:" a single person can write a ransomware approximately within a week. "</seg>
<seg id="28">"however, it is more likely that these are three or four persons."</seg>
<seg id="29">The programmers sell their malicious software in the form of a software modular system to the actual blackmail.</seg>

<seg id="2">Honda HR-V is flexible and suitable for everyday use</seg>
<seg id="3">"in the small HR-V Honda will pack everything: a little SUV, a little coupé and even the versatility of a minivan."</seg>
<seg id="4">"sounds rather overloaded, but the HR-V, which has been constructed on the same new platform as the new jazz, proves to be extremely flexible in everyday life."</seg>
<seg id="5">"although the only 1.60 m high HR-V is rather small, the passengers have plenty of space in both the first and rear seats, it does not work in any place."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the materials of the interior are well finished and have a pleasant effect, only the cockpit-top accrues something."</seg>
<seg id="7">The HR-V is more versatile than comparable vehicles in the storage room.</seg>
<seg id="8">"there is not only a trunk of 453 l for high-rise and 1026 l with reversed back rests, but there is the" "Magic Seats". ""</seg>
<seg id="9">"this is less magical than it sounds: the seat surfaces of the rear bench can be folded up like Kinosound and thus offer storage space, which is up to 1.24 m high from the floor up to the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="10">"the trunk can be loaded very well, but the load height of 650 mm is slightly higher than the comparable Peugeot in 2008."</seg>
<seg id="11">The tested 1.6-liter diesel with 88 kW / 120 hp accelerates the HR-V very powerful thanks to the torque of up to 300 Nm in wide speed ranges.</seg>

<seg id="14">There is another engine type: a 1.5-liter gasoline engine with 96 kW / 130 hp.</seg>
<seg id="15">A four-wheel drive is not offered.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the driving behavior is balanced, a good compromise between dynamics and comfort."</seg>
<seg id="17">But the steering should be a bit more direct.</seg>
<seg id="18">"in the tested top variant" "Executive" "the equipment leaves nothing to be desired."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the security systems include the City emergency braking assistant (working at speeds 32), the collision warning system and the track maintenance assistant."</seg>
<seg id="20">The collision warning sometimes irritates because he assesses many obstacles as "approaching objects" when manoeuvring.</seg>
<seg id="21">The high-beam assistant works very reliably.</seg>
<seg id="22">And the intelligent temperature controller reacts to the road sign detection and reacts speed if required.</seg>
<seg id="23">"however, the full connectivity is only available for the top features: 7-inch touchscreen, navigation device, app integration and more."</seg>
<seg id="24">Two USB and one HDMI connector are under the armrest and are therefore slightly cumbersome.</seg>
<seg id="25">"the approximately 29,000 euros for the well-equipped top diesels are fine."</seg>

<seg id="2">"in the evening, one walks around eternally, at night one is awake for hours, in the morning it is already far from the wake-up ring no longer to think of sleep."</seg>
<seg id="3">This is anything but relaxing.</seg>
<seg id="4">"after all, you are in good company with such problems: according to the Robert Koch Institute, about a quarter of adults have sleep disorders and more than ten percent feel their sleep frequently or permanently as not relaxing."</seg>
<seg id="5">How do sleeping problems or sleep disorders manifest?</seg>
<seg id="6">"there are several forms of sleep disorders, and there can be many reasons behind them, emphasised Hans-Günter Weeß, member of the board of the German Society for Decorative Deception and Sleep Medicine."</seg>
<seg id="7">"what one generally understands, however, is the Insomnia, that is, a disturbance and a disturbance."</seg>
<seg id="8">"just through sleep many people feel unsatisfactory or inadequate, says Jens Wagenknecht, member of the board of the German house doctor association with practice in Varel in Lower Saxony."</seg>
<seg id="9">What is behind sleep disorders?</seg>
<seg id="10">The causes of sleep disorders are complex.</seg>
<seg id="11">"there can be organic, mental or behavioural factors, but also medicines."</seg>
<seg id="12">"often, sleep disturbance is an expression of another disorder."</seg>
<seg id="13">"very early awakening is mostly common in depression," says Weeß. "</seg>
<seg id="14">And it can be that different factors condition one another.</seg>
<seg id="15">"who, for example, has a herniated disc, can lie poorly, guards every two to three hours and may start to pondering about everyday problems and worries, there's an example."</seg>
<seg id="16">"this leads to tension, and sleep is no longer possible."</seg>
<seg id="17">When should sleep disorders become a doctor?</seg>
<seg id="18">"if you do not sleep well over a month in at least three nights a week and are compromised the day, you should go to the doctor, advises Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="19">"the impairment can look very different: one is downcast, tired, sleepy, has difficulties with the attention and concentration, is easily irritable, has mood swings or physical ailments like stomach or headaches."</seg>
<seg id="20">"in order to alleviate the sleep disturbance, it is important to find out their causes."</seg>
<seg id="21">"treatment options include behavioural changes, cognitive behavioural therapy or medicines - classic sleeping tablets only in exceptional cases and at most for two weeks."</seg>
<seg id="22">"Dr. Ingo Fietze, head of the interdisciplinary sleeping medical center of the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, is hardly available in Germany."</seg>
<seg id="23">"therefore, one should first turn to the primary doctor in case of sleeping problems, advises Weeß."</seg>
<seg id="24">This can be clarified by investigations whether the problems have a physical cause.</seg>
<seg id="25">"who should go to sleep, and what happens?"</seg>
<seg id="26">"for an examination in the sleep laboratory, physicians advise for example with snoring with breathing dropouts, in case of disease-related tiredness, in case of sleepwalkers or if one does not find the cause of a disturbance, explains Fietze."</seg>
<seg id="27">It is not necessary to prepare for the examination.</seg>
<seg id="28">You should spend the day normally.</seg>
<seg id="29">"only do not take a nap," says Fietz. "</seg>
<seg id="30">"after the disguise, one goes to bed at his normal time."</seg>
<seg id="31">"in addition to the electrodes on the body, one carries a nose-goggles, a chest strap and a feeler at the finger."</seg>
<seg id="32">"in addition, a camera records the sleeping end at the ceiling."</seg>
<seg id="33">How can those affected get a grip on the problems?</seg>
<seg id="34">There are quite a lot of adjusting screws for better sleep.</seg>
<seg id="35">"Weaving counts on: regular sleeping and uploading times, not too long in bed, do not sleep on the day, do not watch TV to sleep, do not avoid smoking and at night do not look at the clock - then you start to reckon immediately, and that is absolutely not conducive."</seg>

<seg id="1">"old buildings, some linden trees, in between still a rest cobblestone pavement: the Riga street in Berlin-Friedrichshain doesn't look like at first sight, but the police are one of the" "dangerous places" "of the city."</seg>
<seg id="2">"walking along the road from east to west, one passes on playgrounds, a newly painted kindergarten and a bioladen."</seg>
<seg id="3">Someone "ugly!" jumped to the facade of a gray house.</seg>
<seg id="4">"in comparison to a Lidl, which is also to be demolished soon, it is already being built: until 2017 a house with high windows and 133 new apartments will be built here."</seg>
<seg id="5">"in recent weeks, articles about this" "trendy district", "as the responsible real estate company Friedrichshain, are still favored with burning cars."</seg>
<seg id="6">"the reason is the house with number 94: once it was occupied, meanwhile the residents have occupied apartment contracts, but on the ground floor there are still rooms occupied and are used for events."</seg>
<seg id="7">"since the beginning of the year, the Berlin inner senator Henkel has repeatedly called for a hard action by the police against the project, the area referred to as a" no-go zone "for policemen and the 94 as a starting point of autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="8">"on 22 June the rooms on the ground floor, the Cadterschmiede, with 300 police officers, patrol the police for three weeks, according to official statements with 30 to 40 officials and three crew wagons on site, locked parts of the road and stopped visitors from entering the house with number 94."</seg>
<seg id="9">"meanwhile, construction workers commissioned the rooms on behalf of the unknown homeowners."</seg>
<seg id="10">"on 13 July, a Berlin administration court ruled that the clearance had been illegal and a day later police and construction workers abandoned the jubilation of sympathizers and residents."</seg>
<seg id="11">"on this summer afternoon the road is peaceful: parents walk with children, people sit on the pavement in front of the houses in the sun, others are entertained before late i."</seg>
<seg id="12">In the immediate vicinity of the house projects there is a primary school and kindergartens.</seg>
<seg id="13">"left hand violence is not the main concern of many residents: Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been in the neighborhood since 1999, and Jana *, who plays three children here, are mostly stressed by the police presence."</seg>
<seg id="14">"with the inhabitants of the house projects, they share the concern of rising rents and ventrification."</seg>
<seg id="15">It does not sound like a Kiez who wished for several local police protection from the vandaliatory left.</seg>
<seg id="16">"the trench, which the Berlin inner senator and the police set up between house occupiers and their neighbors, obviously does not exist."</seg>
<seg id="17">"in contrast to the rest of the city, Friedrichshain in the East of Berlin was actually a traditional working-class district."</seg>
<seg id="18">"house occupations and the resulting housing projects have long been part of the neighbourhood: in 1990, numerous houses were occupied in the former GDR, including nearly the entire Mainzer Strasse in the vicinity of the Riga."</seg>
<seg id="19">"while the Mainzer was evacuated under a large police force in a regular street battle, many of the projects were legalized in the Riga and are still inhabited by the people who had occupied them 26 years ago."</seg>
<seg id="20">"at the same time, in recent years, the borough has become increasingly a magnet for tourists and pollers from all over the world."</seg>
<seg id="21">"this is also reflected in the rents, which have risen by almost 60 percent since 2009."</seg>
<seg id="22">"many of the newbuildings in Riga are being attacked as symbols for this development: they can be identified with wrapped slices or freshly painted facades, which were thrown with color bags."</seg>
<seg id="23">No other road was mentioned this year with the words "left-autonomous violence."</seg>
<seg id="24">"one reason for not seeing all of the neighbours as a problem might be that they are not necessarily affected by crime. according to statistics, criminal offenders like bodily injury are almost exclusively directed against policemen."</seg>
<seg id="25">"the majority of the offences make property damage, which tends to meet the newly built and newly renovated houses."</seg>
<seg id="26">"for Kerstin Neugebauer, who has been living in a tenancy house for 17 years next to the disputed 94, uncertainty cannot be made of uncertainty."</seg>
<seg id="27">"as for violence, it is weightless: the people in the 94 are their neighbors, they were not intended."</seg>
<seg id="28">Even the famous burning cars no longer exist in the Riga city anymore.</seg>
<seg id="29">"for the studied architecture, her road is not a criminal focus, on the contrary:" here one helps one another, lives together on the road and gets more of each other than elsewhere. "</seg>
<seg id="30">Neugebauer is deliberately drawn into the Riga street - and remained.</seg>
<seg id="31">"for this reason, it was also so important that the residents got their streets back: from the police, politics and the media, which suddenly claimed the interpretation sovereignty of the district in July."</seg>
<seg id="32">"however, in the eyes of residents such as Neugebauer, the road continues to be taken away: by faceless new buildings in former buildings, which push the old inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="33">"in the end, these are condominiums that are not interesting for many here - people who are not so well cared for," she says. "</seg>
<seg id="34">"I can absolutely not approve violence and destruction."</seg>
<seg id="35">But what should you do if you never listen to someone?</seg>
<seg id="36">"there is frustration on all sides, including the police and the inhabitants."</seg>
<seg id="37">"for those who are annoyed about color bombs, Kerstin Neugebauer has little understanding: the house projects and the left scene belonged to the neighbourhood."</seg>
<seg id="38">"who draws, should be aware of it - just like someone who pulls into a tavern district, can complain badly about noise there."</seg>

<seg id="7">"Regine customer of the working group suggests that the volunteers are more than grateful that Deuschle is now there, the hailing Wollmilksau, which above all has a problem."</seg>
<seg id="8">"in this way, some - less ridiculous than rather focused on the multitude of desired tasks - meant, when the administration wanted to write the passage."</seg>
<seg id="9">"looking for an administrative power with a talent for languages and people, combined with a long-standing experience in the field of social work, there was also an enmeshed wool milksau."</seg>
<seg id="10">"but administrative work is not her central area, Annika Deuschle writes."</seg>
<seg id="11">"above all, it is about organisation, work with local people and behind the scenes as well as network activities."</seg>
<seg id="12">The 31-year-old has been there for about six weeks.</seg>
<seg id="13">It has limited a 50 percent site to three years.</seg>
<seg id="14">"it was high time," says Regine Customer, that Annika Deuschle supports honest and full-time actors. "</seg>
<seg id="15">"there are big and small problems, organizational, human and communication problems."</seg>
<seg id="16">"soon, new containers will be placed in the waterway"</seg>
<seg id="17">It has been a serious problem for some time to find apartments for the connecting flights that have been recognized.</seg>
<seg id="18">The municipalities are responsible for the connection provision.</seg>
<seg id="19">They have to accommodate the refugees in their own or rented living spaces.</seg>
<seg id="20">"the cost of the construction, the rent or the renovation of these accommodations must be borne by the local authorities themselves."</seg>
<seg id="21">The responsibility changes from the District Office to the Commune and Jobcenter.</seg>
<seg id="22">"problem: there are free objects, but not every landlord wants to offer his apartment."</seg>
<seg id="23">The search has been very difficult for some time now.</seg>
<seg id="24">"de facto, administration does not find private apartments."</seg>
<seg id="25">"so far, it is not working, if one relies on private dwellings, so Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="26">"therefore, community dwellings must be intimidated as it is so beautiful."</seg>
<seg id="27">New containers will soon be set up in the Wasenstraße.</seg>
<seg id="28">But only with apartments it is not done.</seg>
<seg id="29">"perspective is the keyword, Regine customer and Annika Deuschle agree."</seg>
<seg id="30">"in addition to a permanent residence, there are internship placements, training places, school grounds, one-euro jobs and auxiliaries for refugees and migrants who have to be spotted or set up."</seg>
<seg id="31">"more places would be good," reports Regine customer. "</seg>
<seg id="32">"many work in the building yard or help house masters, do non-profit work - and that motivates and very tidy, as Annika Deuschle reports."</seg>
<seg id="33">It hopes that the work for the community leads to a positive external impact.</seg>
<seg id="34">"this is" "no employment therapy". ""</seg>
<seg id="35">But activity does not only mean work.</seg>
<seg id="36">"the day needs a solid structure, say Deuschle and customer."</seg>
<seg id="37">People would have to develop a sense of belonging.</seg>
<seg id="38">"so I need offers such as sports, contacts with locals and especially language courses."</seg>
<seg id="39">Professional courses are rare.</seg>
<seg id="40">"so, administration and honorary officials also jump here."</seg>
<seg id="41">It is central that the refugees get the feeling they are welcome and welcome in Germany.</seg>
<seg id="42">The long duration of the procedure is a problem.</seg>
<seg id="43">"they must explain to the refugees that it just takes and they can bridge the time wisely, for example with language courses."</seg>
<seg id="44">"who at some point develop the feeling that he can no one help in Urbach, do not work and be unprofitable, he will never be integrated."</seg>
<seg id="45">The clear majority is motivated.</seg>
<seg id="46">"the work of Deuschle and the customer is, therefore, always to motivate others."</seg>
<seg id="47">All this is already a mammoth task.</seg>
<seg id="48">"a difficult question: do the two have fear of radicalisation after the recent events, even in a small church such as Urbach?"</seg>
<seg id="49">"no," Regine customer says clearly, "what some may call naive." "</seg>
<seg id="50">But the helpers are already sensitized.</seg>
<seg id="51">These incidents are also subject to refugees.</seg>
<seg id="52">They would have the fear that the assassins killed them completely.</seg>
<seg id="53">"they want to show that they have nothing to do with it," "says Regine Customer."</seg>
<seg id="54">Many would like to stay in Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="55">So main and honorary officials have to look out for activities on the spot and in the region.</seg>
<seg id="56">They always have in the background that soon there could be a new push to refugees and migrants to Urbach.</seg>
<seg id="57">Does Germany need a upper limit?</seg>
<seg id="58">"to answer this question clearly, the policy eludes itself."</seg>
<seg id="59">"in fact, it is unfair to put them on the spot."</seg>
<seg id="60">"in Urbach, we haven't arrived where we want to go," "says Annika Deuschle."</seg>
<seg id="61">"no new refugees, this would be able to relax."</seg>
<seg id="62">Regine customer also makes clear that the Urbacher are already busy to integrate the previous people in a reasonable way.</seg>
<seg id="63">"these are currently around 100 people, mainly young men."</seg>
<seg id="64">"but if people are in need, they must help them, both women agree."</seg>
<seg id="65">"the political world situation is so complicated, there are no simple answers."</seg>
