Obama Rec@@ ei@@ ves Net@@ any@@ ahu
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu is not very friendly .
the two wanted to talk about the implementation of the international agreement as well as about Te@@ hr@@ an &apos;s dest@@ abili@@ zing measures in the Middle East .
&quot; during the meeting , however , the conflict with the Palestinians and the two @-@ state solution discussed . &quot;
the relationship between Obama and Net@@ any@@ ahu has been ten@@ se for years .
&quot; Washington den@@ oun@@ ces Israel &apos;s ongoing settlement construction , and acc@@ uses Net@@ any@@ ahu &apos;s lack of will in the peace process . &quot;
&quot; by the deal adverti@@ sed by Obama on Iran &apos;s nuclear program , the relationship of the two has deterior@@ ated further . &quot;
&quot; in March , Net@@ any@@ ahu announced a controversial speech at the invitation of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans in front of the US Congress , which was partly regarded as an aff@@ ront against Obama . &quot;
&quot; the speech was not discussed with Obama , a meeting had rejected this election in Israel with reference to the forthcoming election in Israel . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor is pleased to have shot his girlfriend . &quot;
&quot; in an emergency call , Professor Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb told me that he had shot up his girlfriend and that the officials had to come to his house . &quot;
&quot; lamb was important to emphasize that his &quot; sweet dog &quot; was still alive and probably excited , and he said the family contacts of the dead woman could be found on the mobile phone . &quot;
&quot; inside the house the officials found the corp@@ se of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss and a hand@@ written note , which was stuck on a white block : &quot; I am sorry , I wanted to reverse it , I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman who ever loved me . &quot; this was according to the authorities in the letter , and he was signed by Lamb . &quot;
&quot; there was no indication that Lamb who taught in two online courses for the Delta State University in Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , had already traveled 300 miles to the school grounds , where he killed and killed a popular history professor , E@@ than Schmidt , at the door to his office . &quot;
Delta State University police chief Lyn@@ n Bu@@ ford said university employees have heard shooting at 10 : 18 o &apos;clock .
he said that Lamb had made the fatal emergency call at some point later .
&quot; until the end of the day , there was another death : lamb took the life when the police en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; one day after the shooting at the university , the students and lec@@ turers forced to hide behind closed doors , the authorities still try to get a picture of what Lamb is motivated . &quot;
&quot; the details published by the investig@@ ators at both ends of the state , as well as what students and staff who knew him helped to draw a picture of a talented , but possibly difficult teacher . &quot;
students said they were looking forward to his lessons .
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , where Pr@@ enti@@ ss died , said he had no history of violence or a criminal pre@@ history . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt himself had mentioned Lamb in a book written by him , in which he mentioned the &quot; &quot; wonderful people &quot; &quot; with whom he shared his academic life . &quot;
&quot; both taught in the Department of Social Sciences and History , whose faculty comprises 17 members , and many students visited courses from both . &quot;
at the same time there were some inclin@@ ations to problematic behavior .
&quot; a student , Brand@@ on Be@@ a@@ vers , who praised Lamb , said he also seemed a little nervous and nervous as if something was wrong with him . &quot;
&quot; another student , Mik@@ el Sy@@ kes , said that Lamb had told him that he had to deal with stress at the end of the academic year 2014 @-@ 15 . &quot;
lamb had previously asked the Delta State University for health reasons and said that he has some health problem .
this year he taught only two online courses .
recent changes in the university &apos;s employment policy meant that the promotion that the Lamb had worked so hard for him would not be a guarantee for an automatic path to a position as Assistant Professor .
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
these are questions that Lamb cannot answer any more .
&quot; after the escape from the campus , the police found Lam@@ bs lane later , when he returned to Miss@@ issi@@ ppi from Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as . &quot;
&quot; before being arrested , Lamb killed herself with a .@@ 38 cali@@ ber gun in the back@@ yard of a house about one mile south of his home on the outskirts of Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , Washington County Cor@@ oner methane Johnson said . &quot;
his car was still in the dri@@ ve@@ way .
&quot; it was not immediately clear why he went to this house , but Johnson said they knew that he knew the people who lived there . &quot;
lamb grew up in the area .
&quot; lamb started his work at the university in 2009 , which has 3,@@ 500 students in a city with about 12.@@ 000 inhabitants and taught ge@@ ography and pedago@@ gy . &quot;
he completed his doctorate in pedago@@ gy in the spring .
&quot; one of his long @-@ time girl@@ friends called him intelligent , charism@@ atic and funny . &quot;
&quot; Car@@ la H@@ air@@ ston said she was 15 and lamb was 20 , when they met together by mutual friends . &quot;
&quot; she and her friends were in High School , and he was the cool older guy who tried to teach her the guitar playing for a few years . &quot;
he was the women &apos;s flock at that time .
&quot; all the girls were melting away when he was there , &quot; &quot; said H@@ air@@ ston , now 40 and lives in the Jackson subur@@ b of Brand@@ on . &quot;
lamb and p@@ enti@@ ss were obviously some time together .
&quot; in the emergency call , Lamb said , &quot; &quot; I killed my wife , &quot; &quot; but there was no certificate of a marriage . &quot;
&quot; they had a dog named Light@@ ning , who lived with them in the brick house adjoining a Ba@@ you in Gau@@ tier . &quot;
the police said that the dog was fine .
&quot; the ex @-@ husband of Pr@@ enti@@ ss , Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , said they were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but friends stayed and had a daughter who was 19 years old now . &quot;
&quot; she was totally destroyed by the ground , &quot; said O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en about his daughter . &quot;
she and her mother were absolutely best friends .
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he never met Lamb , but by his daughter Ab@@ ig@@ ail he heard that Lamb was interested in music and played blues . &quot;
lamb hit Pr@@ enti@@ ss when he and Ab@@ ig@@ ail appeared both on a summer @-@ fair three years ago .
later they played together the one or the other gig .
O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said his daughter writes and sings her own music .
Pr@@ enti@@ ss was a nurse who worked for various companies online .
&quot; Mike Sha@@ ffer , a bar@@ tender and sometimes entertainment coordinator at The Ju@@ le@@ p Room , a weak@@ ly lit bar near Gau@@ tier , said that he saw Lamb and Pr@@ enti@@ ss Night in the night of 5 September for the last time after Lamb had finished his guitar and harmon@@ ica play before a spar@@ se audience . &quot;
there was no sign that something was wrong .
&quot; just a happy couple , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
we were at the clearing and jo@@ king together .
I mean they both had a good sense of j@@ okes .
&quot; Schmidt , the dead professor , led the first semester seminar program and specialized in American natives and colonial history , said Don Allan Po@@ ch@@ ell , an English professor at school . &quot;
he was married and had three little children .
&quot; he studied at the Empor@@ ia State University in K@@ ans@@ as , and was President of his Fr@@ at@@ ernity and Stu@@ dents Committee . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday evening about 900 people attended the Delta State Campus in Cle@@ vel@@ and , including lec@@ turers , employees , students and members of the community at a candle light commem@@ oration ceremony . &quot;
&quot; Schmidt &apos;s wife Li@@ z and his brother Jeff Schmidt also participated in the vi@@ gil , while the university choir sang &quot; B@@ right Mor@@ ning Star &quot; and Ama@@ zing Grace . &quot;
the lessons will be resum@@ ed on Wednesday .
&quot; we try to move our students back &quot; , &quot; said La@@ for@@ ge . &quot;
the crisis is over .
this is a day of healing .
&quot; A@@ my and Ro@@ geli@@ o Soli@@ s reported from Cle@@ vel@@ and , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi . &quot;
&quot; Associ@@ ated Press Auth@@ ors E@@ mil@@ y Wag@@ ster P@@ ett@@ us in Green@@ ville , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , and Rebecca Sant@@ ana in New Orleans contributed to this report . &quot;
&quot; this story has been corrected to reflect that the police now says that Lamb had the emergency call after he shot Schmidt , and that he called Pr@@ enti@@ ss as his wife in his not@@ ch , but there is no indication that the two have ever married . &quot;
To@@ ys R Us plans to hire less workers for Christmas time
&quot; To@@ ys R Us says that there will not be so many Christmas season employees as last year , but the toy and baby products dealer says that he will give the current employees and seasonal workers a chance to work more hours . &quot;
&quot; the company said it plan to hire 40,000 people in stores and distribution centers across the country . &quot;
most jobs will be part @-@ time jobs .
the company said it will start with job interviews this month and the number of employees increases from October to December .
&quot; while the holidays are even months away , the Christmas business draws closer and companies are preparing to hire time workers to equip shops with employees selling , sending , and delivering products . &quot;
Michael J. Fox j@@ okes about his &quot; Date &quot; with Princess Diana
the premiere of &quot; Back to the Future &quot; was a great moment for Michael J. Fox .
it was also remarkable for personal reasons .
&quot; we sat in the theatre waiting for the roy@@ als , and I notice that the seat next to me is empty , and it becomes clear to me that Princess Diana will sit next to me , &quot; &quot; he said in a trailer for an upcoming documentary &quot; Back in Time . &quot; &quot;
the film begins and it comes to mind that I am away from a simulated paraly@@ sis and an arm length of being with the princess of Wales at a date .
&quot; back in Time , &quot; a documentary about Back to the Future , presents interviews with Fox , Le@@ a Thom@@ p@@ son and Christopher Lloyd as well as director Robert Z@@ em@@ eck@@ is and producer Steven Spiel@@ berg . &quot;
&quot; back for the Future &quot; premi@@ ered 30 years ago .
&quot; it really is for me , &quot; said Spiel@@ berg , &quot; un@@ disputed the biggest time travel film ever filmed . &quot;
&quot; back in Time &quot; will be available on VO@@ D , DVD and in selected cinem@@ as in October . &quot;
UN chief says there is no military solution in Syria
&quot; Secretary @-@ General Ban K@@ i @-@ moon says his response to Russia &apos;s enhanced military support for Syria is : &quot; &quot; there is no military solution &quot; &quot; of the conflict almost five years , and more weapons will only wor@@ sen violence and misery for millions of people . &quot;
&quot; the UN leader once again calls on all parties , including the shared UN Security Council , to unite and support inclusive negotiations on finding a political solution . &quot;
&quot; a press conference on Wednesday that he plans to meet the Foreign Ministers of the five permanent member nations of the Council - USA , Russia , China , Great Britain and France - on the ver@@ ge of meeting the Council of Ministers this month to discuss the situation in Syria . &quot;
&quot; he regre@@ t@@ ted that the spl@@ its in the Council and the Syrian people and the &quot; &quot; Regional Po@@ wers &quot; &quot; make this situation irre@@ conc@@ il@@ able . &quot;
&quot; Mr Ban called on the five permanent members to show the same solidarity and unity in dealing with the crisis in Syria , which they demonstrated in the achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran . &quot;
8 survey data showing that Donald Tru@@ mp is serious .
some have tried to brand him as a flop .
others have taken him off as a joke .
and some are waiting for a collapse .
&quot; but no matter how some Republi@@ can try to pull Donald Tru@@ mp from the top ranks in surveys , it hasn &apos;t worked ( yet ) . &quot;
&quot; ten of the last 11 national surveys showed Donald Tru@@ mp in the double @-@ digit range , and some begin to seriously wonder what it means for the chances of nom@@ ination of real estate mo@@ gul@@ s . &quot;
&quot; of course , it is still too early in the election period . &quot;
nobody claims that Tru@@ mp is likely to win the Republi@@ can nom@@ ination .
&quot; experts stress that at that time in 2011 , Rick Per@@ ry &apos;s leadership was given to the rising emergence of Cain , none of which even won a state in the nom@@ ination process . &quot;
and there are many reasons why he had to fight in a general election .
&quot; but out@@ si@@ ders such as J@@ eb &apos;s Super PA@@ C and the conservative economic group Club for Growth now recognise Tru@@ mp &apos;s per@@ sever@@ ance and start to drop their dollars , in order to overthrow it . &quot;
here are some current survey values suggest@@ ing that the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l is not just a temporary phase :
Tru@@ mp arbit@@ rar@@ iness values have revol@@ ved around 180 degrees .
&quot; shortly before Donald Tru@@ mp announced his candi@@ dat@@ ure in mid @-@ June , a survey of Mon@@ mouth University revealed that only two of ten re@@ public@@ ans saw the real estate mo@@ gu@@ l positive . &quot;
&quot; by mid @-@ July , it was 40 percent . &quot;
at the beginning of August it was 52 percent .
now six of 10 re@@ public@@ ans have a positive view of Donald Tru@@ mp .
about three out of ten say they have a negative opinion .
and these figures are in early states .
a Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac vote in I@@ owa states last week that 60 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans have a good opinion of Tru@@ mp .
two @-@ thirds of the GO@@ P voters would be happy with Tru@@ mp as candidates .
&quot; in a CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey last week , 67 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans said they were either &quot; &quot; thrilled &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; satisfied &quot; &quot; if Tru@@ mp was nominated . &quot;
&quot; only two of ten say they were &quot; &quot; angry &quot; &quot; if he were the candidate . &quot;
only Ben Car@@ son creates the same enthusiasm as Tru@@ mp ( 43 percent say they were &quot; thrilled &quot; vs. 40 percent say the same about Tru@@ mp ) .
the next one in enthusiasm ?
Marco Ru@@ bio with only 21 percent .
&quot; on the other hand , 47 per cent of Republi@@ can voters say they were &quot; dis@@ satisfied &quot; or &quot; upset &quot; if J@@ eb Bush , the favorite of the establishment , would be the candidate . &quot;
a majority of Repub@@ lic@@ ans sees Tru@@ mp Temper@@ ament not as a problem .
&quot; while Donald Tru@@ mp is critici@@ zed for his bom@@ b@@ astic and offensive statements , 52 percent of Irish voters believe that real estate mo@@ gu@@ l has the right temper@@ ament for a president , ABC News / Washington Post on Monday . &quot;
&quot; the same number is seen in the first electoral state of the nation , the state of I@@ owa , where the same 52 percent of the Repub@@ lic@@ ans think that he has the personality for a commander @-@ in @-@ chief , according to Qu@@ in@@ ni@@ pi@@ ac last week . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , 44 percent think that he does not have the personality to effectively carry out his office , and almost six out of 10 independ@@ ents say that his temper@@ ament is not fit into the White House , so ABC / Post . &quot;
Republi@@ can voters get used to the idea .
&quot; when they expose their hats , Republi@@ can voters keep Tru@@ mp for real . &quot;
&quot; if they are asked who wins the GO@@ P nom@@ ination , after a pol@@ l from CN@@ N / OR@@ C last week , four out of ten say that Tru@@ mp is the best bet . &quot;
this is a change since the time when four of ten at the end of July put their money on J@@ eb Bush .
complete disclosure : in the past GO@@ P voters did not have the clear@@ est crystal ball .
&quot; at this point in the final cycle , four out of ten re@@ public@@ ans thought that Rick Per@@ ry would win the nom@@ ination just 28 % for the final candidate Mit@@ t Rom@@ ney . &quot;
&quot; however , a variety of GO@@ P voters can view the Tru@@ mp campaign as plau@@ sible . &quot;
&quot; even if the Republi@@ can gathered for another candidate , Tru@@ mp is still beating anyone . &quot;
some experts point out that the spl@@ inter@@ ed field probably contributes to Tru@@ mp leadership while anti @-@ Tru@@ mp support is distributed to more than a dozen other candidates .
&quot; but a survey of Mon@@ mouth University in early September shows that in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race between Tru@@ mp and most other Republi@@ can candidates , Tru@@ mp has re@@ aped the majority support . &quot;
&quot; he has 15 points ahead of C@@ arly Fi@@ or@@ ina , ahead of Marco Ru@@ bio 14 points , ahead of Walker 15 points , before J@@ eb Bush 19 points and finally vor Rand Paul , John Ka@@ sich and Chris Christi@@ e 33 points . &quot;
it &apos;s a head @-@ to @-@ head race with T@@ ed Cruz .
the only candidate who beats him ?
Ben Car@@ son would over@@ take the entrepreneur with 19 points in a hyp@@ othe@@ tical head @-@ to @-@ head race .
a tight majority of Donald Tru@@ mp fans say they have formed their minds .
a new pol@@ l of C@@ BS / NY@@ T on Tuesday shows that only a little more than half of the voters who support Tru@@ mp say they have firmly forgiven their votes .
&quot; of course , much can happen to change that , and no one can really say never change the opinion . &quot;
46 percent said they leave the door open to switch to other candidates .
&quot; nevertheless , Tru@@ mp is the strongest competitor at the moment of the other out@@ si@@ ders , the neuro@@ surgeon Ben Car@@ son , but voters who say they have formed their opinion are twice as common for Tru@@ mp . &quot;
six of the 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say they agree with Tru@@ mp on immigration .
&quot; ever since Donald Tru@@ mp was in his election campaign two months ago , immigrants from Mexico called &quot; rap@@ ists , &quot; the immigration and pi@@ vot@@ al point in public discourse began in 2016 . &quot;
some are concerned that the bom@@ b@@ astic expression of Tru@@ mp would stop critical His@@ pan@@ o Americans from the Republi@@ can party and damage the re@@ orientation efforts .
&quot; but according to the new ABC / Post survey on Monday , six of the 10 Repub@@ lic@@ ans say that they agree with Tru@@ mp on issues of immigration . &quot;
&quot; so long as the immigration remains in the spotlight , it seems to do Donald Tru@@ mp as well . &quot;
fru@@ stration over the government climbs to new high@@ s .
&quot; Donald Tru@@ mp and Ben Car@@ son meanwhile accounted for about half of the support of Republi@@ can voters , especially their out@@ si@@ ders . &quot;
&quot; six out of 10 re@@ public@@ ans say in the new Mon@@ days pol@@ l of ABC / Post , they prefer a political out@@ sider than someone with government experience . &quot;
and they are angry with Washington too .
&quot; a survey conducted by D@@ es Mo@@ ines Register / Blo@@ om@@ berg in I@@ owa two weeks ago shows that three out of four I@@ owa re@@ public@@ ans are frustr@@ ated by the Republi@@ can in Congress , with 54 percent &quot; uns@@ atis@@ fied &quot; and 21 percent &quot; hell@@ ish anno@@ yed . &quot;
&quot; Munich , Sy@@ lt and Co . : the five most exclusive housing estates in Germany &quot;
here in the Hob@@ ook@@ en@@ weg is the most expensive residential complex - with a view over the Nord@@ se@@ ew@@ at@@ ts .
&quot; in the street , one square meter of a roof @-@ roof@@ ed house costs 7@@ 3,@@ 300 euros . &quot;
&quot; on Sy@@ lt , the range of objects is naturally limited , &quot; it says in the study - therefore the high price . &quot;
a new study shows in which special locations one square meter is most expensive .
&quot; of course , 18.@@ 70 euros per square meter for a student bu@@ de in Munich are not really little . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to Germany &apos;s top living venues , however , one price is like Pe@@ an@@ uts . &quot;
the real estate service provider Engel &amp; Völk@@ ers has published a ranking of the most exclusive German residential locations - with square meter prices in di@@ zz@@ ying heights .
&quot; there are several ten thousand Euros ni@@ x - per square meter , well noted . &quot;
but good who can afford it ...
by the way : Munich is no exception here as an exception .
champi@@ ons League : Bavarian dream start thanks to Müller and Got@@ ze
double Tor@@ cast in Pi@@ raeus : Bayern @-@ Star Thomas Müller has just one run .
a lucky hit by Thomas Müller gave the FC Bayern the way to a well @-@ deserved 3 : 0 at Olympi@@ ak@@ os Pi@@ raeus .
a sovereign pr@@ elu@@ de to the Champions League season .
&quot; the World Champion Thomas Müller and Mario Göt@@ ze gave a dream start to the &quot; &quot; Mission of Milan &quot; &quot; in the Hex@@ enk@@ essel of Pi@@ raeus . &quot;
the team of coach P@@ ep Guardi@@ ola won their tournament play in the Champions League at the Greek record champion Olympi@@ ak@@ os in hot atmosphere thanks to Müll@@ ers Double Pack ( 5@@ 2nd / 90@@ . + 2 ) and Götz@@ es hit ( 8@@ 9th ) ear@@ ns with 3 : 0 ( 0 : 0 ) .
&quot; the twel@@ fth string success in series is to be the first step towards the final on May 28th , 2016 in Italy , where Guardi@@ ola finally wants to bring the H@@ enk@@ el@@ pot@@ t to Munich in the third race . &quot;
&quot; with his 28th hit in the Champions League for Bayern management , mil@@ ler received good help from Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ gate Roberto , who made a f@@ lange thought of the world champion . &quot;
&quot; we will not under@@ estimate them , &quot; &quot; said Bavaria @-@ Captain Philipp L@@ ahm in front of the game at the Kar@@ ais@@ ak@@ is Stadium before 31.@@ 6@@ 88 hot @-@ bloo@@ ded fans - and the Munich @-@ based word . &quot;
they showed a concentrated and committed idea without shining .
&quot; Pi@@ raeus had won his recent six home games in the Royal class , including well @-@ known clubs like Manchester United , At@@ l@@ é@@ ti@@ co Madrid or Ju@@ vent@@ us Turin . &quot;
in 2011 Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund ( 1 : 3 ) also stum@@ bled .
&quot; but Bavaria , in seven European ac@@ up du@@ els with Greek teams , didn &apos;t want to be the next victim . &quot;
&quot; they went cour@@ age@@ ously , but often too resour@@ ceful in their offensive efforts . &quot;
&quot; the attacks were often initiated by game reloc@@ ation on the left side Douglas Costa , which rarely came through against former Braunschwei@@ ger O@@ mar E@@ lab@@ d@@ ell@@ a@@ ou@@ i . &quot;
Müller had more luck from the right when his flan@@ k was hit from the right half @-@ field in the left upper gate .
in the 6@@ 7th minute the World Champion promised the possible 2 : 0 .
the best occasions in half of one had Robert Lew@@ and@@ owski .
&quot; first , as Olympi@@ ak@@ os @-@ stri@@ ker ide@@ ye Brown suggested the Pol@@ es &apos;s header from the line ( 26 . ) . &quot;
&quot; then by direct pick@@ up , the go@@ al@@ keeper Roberto was par@@ ked with his knee ( 3@@ 5. ) . &quot;
&quot; although the Bav@@ arians had their usual domin@@ ating game , Pi@@ raeus simply could set needle stick . &quot;
but on door@@ keepers Manuel Neu@@ er there was forgiveness .
&quot; for example , when he drew a shot of Ide@@ a over the latte ( 5@@ 6th ) . &quot;
&quot; in front of him , Guardi@@ ola had to defend a quad@@ rup@@ ed with David Al@@ aba in the center next to Jer@@ ome Bo@@ at@@ eng who made it good . &quot;
&quot; Mario Göt@@ ze , after muscular problems back in the cabin , sat outside at first . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup hero gave the green light only after the final training , said sports director Matthias Sam@@ mer at &quot; Sky &quot; : &quot; whoever wants to make something different from it is already vi@@ cious . &quot;
&quot; also during the first change , Guardi@@ ola decided against him when he brought King@@ sley Com@@ an for the beaten Lew@@ and@@ owski ( 59@@ th ) . &quot;
&quot; Got@@ ze arrived late for Ar@@ tur@@ o Vi@@ dal ( 7@@ 6th ) and made it clear 13 minutes later , by El@@ f@@ meter , Müller was still on it . &quot;
before the game it was in the stadium to Kra@@ w@@ allen .
&quot; after a smaller group of partly mut@@ ed Bayern fans in their spect@@ ator block apparently had provoked the supporters of the host Pi@@ raeus with words and gestures , the security forces attacked and went against the Munich pend@@ ants . &quot;
at least one Bayern @-@ fan was injured from the stadium .
&quot; who smo@@ kes , has a higher risk of losing teeth &quot;
&quot; who smo@@ kes , har@@ ms not only the lungs , but also the teeth - that suggests a Potsdam long @-@ term study . &quot;
&quot; good news : if the risk is cancelled , the risk will fall quickly . &quot;
smokers have a significantly increased risk of losing their teeth early .
&quot; this is part of the long @-@ term study of an international research team , including several members of the German Institute for Nutrition Research ( DI@@ f@@ E ) in Potsdam . &quot;
&quot; compared to non @-@ smokers , smokers had the risk of losing their teeth early to 2.@@ 5@@ - to 3.6 times higher . &quot;
&quot; the scientists had observed more than 23,@@ 300 participants . &quot;
&quot; major causes of tooth loss are c@@ aries and inflammation of the gum , emphasizes the DI@@ f@@ E . &quot;
&quot; for this perio@@ don@@ ti@@ tis smoking is a risk factor , the authors stress . &quot;
&quot; therefore , the relationship between smoking and loss of teeth will result in more frequent gum infections in smokers . &quot;
it is not clear to what extent smoking increases the risk of tooth decay .
&quot; people who quit smoking could reduce their risk but within a short time , the researchers write in the &quot; Journal of Dental Research . &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , it could take over ten years until the endanger@@ ing again sin@@ ks to the level of non @-@ smokers , the author Thomas Dietrich explained from the English University of Birmingham . &quot;
&quot; one must persu@@ ade people to become non @-@ smokers , declared study manager H@@ einer Boeing by DI@@ f@@ E : &quot; smoking shor@@ tens the lifetime . &quot;
&quot; not to smoke is good for lung and vessels , and , according to our findings , also leads to good dental health until the old age . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , over 20 percent of the population aged 65 to 74 years have been affected by hel@@ pl@@ essness , the DI@@ f@@ E shared . &quot;
previous studies have already pointed out that smoking increases the risk of early loss of tooth decay .
the new long @-@ term study supports the findings .
&quot; arch@@ e@@ ologists come to Cologne , Rhein@@ u@@ fer , to the remains of late Anti@@ quity &quot;
&quot; for the repeated time , archaeological finds have been made on the right bank of the Rhine in Cologne . &quot;
&quot; near the building site for the new Rhine bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists of the Roman @-@ German@@ ic @-@ Museum have excav@@ ated skel@@ et@@ ons and remains of historical buildings , said museum director Marcus Trier on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; since the beginning of construction work on the Rhine , historians have been searching for so @-@ called ground monuments . &quot;
&quot; for all construction projects in the city district of Cologne , the museum is always referred to as a specialist for archaeological excav@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; in the third part of the Rhein@@ bou@@ levard , archae@@ ologists have now found it . &quot;
&quot; from text documents it was already known that in the place in the 4th century a fortress and in the 8th century had stood a church , explained Trier . &quot;
&quot; in addition to rem@@ nants of the fortress and the church tower , a cemetery with around 350 graves was discovered , which probably belonged to the church . &quot;
young woman caught by freight train
&quot; after a young woman embark@@ ed on the train station in the l@@ urch , the federal police asks the people for help . &quot;
&quot; on the early Wednesday morning at 1.@@ 40@@ am , the woman crossed the railway station at the end of the platform and was captured by a freight train coming from Mön@@ chen@@ glad@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; due to the acquisition of the train , it has borne serious injuries to the Federal Police . &quot;
she was treated with emergency medical care and brought to a hospital by ambul@@ ance personnel .
&quot; over the reason of the noc@@ turn@@ al crossing of the young woman , there are no knowledge of the intermedi@@ ary officials . &quot;
the incident was possibly observed by witnesses or residents have heard acoustic percep@@ tions .
&quot; residents or pass@@ ers @-@ by from Lin@@ der@@ ner Bahn , Ziegel@@ straße , Thom@@ as@@ hof@@ strasse and Lei@@ ff@@ ar@@ ther Straße ( L@@ 3@@ 64 ) come into question . &quot;

EU Commission proposes new court in dispute on TTIP
&quot; to intensi@@ fy the dispute over the planned trans@@ atlan@@ tic free trade agreement , the European Commission has proposed a comprehensive reform of the current arbit@@ ration system . &quot;
&quot; the controversial private arbit@@ ration facilities for disputes between corporations and states should therefore be replaced by a more transparent system , which in its function corresponds to more traditional dishes . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we want to set up a system that citizens trust , &quot; &quot; declared the responsible Commissioner Ceci@@ lia Malm@@ ström in the performance . &quot;
the Swedish proposed to introduce the proposal as a European negotiating position in the Free Trade talks with the United States .
the German government announced support .
TTIP aims to create the world &apos;s largest free trade zone with 800 million people .
the plans to reform the current arbit@@ ration proceedings stipul@@ ate in con@@ cre@@ t@@ ely that the EU states and the US jointly choose independent judges for a new court of investment .
&quot; they should come from equal parts from the EU , the US and third countries . &quot;
&quot; for the first time , a second instance is scheduled for the first time . &quot;
it would allow it to appeal against jud@@ gements .
&quot; so far , the parties involved agree with each other on refer@@ ees , there was no objection to their judgments . &quot;
&quot; in the discussion of the past months , it has become clear that citizens not familiar with the old IS@@ DS system in fair@@ ness and justice , Malm@@ ström commented . &quot;
&quot; in the long term , it wants to work towards an international investment court . &quot;
&quot; there may be disputes between Chinese companies and EU states , for example . &quot;
the investor @-@ state arbit@@ ration proceedings ( IS@@ DS ) demanded above all by large corporations are considered one of the main reasons for the great resistance in Europe against TTIP .
&quot; traditional arbit@@ ration tri@@ bun@@ als are critici@@ zed by opponents as a kind of parallel justice , to drive compensation from tax@@ pa@@ yers , negotiate national laws or enforce a reduction in consumer and environmental standards . &quot;
&quot; in the first statements , anti @-@ TTIP organizations such as Camp@@ act have cited the European Commission &apos;s proposals as inadequate . &quot;
it was especially critic@@ ised that they should not apply to the already negotiated F@@ TA agreement with Canada ( C@@ eta ) .
&quot; on the other hand , the German Minister for Economic Affairs , Matthias Mach@@ ining ( SPD ) , described the plans as a great advance . &quot;
the Commission considered essential points in the reform that the Federal Minister of Economic Affairs Sig@@ mar Gabriel had worked out in the spring with other EU trade ministers .
the old system of private arbit@@ ration courts is from the table .
the French government also welcomed Malm@@ ström &apos;s plans .
the European Business Association warned against limiting the business opportunities of the economy by too many new rules .
especially small and medium @-@ sized enterprises could be dis@@ advant@@ aged by doing so .
&quot; when the talks on the TTIP ( Trans@@ atlan@@ tic Trade and Investment Partnership ) trade agreement can be concluded , it remained unclear on Wednesday . &quot;
the negotiations have been underway since mid @-@ 2013 .
&quot; however , the topic of investor protection has not yet been discussed with the US . &quot;
&quot; originally , a framework for the agreement should be at the end of this year . &quot;
this date is considered to be no longer sustainable .
delicate Folk from Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens in Hamburg
&quot; eleven years ago , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens sits on stage at the Cologne Prime Club ( today : Lux@@ or ) . &quot;
&quot; next to him is a fli@@ p@@ chart , on which the shy @-@ acting folk singer recorded the picturesque US state Mich@@ igan with felt pen . &quot;
&quot; the whole audience , about 40 people , is almost seized by St@@ ev@@ ens lecture . &quot;
&quot; he tells the story of various places , which he repeat@@ ed@@ ely records on the map , about which his min@@ u@@ zi@@ ously and delic@@ ately arranged songs report . &quot;
&quot; where they arose and how it looks there , in his homeland . &quot;
&quot; since then , St@@ ev@@ ens has proved to be a wonderful creative Ir@@ rer . &quot;
&quot; with the 2003 and third album &quot; Gre@@ etings from Mich@@ igan : the Great Lake State , &quot; clever@@ ly composed songs seem to be harmon@@ i@@ ously close to American folk in the late 1960s , but can always drift into great opul@@ ence at any time . &quot;
&quot; the rum@@ our arises , &quot; &quot; Mich@@ igan &quot; &quot; would be the first part of a dar@@ ing series : each of the 50 states of the states should be held in a row . &quot;
&quot; but already in 2004 and near the Rhine , &quot; Seven S@@ wan &quot; has already appeared and has a positive outlook . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ ens will be reduced here .
live with him guitar and ban@@ jo .
&quot; one year later , the musician , living in New York , returns to the series . &quot;
&quot; in 2005 , &quot; Il@@ lin@@ ois &quot; ( &quot; Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens Inv@@ ites You To : come on Fe@@ el The Il@@ lin@@ oise &quot; ) appeared in 2005 a nationwide celebrated masterpiece . &quot;
super@@ l@@ ative of ideas and styl@@ istic fin@@ esse .
the album entered the US Bill@@ board charts and is missing in any list of music media .
&quot; after extremely productive experiments , St@@ ev@@ ens then uses &quot; The Age of Ad@@ z &quot; ( 2010 ) very extensive electronic offset fragments . &quot;
&quot; this sixth studio album is still widely orchest@@ rated , but performed by programmed sequences or beats and plays with all kinds of effect and rever@@ b . &quot;
&quot; long since the smaller clubs came out , the stage shows here become a colorful spectacle of ne@@ on end bands and large fluorescent stage de@@ co . &quot;
&quot; currently , Su@@ f@@ jan St@@ ev@@ ens is touring Germany as part of a five @-@ member band . &quot;
in the dark ham@@ burger Hamburger More !
&quot; he mainly presents the &quot; &quot; Car@@ rie &amp; Low@@ ell &quot; &quot; available since March . &quot;
&quot; although here almost 2000 guests are sitting in their chairs , the far more mature St@@ ev@@ ens returns to in@@ timacy and to folk . &quot;
&quot; without a word to the audience , the group of excellent musicians is playing through the broad@@ ly enriched album . &quot;
&quot; one hears from the audience : the lecture is &quot; &quot; opul@@ ent &quot; &quot; and one can therefore throw away the &quot; &quot; record &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; only after an en@@ core , St@@ ev@@ ens thank@@ ed humble , plays acousti@@ cally few older songs and finally bows down under thunder@@ ous applause . &quot;
Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ ns debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister
Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s debut at the Prime Minister &apos;s Fra@@ cture has been anticipated with suspen@@ se since his election
the new Labour leader Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n is said to have made his debut at the premiere of the Prime Minister and set up for the first time with David Cameron .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will rise to ask the first of his six pre@@ determined questions shortly after noon while his performance is likely to be examined by the media and the Labour MEPs .
he called for &quot; less theater and more facts &quot; at this weekly event .
he also said that he could skip several meetings to leave them to colleagues .
&quot; the meeting will be the first parliamentary test for Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s leadership , because after his appointment as a member of the Shadow Cab@@ inet and his speech at the TU@@ C Conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , the decision of the Labour leader to remain silent on Tuesday during the commem@@ oration of the 7@@ 5th anniversary of the Battle of Britain in silence , has provoked criticism of a number of T@@ ory @-@ MPs and is at the heart of several pages of titles in the newspapers . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s decision not to sing the national an@@ them has attracted attention
&quot; a spokes@@ man by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said he had &quot; &quot; stood in respect@@ ful silence &quot; &quot; and he accepted the &quot; &quot; hero@@ ism of the Royal Air Force in the Battle of Britain &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; but a member of Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns Shadow Cab@@ inet , O@@ wen Smith , told the Labour leader to sing the national an@@ them , &quot; regardless of his belief that the monarchy should be abol@@ ished . &quot;
&quot; nearly a dozen of shadow mini@@ stries have refused to serve in Mr Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s top team , and they are called upon differences in the economy , defence and foreign policy , while less than a sixth of the parliamentary party originally supported him as a leader . &quot;
the Political correspon@@ dent of the BBC Robin Bran@@ t says that political differences are also within Labour &quot; and by Mr Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s statements on the position of the European Union and the limit in profits .
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said the TU@@ C conference that Labour changes to remove all the idea of a limitation altogether .
&quot; hours later Mr Smith , the shadow @-@ working and pensions minister said that the party is &quot; very clear &quot; that it is only against government plans to lower the limit of € 26@@ ,000 to 23@@ ,000 pounds . &quot;
Mr Cor@@ by@@ n will be the fifth Labour leader David Cameron ever since he is a T@@ ory leader and over the last decade over the Dis@@ patch box across the Parliament .
&quot; the Labour leader , who has promised a different set of policies , says that he has &quot; Crow@@ d @-@ sour@@ ced &quot; ideas for questions to Mr Cameron and given him more than 30,000 suggestions . &quot;
&quot; Is@@ ling@@ ton North MP has said that the prime minister &apos;s fragment is too confron@@ t@@ ative , and that he is subjected to serious problems such as poverty , inequality and challenges for young people . &quot;
&quot; Mr Cor@@ by@@ n said that Angela Eagle , the shadow economic minister is represented in him , if he does not participate - for example when Mr Cameron is travelling abroad . &quot;
&quot; he also brought the idea into conversation that other colleagues occasionally take the word , and that he addressed John Ber@@ cow , the speaker of the House , to discuss the problem . &quot;
&quot; when he became a leader in 2005 , Mr Cameron said he wanted to remove himself from politics in the style of a &quot; j@@ ester theatre , &quot; which is often associated with the prime minister &apos;s fragment . but a few years later he admitted he failed . &quot;
&quot; since it was first aired on television in 1990 , the question was viewed with the prime minister as the most important bar@@ ometer of the ruling of a leader and his position among his parliam@@ ent@@ arians , although critics have argued that it has become a car@@ ic@@ ature and would require far @-@ reaching reforms . &quot;

pound rises through accelerated growth in the UK
&quot; the pound rose by le@@ aps according to data , which indicate an increase in the United Kingdom &apos;s wage growth . in parallel , the FT@@ SE 100 was increased by the bid goal SA@@ B@@ Miller . &quot;
&quot; between May and July , earnings without bonuses in the United Kingdom increased by 2.@@ 9 % over the same period of the previous year . &quot;
this percentage was the fastest and most calculated estim@@ ation over the time of an increase in interest .
&quot; the pound rose by more than 1 % against the dollar to $ 1,@@ 5@@ 50@@ 5 and climbed up to 0.@@ 84 % against the euro to 1,@@ 37@@ 30 € . &quot;
&quot; the FT@@ SE 100 Index closed with an increase of 1,@@ 49 % to 6,@@ 2@@ 29@@ ,@@ 21 . &quot;
SA@@ B@@ Miller was the outstanding share in the market and made a 20 % jump after taking over the offer of the Ri@@ val AB In@@ Be@@ v .
&quot; a transaction would combine the two largest bre@@ wer@@ ies in the world and bring brands such as Bud@@ weiser , Stella Ar@@ to@@ is , Per@@ oni and Gro@@ l@@ sch together . &quot;
&quot; following encouraging news from the competition group for luxury goods , Bur@@ berry shares were 0.@@ 9 % higher . &quot;
Rich@@ em@@ on@@ &apos;s latest sales figures beat all expectations and also showed that sales in China - a key market for Bur@@ berry - re@@ port@@ edly reported growth .
&quot; shares of Gl@@ en@@ core rose by 5 % , after the mining giant said that he took 2.5 billion dollars through a stock sale as part of his strategy of reducing debt . &quot;
&quot; the shares of Mon@@ di &apos;s packaging and paper company were the biggest los@@ ers on the index , with a decrease of 4.3 % , after Gold@@ man Sach@@ s made his estim@@ ation for the company rating on &quot; &quot; sell &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; J@@ D Sports rose by 3.1 % , after the sports complaint company reported a pre @-@ tax result of 4@@ 6.@@ 6 million for the half @-@ year . &quot;
the chief of J@@ D Sports says higher wages end@@ anger expansion .
the managing director of J@@ D Sports Peter Cow@@ g@@ ill says that a higher minimum wage for UK workers could mean &quot; more purchasing power in the pockets of potential customers . &quot;
&quot; but it is unlikely that this purchasing power will compensate for the higher labor costs in his company , he says . &quot;
&quot; the costs could meet the expansion plans of J@@ D Sports , he added , and that could mean that there are less additional jobs . &quot;
J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber in the capital : on the Bie@@ ber expedition in Berlin
&quot; J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber , Meg@@ ast@@ ar . &quot;
&quot; hi@@ pp@@ ische 21 years young , a hanging with above @-@ lay@@ ered fr@@ ise . &quot;
the type with plat@@ inum bl@@ ond hair is 100 million euro hard .
more even more .
Mon@@ si@@ eur Bie@@ ber is currently in Berlin .
and the generation U@@ 17 spins .
like Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a Ru@@ d@@ zin@@ ska .
the 15 @-@ year @-@ old has never heard the name &quot; R@@ itz Carl@@ ton . &quot;
not bad .
hundreds of fans accompanied J@@ ustin yesterday .
among them E@@ wa and Vik@@ tori@@ a from Poland .
&quot; since 7 o &apos;clock in the morning , however , the Pol@@ in sits on the cold stone plates of Berlin &apos;s luxury hotel on Pots@@ dam@@ er Platz . &quot;
&quot; the Bie@@ ber construction : here you live i@@ dol , whose posters hang in St@@ et@@ tin , since Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; the suite in which the Canadian singer lives , costs exactly as much on the day as her mo@@ m E@@ wa deserves in half a year . &quot;
if at all .
&quot; that says , &quot; &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , my Wi@@ k@@ tori@@ a would have to sit in the tenth grade in the grammar school . &quot;
&quot; I fill her a dream . &quot;
compulsory education ?
who is it@@ ching ?
the fans don &apos;t .
even Bie@@ ber itself is not .
this has taken care of anyway .
&quot; for the advertisement in the commercial break of the super@@ charged player he scored three million , a two @-@ year deal with an anti @-@ p@@ im@@ p company washed many , many dollars on the Bie@@ ber account . &quot;
&quot; and with every doll that looks like he goes and goes over the counter , Bie@@ ber also collects . &quot;
when J@@ ustin Bie@@ ber drinks a coffee one wonders at the wind@@ screen .
he is said to have captured more than 100 million .
some say the hyp@@ e is too far .
others stress that Bie@@ ber was finally in the US and Great Britain with his new single &quot; What do you mean ? &quot; at number 1 .
&quot; Bie@@ ber himself , whose fourth album is to follow in November , is not interested in the many zer@@ os . &quot;
at least he does so .
PE@@ G@@ ID@@ A poster brings Lebanese to m@@ ashed idea
potatoes or D@@ ön@@ er ?
&quot; both - and in the potato crow@@ er , which the Ol@@ den@@ burger I@@ mb@@ ach owner Han@@ i Al@@ hay developed . &quot;
&quot; inspired by the slogan &quot; Pot@@ ato instead of D@@ ön@@ er &quot; on a poster of the Pe@@ gi@@ da movement , Al@@ hay has put potato and meat together on a sk@@ ewer . &quot;
&quot; the idea brought him a poster at a Pe@@ gi@@ da demonstration with the inscription &quot; Pot@@ atoes , instead of D@@ ön@@ er , &quot; which he had seen acci@@ dentally on television . &quot;
&quot; since then , in his shop there is a barbecue , which is equipped with meat and potatoes . &quot;
&quot; this is Mul@@ tik@@ ul@@ ti for the stomach , &quot; says Al@@ hay . &quot;
the Lebanese authorities have now submitted the idea to the Munich Patent Office .
&quot; according to the authority , it has recently been protected as a utility model . &quot;
&quot; as much meat and how much potatoes the sk@@ ewer contains , Al@@ hay is therefore not willing to betra@@ y . &quot;
&quot; just as much : &quot; it tastes even better together , &quot; he finds . &quot;
culinary international understanding is also good for its customers .
Met@@ cash starts the soil @-@ resistance campaign to combat aging
Met@@ cash tries to protect the I@@ GA branch from an Al@@ di @-@ rise in South Australia and Western Australia .
food wholesale Met@@ cash has launched a sustainability campaign to defend the market share of I@@ GA retailers in South Australia and Western Australia ahead of a 700 million $ Al@@ di invasion .
&quot; while Al@@ di is preparing the opening of two sales centers and the first 120 shops in South Australia and Western Australia early next year , Met@@ cash and I@@ GA supermarkets strengthen their relationships with local food suppliers and build the I@@ GA brand through mainstream marketing and marketing across the social media , as well as events such as Adel@@ ai@@ de show . &quot;
&quot; Ig@@ A traders and suppliers are jumping on board , with brands such as iron manufacturer S@@ imm@@ o from D@@ uns@@ bor@@ ough , which distri@@ butes samples in I@@ GA stores and shop owners who sell cheaper tickets for the South Australian Football League to loyal customers . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Met@@ cash will release further details of its defense strategy on September 29 , when the wholes@@ aler for food , alcohol and equipment performs its annual investor strategy day . &quot;
&quot; there is a lot in the game , as South Australia and Western Australia account for almost 30 percent of Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA retail stores and generate higher profit margins as a Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s I@@ GA network in the eastern states . &quot;
&quot; purch@@ as@@ ers in South Australia and Western Australia are not@@ ori@@ ously provincial and I@@ GA retailers have a much stronger market share than in New South Wales , Victoria and Que@@ ens@@ land - more than 30 percent in South Australia and 24 percent in Western Australia compared to around 14 percent in eastern countries . &quot;
&quot; analysts like Morgan Stan@@ ley believe that Al@@ di will grab some five percent of the food market in these two states after opening its first markets , and will take away all existing actors , but mainly independent retailers . &quot;
&quot; according to a report published this week , the analy@@ st Tom K@@ ier@@ ath of Morgan Stan@@ ley estimated that I@@ GA retailers could lose 360 $ million turnover per year and Met@@ cash 250 million $ by the end of 2016 . &quot;
this pro@@ g@@ nosis is based on the assumption that Al@@ di opens 25 branches in SA and 30 in WA in the next year and will generate revenues of $ 500 million and $ 600 million in each market .
&quot; the loss in the food and food business and at the Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s high fixed cost basis could cost around 13 million $ profit before interest and taxes , Mr K@@ ier@@ ath said . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , Met@@ cash loses market shares in the eastern states , mainly Al@@ di and Col@@ es , although a recent survey conducted by Roy Morgan found that I@@ GA buyers are the most loyal . &quot;
Morgan Stan@@ ley believes that Met@@ a &apos;s sales and food business will fall by 3.@@ 8 percent in 2016 by 4.1 percent in 2017 and 2.1 percent in 2018 and will reduce market share of 14 percent in 2015 to 10.@@ 3 percent by 2020 .
&quot; last week , the leading fund manager Ham@@ ish Dou@@ glass , founder of Mag@@ ell@@ an Financial Group , told me that Met@@ cash will likely disappear within a decade . Met@@ cash will disappear . &quot;
Met@@ cash declined to respond publicly to Mr Dou@@ glass &apos;s comments .
but it is assumed that a board member of Met@@ cash contacted Mr Dou@@ glass last week .
&quot; since 2010 , i@@ gas market share has dropped from 18 percent to 14 percent , and revenues from Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s Food and Food trade , which has approximately 1,@@ 200 I@@ GA retailers , have fallen by 43 percent since 2012 , reflecting the reduction in operating debt on sales and margins at the same time . &quot;
&quot; wholes@@ al@@ ers do however , and invest more than $ 150 million to match col@@ es and Wo@@ ol@@ wor@@ ths in hundreds of products each week to improve their stores by growing faster fresh foods and delivering a better selection of private label foods . &quot;
&quot; Met@@ c@@ ash@@ s &apos;s chief executive director Ian Mor@@ rice says that the price adjustments and charging programs are set to El@@ an , hoping that for the first time in 2017 , the wholes@@ aler will return to profit growth for the first time in four years . &quot;
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is is supported by the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly
Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is deserves praise rather than criticism for his behaviour .
&quot; Th@@ an@@ asi Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was one of the &quot; col@@ lateral damages &quot; in the recent storm around his friend Nick Kyr@@ g@@ and , according to the President of the Australian tennis association Steve He@@ aly , deserves praise as a cri@@ tique for his own behaviour . &quot;
&quot; Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is , the younger of the talented du@@ os , which is repeatedly called &quot; Special K@@ s , &quot; came into the spotlight with the famous confrontation of Kyr@@ gio with St@@ an Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka . &quot;
&quot; soon afterwards , in a fi@@ ery qualification game in C@@ inc@@ inn@@ ati , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is and his opponent R@@ yan Har@@ rison had to be separated twice by the refer@@ ee , with Har@@ rison proclaimed : &quot; &quot; Wa@@ wr@@ in@@ ka would have to beat Kyr@@ g@@ ums , and I should beat the child . &quot;
&quot; while he was last seen how he sm@@ ashed a tennis ra@@ cket , after a cra@@ mp promised a potential US Open @-@ win by Richard Gas@@ quet , Kok@@ kin@@ ak@@ is was defended by He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; the teen@@ ager is currently in Glasgow , competing with Sam Gr@@ oth for second place in the singles behind Bernard Tom@@ ic in the Davis Cup semi @-@ fin@@ als against Great Britain . &quot;
&quot; one thing I &apos;m quite excited about is the fact that after my opinion Th@@ an@@ asi was drawn a little into the argument , &quot; &quot; He@@ aly said . &quot;
&quot; he has broken a ra@@ cket when he lost a fight in the US Open , but he is not the first player who has broken a ra@@ cket of fru@@ stration with himself , and I know Th@@ an@@ asi well enough to know that he is not proud of it . &quot;
&quot; but , really , he beha@@ ved extremely well in the US Open even under the rather pro@@ voc@@ ative circumstances with Har@@ rison and so on , and I think he deserves much recognition . &quot;
&quot; he has a great team around him , he has a great family around him , and I think he was treated a little too strictly . &quot;
&quot; he is a very mature 19 @-@ year @-@ old , he works very hard , and he fits into the team and so on , he has never been a problem with the other players , he is well in shape , he is a very stable and mature young guy , and I think he deserves to be judged according to his own mer@@ its . &quot;
&quot; He@@ aly also supported the decision to refrain from taking into account the important preliminary decision which starts on Friday , and he describes the &quot; common decision &quot; as the right one for all , but he sec@@ ures the man from Can@@ ber@@ ra as a long @-@ term solid component to return to the team . &quot;
&quot; first we want the team to be completely focused on the competition and not all around the controversi@@ es around &#91; Kyr@@ g@@ ols &#93; , &quot; said He@@ aly . &quot;
&quot; he climbs in the eyes of the public , and he has made some bad mistakes and deserves all the criticism he gets , but we try to help him understand the consequences of his actions . some time outside the li@@ mel@@ i@@ ght , in which he can only think about it , I consider appropriate , and it is best for the team and it is best for him . &quot;
&quot; Europe &apos;s refugee crisis : Hungary declares emergency status , closes the border , with@@ holds refugees &quot;
Hungary declares the state of emergency and sm@@ iled the southern border with Serbia on Tuesday and held all those who tried to illeg@@ ally enter the country . everything with the aim of stopping the influ@@ x of migrants .
chaos followed the border when hundreds of migrants were accum@@ ulating in a Ni@@ em@@ and@@ s@@ land and re@@ acting Ser@@ b officials with indignation .
&quot; for an unknown time , the people who had fled from violence were stuck in a strip on the road between the two control points of the countries and built tents and settled there . &quot;
but frustr@@ ations got up .
&quot; as a police helicopter g@@ lim@@ mer@@ ed over them , the migrants &quot; &quot; open the border ! &quot; &quot; and shou@@ ted insul@@ ts against the Hungarian police police . &quot;
some rejected food and water protests .
&quot; Serbia &apos;s foreign minister declared it &quot; unacceptable &quot; that migrants from Hungary would be sent back , while more and more from Macedonia and Greece arrive . &quot;
( Serbia ) wants to be part of the solution and not a col@@ lateral damage .
&quot; talks with Brussels and other countries will have to take place in the coming days , &quot; &quot; said I@@ vica D@@ ac@@ ic in Prague . &quot;
the turbul@@ ence on the Hungarian @-@ Serbian border reached a day after the 28 @-@ Nations bloc at a stringent meeting in Brussels that no common immigration policy could be reconc@@ iled .
&quot; however , the ministers agreed to share responsibility for 40,000 people seeking refuge in the corrupt Italy and Greece . they expressed their hope that finally - next month or by the end of the year - an agreement would be reached that the EU states would include more 120@@ ,000 refugees , including some from Hungary . &quot;
German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austria called on a special summit of the European Union on Tuesday to discuss the continent &apos;s immigration crisis .
&quot; however , Hungary did not put its hopes on a swift action from Brussels or its neighbors . &quot;
&quot; the emergency status , which was proclaimed on Tuesday in two southern regions , gave authorities more powers to cope with the crisis so that they could block roads and speed up asylum procedures . &quot;
&quot; the Hungarian Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said that his country also plan to build a bar@@ bed wire fence along its border to Romania , in order to stop the influ@@ x of migrants from the country after it has ended a fence on the Serbian border . &quot;
C@@ BS News correspon@@ dent Charlie D &apos;@@ Ag@@ ata reported that even prison in@@ mates were employed in the race to create the bar@@ bed wire fence between Hungary and Serbia .
&quot; in recent months , Hungary has become a major bot@@ t@@ len@@ eck for many war refugees from Syria and elsewhere in the Middle East and has become an entry point in the European Union . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; however , Prime Minister Viktor Or@@ ban has insi@@ sted that most incoming economic refugees are looking for a better life , and not war refugees who claim protection - a view strongly opposed to other EU states , including Germany . &quot;
&quot; the new laws , which came into force at midnight in Hungary , make the crossing of the border or the damage of the 4 @-@ meter ( 13 feet ) tall fence that the government built along the southern border to Serbia , to a crime . these laws also establish higher prison sentences for convic@@ ted traffi@@ ckers . &quot;
&quot; due to the situation created by mass migration , the Hungarian government declares the emergency state , &quot; said government spokes@@ man Z@@ ol@@ tan K@@ ov@@ acs re@@ port@@ edly in the southern city of Sz@@ eg@@ ed . &quot;
we say it very clearly : illegal border crossing is a crime .
&quot; the Parliament must still agree on the use of the military , which is expected next week but re@@ porters from Associ@@ ated Press have already seen heavily armed soldiers with vehicles and dogs for days . &quot;
&quot; Gy@@ or@@ gy Bak@@ on@@ di , country security advis@@ er to Or@@ ban , said that the authorities knew 45 people trying to cross the border , 15 others had already penet@@ rated the country . &quot;
they come here by damaging the fence ; they are now in police custody and are accused of comm@@ itting crimes under the new laws .
authorities are going to repair the fence quickly .
&quot; on Tuesday morning , Hungarian officials also closed two of the seven border cross@@ ings with Serbia , having arrived with bar@@ bed wire to close the borders . &quot;
&quot; chaos circum@@ navig@@ ated the main border crossing near Ros@@ z@@ ke , Hungary , when Hungary opened a small office in a metal container to process the data of people and squee@@ ze a crowd to sit down there . &quot;
&quot; about 20 managed to arrive , but thousands remained outside . &quot;
another group of migrants blocked the main motorway connection between Serbia and Hungary and said they would refuse food and water until they travel to Hungary .
election 2016 : H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s head ahead of Ber@@ nie S@@ anders in national survey hal@@ ved
&quot; former US Secretary of State H@@ illary Clinton continues to hold a double @-@ digit lead in the democratic race for the nom@@ ination at national level , but Senator Ber@@ nie S@@ anders wins her across the ground . &quot;
&quot; Clinton now has the support of 47 percent of the Democratic voters in the pre @-@ election ( 58 percent before ) , while S@@ anders is second , with 27 percent ( rise by 17 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; vice @-@ president Joe Bi@@ den , who has not yet announced that he is can@@ did@@ ly presi@@ ded over for the presi@@ dency , receives support from 15 percent of the democratic elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries . &quot;
&quot; more than five months before the start of the elections , most democratic voters say it is too early to say that their opinion is determined which candidate they will support . &quot;
but Clinton &apos;s supporters are more consistent in their election than those of the other candidates .
&quot; since the C@@ BS @-@ News Survey , Clinton has lost a number of demographic groups while S@@ anders achieved some gains . &quot;
Clinton has a big lead in women and moder@@ ates but these projections have less@@ ened .
&quot; your support with the men has decreased significantly , and S@@ anders is here only with 5 points back . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s advantage in democratic elec@@ tors under the age of 50 has evap@@ or@@ ated and they and S@@ anders are now at the same level .
&quot; Clinton , however , still has a big advantage with the older voters . &quot;
&quot; last month , Clinton had a double @-@ digit lead in the Liber@@ als before S@@ anders , but S@@ anders now has a 5 @-@ point lead in this group . &quot;
about half of the elec@@ torate &apos;s democratic elec@@ torate say that they would support Clinton with enthusiasm if they were nominated by the party .
a quarter would support it with some reservations and another 15 percent would only support it because it is the candidate .
six percent would not support them .
perhaps not surprising that Clinton &apos;s current supporters are particularly enthusiastic about her .
the views are more mixed with those who are not currently supporting Clinton - only about a quarter would support them enthusi@@ astically .
&quot; while 48 percent of the Democratic voters say that they support Clinton with enthusiasm , less Republi@@ can voters say this about their top candidate Donald Tru@@ mp ( 35 percent ) . &quot;
&quot; if Clinton &apos;s supporters are asked in an open question why they want them to be the candidate , the most common answer is that she has the right experience ( 16 percent ) , followed by the view that it is time that a woman is president ( 13 percent ) and that she is the best candidate for the job ( 10 percent ) . &quot;
Clinton &apos;s supporters also mentioned her connection with Bill Clinton ( 9 percent ) .
agreement to deal with the problems and the elec@@ tivity is also cited .
&quot; as the Vice President throws a potential for the presidential office in the scales , 57 percent of the democratic voters want to see him in the race - although a third believes he should not do it . &quot;
&quot; if democratic constitu@@ ents of the prim@@ aries are asked who would be their second choice for the party , Bi@@ den is at the head . &quot;
Clin@@ ton &apos;s supporters say more than half that Bi@@ den would be their second choice far from S@@ anders .
&quot; if Bi@@ den decides not to fight for the nom@@ ination of the demo@@ crats , H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s advance in front of S@@ anders is increased from 20 points with Bi@@ den in the race to 30 points without him in the race . &quot;
&quot; fifty @-@ five percent of the Democratic voters see Clinton as a candidate with the best chances to win the election , but this figure has fallen by 78 percent last month . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den is by far a second in this measurement , but the percentage that sees it as the &quot; &quot; sel@@ ectable &quot; &quot; has risen . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless , in the question of what is more important for a candidate , Democratic voters call questions about elec@@ tivity . &quot;
&quot; just like last month , no single democratic candidate or potential candidate for these elec@@ tors of the prim@@ aries emerged as unacceptable . &quot;
the Democratic candidates or potential candidates provide good results with some important features of voters in the pre @-@ election of their party .
&quot; Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den consider maj@@ orities to be honest and trust@@ worthy and with strong leadership qualities . &quot;
&quot; Bi@@ den cuts best with hon@@ esty among the three candidates , while Clinton &apos;s strength is the lead . &quot;
&quot; thirty percent of democratic voters do not believe that Clinton is honest and trust@@ worthy , twice as many say that about S@@ anders ( 15 percent ) , but 27 percent do not think of him . &quot;
&quot; the democratic elec@@ torate of the prim@@ aries generally also see Clinton , S@@ anders and Bi@@ den ide@@ ologically in agreement with their views . &quot;
&quot; for all these measurements , about one quarter of the Democratic voters has no opinion of S@@ anders . &quot;
&quot; as questions about H@@ illary Clinton &apos;s use of a personal e @-@ mail address and a server remain as foreign minister during the term of office , most of the Democratic voters of the prim@@ aries are satisfied with their explanation of the matter and say that it has not influenced their opinions altogether . &quot;
but it is a different story in the American public in general .
&quot; half of the Americans are now dis@@ satisfied with their declaration , while only one third is satisfied . &quot;
&quot; public opinion was split in March , shortly after the problem came to light . &quot;
&quot; most Americans said that the e @-@ mail controversy had no impact on Clinton &apos;s general opinion , although 36 percent said that their opinion of it has deterior@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; they are mainly Repub@@ lic@@ ans , more than six out of 10 who say their views from Clinton have become worse . &quot;
&quot; although Clinton is considered honest and trust@@ worthy by the voters of their party , this continues to be a problem for them among registered voters in total : only 32 percent see them as honest and trust@@ worthy , eight percent less than last month and 15 points less since May . &quot;
62 percent of those entitled to vote do not hold them for an honest and trust@@ worthy person .
&quot; at the same time , 55 percent of voters see Tru@@ mp as being honest and not trust@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; however , Clinton and Tru@@ mp have good music scores . &quot;
&quot; from the six tested candidates , Bi@@ den , Car@@ son and Bush best cut hon@@ esty . &quot;
&quot; a majority regards S@@ anders rather than honestly , but as with Car@@ son many don &apos;t think of him . &quot;
the fault rate for the sample of 3@@ 51 Democratic voters in the pre @-@ elections amounts to 6 percentage points .
Ben Car@@ son moves closer to Donald Tru@@ mp on a nationwide survey
Ben Car@@ son is close behind Donald Tru@@ mp at the latest C@@ BS News / New York Times pol@@ l
&quot; in the meantime , half of the voters &apos; support in the new pol@@ l has fallen on both candidates , and others are losing their grip . &quot;
&quot; Republi@@ can voters continue to support Tru@@ mp in large numbers nationwide . the support is growing from 23 % in the last C@@ BS survey carried out last month , 27 % in the Tuesday survey . &quot;
but Car@@ son dropped from 6 % to 23 % in the same period .
&quot; the survey also revealed that Car@@ son is well received by demographic groups , and Tru@@ mp is sur@@ passing Republi@@ can voters with university education . &quot;
&quot; the rest of the field , with the exception of C@@ oot Fi@@ or@@ ina and Ohio governor John Ka@@ sich , is kno@@ cked off with Wis@@ cons@@ ins Gover@@ nor Scott Walker , who fell at the deepest , with 10 % support last month to now 2 % . &quot;
&quot; former Gover@@ nor J@@ eb Bush , former Gover@@ nor of Ar@@ kan@@ s@@ as Mike Hu@@ ck@@ abe@@ e and Florida Senator Marco Ru@@ bio are in third place . &quot;
the error margin in the sample of 3@@ 76 people of Republi@@ can voters in this latest survey is Plus or Min@@ us 6 % and was carried out in September .
&quot; the latest CN@@ N / OR@@ C survey , published last week , shows that Car@@ son is rising in the p@@ olls - with 19 % support for the Repub@@ lic@@ ans , behind the Tru@@ mp with 32 % support . &quot;
the latest pol@@ l of ABC News / Washington Post showed Tru@@ mp significantly ahead of Car@@ son .
&quot; with a look at a Car@@ son rising over the last week , Tru@@ mp found some si@@ ps for the former neuro@@ surgeon , even after Car@@ son ap@@ ologi@@ zed to question Tru@@ mp &apos;s belief . &quot;
&quot; we need energy , &quot; said Tru@@ mp last Saturday during a campaign show in I@@ owa . &quot;
pleasant bathing temperatures : the eastern Mediterranean is currently up to 29 degrees warm .
&quot; even if peak values are measured only in the distance , a trip to the Mediterranean is enough for bathing vac@@ ation@@ ers to find even warm water . &quot;
a bath in the North or Baltic Sea should be a rather short pleasure with a maximum of 17 degrees .
&quot; some people no longer go to the sea : a maximum of 18 degrees has the water in the North and Baltic Sea this week , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) shares . &quot;
&quot; bathroom temperatures , on the other hand , continue to offer the Mediterranean : in the east it even gets up to 29 degrees . &quot;
&quot; in the Adriatic it is at the top 25 degrees , in France 23 degrees . &quot;
the Red Sea in Egypt comes to 28 degrees .
five members of the Brotherhood are bur@@ dened with the death of a Bar@@ uch College new@@ bie
&quot; almost two years after a student died during a student connection in Po@@ con@@ o Mountains , Pennsylvania , murder charges against five people were submitted . &quot;
&quot; members of the New York Bar@@ uch College P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood attacked Ch@@ un &quot; Michael &quot; Den@@ g during an introduction ritual in September 2013 , and delayed his transport to the hospital , which contributed to his death , the police shared . &quot;
&quot; officials said he had been loaded with bound eyes with a 30 pound back@@ pack full of sand , and repeatedly attacked while he tried to go over a frozen field to a destination . &quot;
&quot; Mr. Den@@ g finally compla@@ ined about head@@ aches , then he fell unconscious . &quot;
&quot; the members of the P@@ i @-@ Delta @-@ P@@ si Brotherhood did not call the calling number 911 , after Den@@ g was power@@ less and supposedly waiting for an hour before they brought him to a hospital , so the police . &quot;
&quot; however , they had the time to change D@@ eng@@ s clothing , goo@@ gling his symptoms and to contact Andy Men@@ g , the national president of the Brotherhood in order to get advice , police chief Chris Wagner said at a press conference . &quot;
&quot; at this point , the members began to hide the utensils and set the welfare of the Brotherhood princip@@ ally by Michael Den@@ g , &quot; &quot; said Poli@@ mark@@ ef Wagner . &quot;
&quot; he could not be revi@@ ved , and he died the next morning at his injuries . &quot;
&quot; after an aut@@ op@@ sy report , Den@@ g was repeatedly added with mu@@ te force injury to head , tor@@ so and thi@@ ghs . &quot;
&quot; too many families were destroyed by the ch@@ ic@@ ans of the Brotherhood . at least one student died every year since 1970 , &quot; said Douglas Fi@@ er@@ berg , a lawyer representing the D@@ eng@@ s family in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; br@@ other@@ hoods and their members must be held ac@@ countable , and this step by authorities is very important . &quot;
a County Grand Jury of Mon@@ ro@@ e recommended an indictment for the third rank of murder for the first five members .
&quot; thirty @-@ two members of the Brotherhood , including Mr Men@@ g , are also charged with criminal attacks and formation of a criminal association . &quot;
&quot; we do not only want to take responsibility for the people involved , but if there is an organisation which - official or un@@ official - has sanc@@ tioned this , we will also hold them to account , &quot; &quot; said Wagner at a press conference on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; Bar@@ uch College has banned the Brotherhood , and the National Fr@@ at@@ ernity has rev@@ oked its affili@@ ation with the local group . &quot;
this will happen when the F@@ ed increases interest rates
&quot; an increase in interest is coming , and the household will get bank@@ rupt , yields for bonds will rise , and the economy will slip into recession . &quot;
we know this .
what we do not know is how long it will take and how long it will stop .
&quot; in particular , the history of the economy offers only a small guide to the process . &quot;
a recession came within just 11 months after the first rate of interest and lasted 86 months .
&quot; the aggres@@ si@@ veness of the Federal Reserve when raising interest rates is often , if not always , a factor in how the economy and financial investments react . &quot;
&quot; therefore , representatives of the US Central Bank have stressed so sharply that investors should not focus on when it begins to increase the interest rates , but rather on the period required for normal@@ isation . &quot;
&quot; in fact , several variables play a role . &quot;
&quot; in the end , market participants could however find that all the excitement was possibly exagger@@ ated due to an increase in interest . &quot;
&quot; the first increase in the F@@ ed since the global financial crisis will inevitably be interpreted by some as a signal for the end of the era of &quot; cheap money , &quot; said Julian Jes@@ so@@ p , chief econom@@ ist at Capital Economics , in a message to customers . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , we do not expect the gradual return of US interest to normal heights , but still at a low level to lead to sei@@ s@@ mic shock that many seem to fear . &quot;
&quot; however , this does not mean that there will be no impact . &quot;
here is a look at historic trends based on how some areas of the economy could react :
&quot; as the market has seen last month , anticip@@ ation of interest rate increases can be volati@@ le for a while . &quot;
&quot; as soon as the increase arrives , the influence is not so dramatic . &quot;
&quot; there seems to be a tendency that assets yield 12 to 24 months after the first increase , which perhaps reflects the delay in monetary policy , &quot; said Deutsche Bank analysts in a recent study on what happens after interest rate increases in the F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; more specifically , the market in the past 35 years is mostly in upward trend - about 14 percent - on the way to interest increase , rather flat in the 250 days after ( average gain of 2.6 percent ) , then back to normal state after 500 days , with an average return in the past six past cycles of 14.@@ 4 percent according to a recent analysis , published by Bob Dol@@ l , chief plant strateg@@ ist at Nu@@ ve@@ en Asset Management , at Bar@@ ron &apos;s . &quot;
Deutsche Bank said that the impact on the shares ten@@ denti@@ ally occurs later in the increase cycle and returns with it to decrease .
&quot; rec@@ essions are a fact of economic life , but interest increases often promote it . &quot;
&quot; in the current case , the F@@ ed is confronted with some conditions that did not exist before and which could accelerate a recession . &quot;
remarkable is the fact that the gross domestic product will be near its lowest point at a rate of interest of the F@@ ed .
&quot; according to Deutsche Bank , at 118 interest rate increases since 1950 only nominal GDP was below 4.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; although the second quarter of 2015 was 3.6 percent , only a few expect this to continue and expect only 1.5 percent for the third quarter according to the Atlanta F@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; interest increases in such a fragile economic backdrop could be ris@@ ky and raise the question &quot; &quot; whether this time is different , &quot; &quot; said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
&quot; market participants posted a net interest in the F@@ ed all year round , and all eyes were focused on the meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee this week , which ends on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; while many strate@@ gi@@ sts and econom@@ ists believe that the FO@@ MC could appro@@ ve an increase in this meeting , fut@@ ures trading only gives a chance of 25 percent . &quot;
&quot; in our study , all raising cycles from 1950 to this day have taken place in a super cycle with increasing momentum in GDP , and pre @-@ rec@@ es@@ sion@@ ists were put in the shade very quickly after the start of the recovery , &quot; says the report . &quot;
&quot; in contrast , this is a clearly slow recovery from what was the worst recession in the observed phase . &quot;
&quot; the current cycle is by far the longest one the F@@ ed has been waiting for since the end of the last recession ; the record was 35 months , and this has been 74 months . &quot;
&quot; fixed income was also volati@@ le , as the market anticip@@ ates an increase in interest , and the pattern is quite similar to the capital market . &quot;
the main difference is that the effect on bonds is quicker than when stocks change their strategic course .
bonds seem to change the direction as soon as the first increase / decrease in the cycle takes place .
&quot; at the end of the elevation @-@ cycle the bond yields fell immediately , said the Deutsche Bank . &quot;
Charles Sch@@ wa@@ b &apos;s strate@@ gi@@ sts believe that the rise in interest rates will lead to a closer cooperation between longer and shorter bonds and lead to a fl@@ atten@@ ing of the curve .
&quot; highly @-@ interest loans often bring better yields in such a climate , although &quot; we are still careful to expect higher yields , &quot; said Kath@@ y Jones , Fi@@ xed @-@ In@@ come analy@@ st at Sch@@ wa@@ b , in an analysis . &quot;
&quot; interest@@ ingly , Jones suggests that markets have already adapted to F@@ ed strategy expectations . &quot;
&quot; in addition to the strength of the dollar and the decline of inflation expectations , there are some indications that the market has adapted to the prospect of stric@@ ter monetary policy &quot; &quot; she wrote . &quot;
&quot; short @-@ term interest has risen , the yield curve is fl@@ atter , lending has expanded and volati@@ lity has risen - all the features of the market when the F@@ ed tigh@@ tened its strategy . &quot;
&quot; in the large and whole , companies that handle the greater part of their business operations in the US will benefit from this when interest rates increase and local products become more attractive . &quot;
&quot; multinational companies with high debts are becoming worse , as a rising dollar makes their products more expensive on the global market and also the financing of their debt . &quot;
&quot; history shows that &quot; quality &quot; shares tend to be extremely positive three months after an initial rate of interest , &quot; Gold@@ man Sach@@ s analysts said in a report for the customers . &quot;
&quot; firms with a strong balance sheet have sur@@ passed companies with weak balance after each of the interest increases in 1994 , 1999 and 2004 by 5 percentage points . &quot;
companies with high capital yields and low volati@@ lity on their shares also exceeded their counter@@ parts with low quality by an average of 4 ( percentage points ) and 3 ( percentage points ) .
debt becomes a big problem .
&quot; companies with a high share of flexible interest rates are most likely to lose , said Gold@@ man . &quot;
&quot; outside of pure equity , consumers will also benefit from the rising dollar . &quot;
&quot; savers could see profits by higher yields , even if experts of different opinions are how quickly that will take place . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 is a copy of Classic FM , says MP Andrew B@@ ingham &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative member of the Parliament critic@@ ised the broad@@ caster for its &quot; &quot; stup@@ idity &quot; &quot; &quot;
he ar@@ gues that he is increasingly not distingu@@ ishable from commercial ri@@ vals .
he was also referring to the BBC Music Awards and said that they only im@@ itated The Br@@ its
&quot; Parliament colleague Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins took the broadcast &quot; &quot; The Voice &quot; &quot; and said it was not very original . &quot;
&quot; BBC Radio 3 &quot; turns into Classic FM , &quot; maintains a leading member of parliament and raises new pressure on the broad@@ caster to prove that he does something that the private broad@@ cast@@ ers do not . &quot;
&quot; the Conserv@@ ative MP Andrew B@@ ingham also said the BBC @-@ bos@@ ses that the public broad@@ caster &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; and increasingly no longer distinguished from its commercial competitors . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 seems - I don &apos;t like to use the word &quot; &quot; stupid &quot; &quot; - but it seems to turn to Classic FM , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
he was also referring to the BBC Music Awards that started last December .
&quot; the BBC Music Awards , which started last year , seem to be The Br@@ its just under a different name . &quot;
&quot; so if you are trying to do something else - these are two spontaneously named examples where you can only im@@ itate what is already on the market , &quot; Mr B@@ ingham said . &quot;
BBC General Director rejected the alle@@ gations and argued that BBC Radio 3 was far ahead of its commercial competitors when it comes to live music and inform@@ ing the public .
what I learn from Radio 3 I &apos;m going to learn about classical music anywhere else .
and there is a commitment to live music and music that is really uns@@ ur@@ passed .
&quot; and the commitment of Radio 3 to find new music and put new works on commission , I really think is important , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this year , BBC Radio 3 Contro@@ ll@@ ers Alan Dav@@ ey argued that he had to work harder to engage the audience than it did in the past because the British were less informed about classical music . &quot;
&quot; radio 3 , however , was not the only element of BBC production , which , during the hearing in the Committee on Culture , Media and Sport , came under fire to tramp@@ le over the commercial ri@@ vals . &quot;
&quot; the T@@ ory MP Dam@@ ien Col@@ lins gra@@ bbed The Voice - the BBC &apos;s musical talent show , which was bought by Dutch producer Tal@@ pa Media for an estimated cost of £ 22 million . &quot;
do you see why this program is often discussed because it is not original and not particularly striking ?
Lord Hall insi@@ sted that the BBC 1 show - with Pal@@ oma Faith and Boy George as a judge - was produced in particular BBC way .
&quot; he added that he wishes that the company &quot; &quot; find a hit from our in @-@ house stable &quot; &quot; when the next time there is a series of entertainment . &quot;
&quot; however , he refused to en@@ close the order from other series of The Voice in the future or to spend money from the fee pa@@ yers for other entertainment formats . &quot;
net sales were slow@@ ed down in August and Black Friday can be responsible for this
&quot; in the first three months of 2015 , there were seven percent increase in online sales . &quot;
last month there was the lowest score since the beginning of the records in 2000
online sales increased three years ago by using mobile phones for shopping
experts believe that Black Friday has slow@@ ed its spending in November
&quot; for over a decade , virtual shopping has been bo@@ oming and many of Britain &apos;s main shopping streets have turned into ghost cities . &quot;
&quot; however , experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent in the first three months of 2015 . &quot;
total expenditure on August presented the lowest rise in growth since the beginning of the record in 2000 with only five percent increase compared to the previous year .
experts say that there are signs that online sales stagn@@ ate after new figures only showed seven percent growth in the first three months of 2015
&quot; if you look at the growth rates for the previous years and go back to 2000 , this has always been developed over time , &quot; said Andy Mul@@ c@@ ah@@ y , publisher of the IM@@ R@@ G sales script for the Guardian . &quot;
&quot; he explained that online sales increased three years ago , when buyers began to make purchases with their mobile phones . &quot;
&quot; it meant that more people could shop online and that people could do this in different environments , e.g. at home on the sofa . &quot;
&quot; but now that is sw@@ inging , and we may experience that growth is dimin@@ ishing . &quot;
the Black @-@ Friday phenomenon imported from America is cited as a reason for the decreasing turnover .
&quot; experts believe that buyers will hold their purchases in front of this event , which will take place on the last Friday in November . &quot;
&quot; last year , five times the average number of buyers turned around their computers to make their bar@@ gains , and some dealer sites crashed . &quot;
&quot; experts believe that Black Friday , in which the buyers were fighting for bar@@ gains , could prevent buyers from making purchases . &quot;
a study by the British Retail Con@@ sortium found that £ 5 was issued a little more than £ 1 online .
&quot; for some products such as television and washing machines , more than one third of shopping is now being carried out via web shops . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , more than a quarter of men buy clothes and shoes online rather than in the fashion stores in the inner cities . &quot;
Muslims buried in Mec@@ ca at the Cran@@ e accident Get@@ away - Bin Laden &apos;s family is sanc@@ tioned
the corp@@ ses of 29 dead are carried by Muslims in the first funeral par@@ ables in Mec@@ ca through the streets
Saudi Arabia hal@@ ves the collapse of some of the huge Saudi @-@ bin Laden group
&quot; the Ministry of Health said that in addition , a total of 3@@ 94 people were injured after the crane collap@@ sed &quot;
hundreds of Muslims congreg@@ ated when 29 of the victims were carried by the streets to bury those killed when a crane crashed in Mec@@ ca &apos;s mega @-@ mosque .
&quot; mour@@ ning , largely dressed in white , the route to pay their respect , when the first of the dead came their last trip to the Al @-@ Renaissance cemetery . &quot;
&quot; the funeral procession passed on to the holy place , where only days before a construction crane broke through the mosque &apos;s ceiling and then fell on the bed@@ side . &quot;
&quot; the corp@@ ses were released for the funeral , when the Saudi king over the construction company of the Bin Laden family because of the disaster that also left 3@@ 94 injured , suspended a san@@ ction . &quot;
the corp@@ ses of 29 worshi@@ ppers killed when a crane r@@ ushed through the Great Central mosque of Mec@@ ca were carried by the streets .
&quot; among the dead was Q@@ asi@@ m Ak@@ ram from Bol@@ ton , Greater Manchester , the father of four children who were on his first pilgrimage to assist the crane . &quot;
Mr Ak@@ ram was with his parents before the beginning of the annual H@@ add@@ ling in the Great Mos@@ que .
&quot; Saudi officers have already stated that the p@@ add@@ ling will continue to Mec@@ ca , with thousands , who will continue to go to the city . &quot;
&quot; today King Sal@@ man , the Bin Laden group , said that the arm of the crane should not have been stopped when he was not used . &quot;
&quot; an Arabic version of the decree , published by the Saudi Press Agency , said that the Bin Laden group was responsible for the collapse . &quot;
&quot; the news agency &apos;s English @-@ language service did not report this detail , but said that the company &apos;s leadership was banned abroad . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of this week , Sal@@ man had to reveal what caused the fall of the crane , which fell into a courtyard of the mega @-@ mosque , where hundreds of thousands of Muslims were assembled in front of the H@@ add@@ ington , which was later this month . &quot;
&quot; the Bin Laden group did not publish any statements about the collapse of the crane , and its representatives were not available for a statement . &quot;
the Royal Dec@@ ree also ad@@ ored the group because of not current security measures and because they did not cooperate with meteor@@ ologists .
dozens of cranes surround Mek@@ ka Groß@@ mo@@ sch@@ ee as part of the massive building project managed by the Bin Laden group .
Ben Laden &apos;s family has been associated with the Saudi royal family for decades and takes over larger projects .
&quot; the dec@@ eased leader of Al Qaeda , Os@@ ama bin Laden , was a rebel@@ li@@ ous son , who was ex@@ propri@@ ated by the family in the 1990 @-@ s . &quot;
&quot; the crash of the crane came in the midst of heavy winds and rain , only a few days before the arrival of millions in the Kingdom for the pilgrimage , which at least once in the life of every healthy Muslims is required . &quot;
officials said that 158 people remain in the hospital .
government officials ruled that 1 million Ri@@ al ( £ 17@@ 4.000 ) were to be paid to the members of the killed and the same amount of permanently injured .
other wounded will receive half of this amount .
B &amp; Q Boss predic@@ ts that the time of the cheap East European tra@@ des@@ man is over
&quot; British employ more and more arti@@ sans , says Ver@@ oni@@ que Lau@@ ry &quot;
the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe has increased
&quot; this means that 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops , aimed at tra@@ des@@ people , will be opened &quot;
at the same time King@@ f@@ isher will close 60 B &amp; Q outlets nationwide
&quot; by Ru@@ pert St@@ einer , City Chief correspon@@ dent of the Daily Mail &quot;
&quot; it is alleged that British sett@@ ling their h@@ amm@@ ers and brushes in favour of the use of skilled Eastern European arti@@ sans who carry out work in their homes , &quot;
&quot; if you can deal with a hammer or a brush to paint walls , you seem to belong to a minority nowadays . &quot;
&quot; the British are increasingly employing arti@@ sans to carry out do @-@ it @-@ your@@ sel@@ fers in their homes , thus the head of the company behind B &amp; Q . &quot;
&quot; Vé@@ ron@@ ique Lau@@ ry , the new Managing Director of King@@ f@@ isher , who has the building markets chain , said that a large increase in the number of skilled craftsmen from Eastern Europe , offering services at low prices is now obsol@@ ete . &quot;
&quot; therefore , King@@ f@@ isher plans to open 200 other Scre@@ w@@ fix shops aimed at arti@@ sans and close to 60 outlets from B &amp; Q . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said she wanted more women in B &amp; Q shops because eight out of ten buying decisions were made by women .
&quot; at the moment , the men out@@ weigh the men . &quot;
she said it was necessary to face the growing demographic trends that show more female single households who make more renov@@ ations than in the past .
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; there is still a majority of men in our branches .
&quot; &quot; &quot; we need to shift this more towards a balance . &quot;
&quot; in principle , half of our customers consist of women with 80 percent of the decisions on the purchase of articles by women . &quot;
women play a major role in the decision @-@ making process .
&quot; Mrs Lau@@ ry , who is one of only five women at the head of a British company listed in the FT@@ SE@@ 100 Index , has also set up her top team to reflect an equal number of men and women in manag@@ erial positions . &quot;
&quot; King@@ F@@ isher is almost the only company occupying 50 per cent of the team with women , including its management and CFO . &quot;
Mrs Lau@@ ry said : &quot; this was a conscious decision - diversity is an important topic here .
it was not difficult to find good women for our Supervisory Board .
King@@ F@@ isher reported a drop in the half @-@ year profit and turnover after the Group ow@@ es the cost of closing the shops .
&quot; due to the trend , King@@ f@@ isher , the Scre@@ w@@ fix and B &amp; Q , will open 200 new stores . &quot;
officials of A@@ ich / D@@ ob due to in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity in court
&quot; on Wednesday two function@@ aries of the Austrian volleyball runner , A@@ ich / D@@ ob , have to be responsible for in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity and spending . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not guilty .
one of them was also accused of abuse of office .
he has been acqu@@ itted by this accus@@ ation in May .
the current trial was ad@@ jour@@ ned .
&quot; according to the tor@@ ney @-@ attorney Robert Ri@@ ffel , the preliminary investigation revealed that the defend@@ ants were using funds from the association &apos;s accounts in the years 2006 to 2011 , which they were allowed to disp@@ lace in their functions for private purposes . &quot;
&quot; he de@@ cip@@ her@@ ed the damage with some 400@@ ,000 euros . &quot;
the sports function@@ aries are also indic@@ ted for financial failures .
&quot; this fact was the chairman of the Sch@@ öff@@ en@@ sen@@ ate , judge Micha@@ ela San@@ in . &quot;
it should be negotiated at a later date .
&quot; for the rejection of in@@ fi@@ del@@ ity , the defence argued that at no point did the association develop an asset . &quot;
&quot; the sports function@@ aries would have charged only reimbur@@ sement damages and the sports club , for which they had been active from 1982 to 2011 , and in which they had invested a lot of time and money out of debt - the pas@@ siv@@ ity amounted to around 600@@ ,000 Sch@@ ill@@ ings ( approx . 4@@ 4.000 Euro ) in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; at that time we were faced with the situation : do we carry on or block the club ? &quot; &quot; one of the defend@@ ants , in the bread@@ cru@@ mbs of large firms of the financial district , said . &quot;
with his colleague and co @-@ accused he decided to take over this task .
with all risks .
&quot; we have shot money , swe@@ ating our life insurance as security at the bank , &quot; &quot; he said during the arrest . &quot;
&quot; the association has been agreed : you can manage the money freely , there must be no debt . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , in the case of appropriate financial success , the withdrawal of the expense allowance has been decided retro@@ actively by 1991 . &quot;
&quot; therefore , one part of the expense allowance was paid out only years later , namely from 2003 , when a plus was on the account . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , even l@@ ump and not detailed accounts appeared , the former chairman explained the processes . &quot;
&quot; the accounts and as@@ par@@ ag@@ ories were administered jointly by the two defend@@ ants , said the second defend@@ ant . &quot;
&quot; why the withdraw@@ als were not disclosed in detail , asked the judge . &quot;
&quot; the association did not concern itself in detail for the financial planning , it was important to have only the freedom of debt , so the answer . &quot;
&quot; when in 2011 against the one official investigation , an amount of 120@@ ,000 euros was transferred to the Club &apos;s account . &quot;
&quot; these were appropri@@ ations , declared the defend@@ ants . &quot;
&quot; this securities account ran on the name of the second defend@@ ant and , according to his statement , was not known to the association . &quot;
&quot; why ? &quot; &quot; the judge wanted to know . &quot;
the respon@@ dent did not know for a long time .
then he thought he had believed that this was the best thing for the club .
&quot; if something had happened to him , nobody would have known anything of this money , the prosec@@ utor presented in the room . &quot;
the co @-@ defend@@ ant was informed that the function@@ ary justified itself .
&quot; this bank transfer was formulated as &quot; &quot; damage compensation &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; why damage compensation ? , judge and prosec@@ utor wanted to know . &quot;
&quot; the first defend@@ ant , however , declared that he did not agree with this wording , because the association was never damaged . &quot;
&quot; but what should I do if the lawyer says , &quot; &quot; With him you are all out of the tailor . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; am I a lawyer ? &quot; &quot; he asked . &quot;
&quot; furthermore , the function@@ ary said he never paid a cent salary , he simply reck@@ oned mil@@ eage and di@@ eting . &quot;
&quot; he added 1,000 euros per month to the club , but the actual expenditure was much higher , he added . &quot;
the defend@@ ants were not able to submit exact documents for the early years .
&quot; these were no longer kept after an operating test in which everything had been judged correctly , they declared . &quot;
mil@@ eage was also related to the second defend@@ ant .
&quot; all the hang@@ ings were made in cash , so that he must go to Blei@@ burg from his place of residence to the bank , he explained in his statement . &quot;
the main hearing will be continued on 23 September with the interro@@ gation of witnesses .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard st@@ alls more 30.000 jobs
&quot; in addition to the workforce breakdown which has been running for three years , the Compu@@ terri@@ ese will cut further jobs in the spl@@ itting up of the company . &quot;
the sub@@ stan@@ cies in the US computer terri@@ esen H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard ( HP ) do not end .
&quot; as part of its restructuring , the US technology group plans to reduce the reduction of 25,000 to 30,000 points in its corporate divisions . &quot;
&quot; as a result , costs of 2.7 billion dollars ( 2.4 billion euros ) were to be saved , the company announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the step will lead to a special burden of around $ 2.7 billion , which will fall from the fourth quarter . &quot;
&quot; the exploitation of 55@@ ,000 jobs has not yet been completed for three years . &quot;
&quot; at the end of the 2013 / 14 financial year , HP employed some 30@@ 2,000 associates . &quot;
&quot; in the after@@ market , the H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ share was 2.3 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Group , which has grown up with printers from California &apos;s Pal@@ o Alto , is currently spl@@ itting up : this means that the computer and printer business will be bund@@ led in a new company - separate from the more promising areas with computer servers and data storage for companies and other services . &quot;
both business parts are to be listed on the stock exchange .
a once again dis@@ ap@@ pointing PC sales and a weaker demand from corporate clients according to its services was the second largest PC manufacturer in the world after Lenovo last .
&quot; in the third quarter of July , sales of PC and printers declined by 11.@@ 5 percent . &quot;
sales fell by 8 percent to just under EUR 25.@@ 4 billion .
&quot; in this way , revenue declined in 15 out of 16 quarters . &quot;
HP responds with a spl@@ itting up and massive sub@@ stan@@ cies on changes in the industry .
the 76 @-@ year @-@ old company under the leadership of Me@@ g Whit@@ man has re@@ acted very late that customers are increasingly buying smartphones and tablets instead of conventional computers and getting more and more businesses online .
&quot; in total , Whit@@ man &apos;s restructuring plans are seeing a total of around 55@@ ,000 jobs . &quot;
conflicts : majority supports anti @-@ IS training mission
&quot; however , a direct participation of German soldiers to combat operations in Iraq would mainly result in rejection : 54 per cent said that 35 percent were appro@@ ving . &quot;
the fact that other states are flying air strikes against the IS in Iraq and Syria are 61 percent positive .
&quot; however , 24 percent are opposed to interven@@ ing in the conflict . &quot;
&quot; a cooperation with the Syrian authorities , Bash@@ ar al @-@ Assad , backs up 51 percent of respon@@ dents , 20 percent would be . &quot;
29 percent could not decide .

&quot; after two days of press days , German Chancellor Angela Merkel will officially open the 6@@ 6th International Motor Show under the banner &quot; Mobility &quot; on Thursday . &quot;
the general public can visit the International Motor Show from Saturday .
&quot; the organizer of the Auto @-@ Verband V@@ DA expects about 900 000 visitors two years ago . &quot;
R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke : violence in the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border
the Hungarian police took over several hundred refugees at the Serbian border near R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke tear gas and water ej@@ ectors .
Euron@@ ews @-@ correspon@@ dent D@@ á@@ ni@@ el Bo@@ z@@ si@@ k has witnessed the outbreak of violence at the border control point .
he reported by telephone :
a group of refugees broke through the border .
behind it a police line had formed and behind the polic@@ emen stood a water @-@ thro@@ wer .
&quot; 40 to 50 refugees started throwing stones , sticks and plastic bottles to the officials . &quot;
the officials initially consisted of uns@@ killed pe@@ pper@@ spray .
&quot; after that , the police used tear gas . &quot;
a lot of tear gas was spra@@ yed towards the refugees .
thus the group was dissolved .
the refugees have now withdrawn .
a pregnant and apparently injured woman was removed from the zone .
&quot; children , who inhal@@ ed the tear gas , cried out . &quot;
other refugees collap@@ sed and suffered from short@@ ness of breath .
the police spokes@@ men of the Serbian police also suffered injuries by using tear gas and pepper spray .
time of decision on interest rates for the US bank@@ note
&quot; the world is watching if the US bank@@ note comes together on two days , on Wednesday and Thursday , in order to make the important decision whether for the first time since almost a decade the interest was raised or not . &quot;
&quot; a survey among 80 econom@@ ists questioned by Reu@@ ters found that a little more than half , the last week of the opinion was that the F@@ ed will do so , now thinks that the F@@ ed will remain a little longer and the interest rates at the current level will hold from 0 to 0.@@ 25 percent . &quot;
it is a historical event because it has been seven years since the F@@ ed interest rates on NU@@ LL .
&quot; for the first time , we approach a situation in which a large central bank may leave the zero area and start a process of normal@@ ising interest rates , &quot; &quot; said Angel U@@ bid , Managing Director at Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the U.S. economy is on a relatively good level of performance , tri@@ l@@ lion dollars are added to the balance sheet and generate only a low inflation . &quot;
&quot; however , the F@@ ed cannot ignore the less ros@@ y outlook on global circumstances . &quot;
&quot; it warned the markets to stop raising , but the signs indicate that the chances of such a step are good . &quot;
the decision will be announced at 8 : 00 CE@@ T on Thursday
&quot; sorry , there is no translation for this news @-@ article . &quot;
&quot; after shooting and killing his girlfriend in Miss@@ issi@@ ppi on Monday morning - and before he shot and killed his colleagues on the day , Sh@@ ann@@ on Lamb wrote a note to say that he was &quot; &quot; sorry &quot; &quot; in the first murder and wanted &quot; &quot; to make it happen &quot; , &quot; authorities announced on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the police in Gau@@ tier , Miss@@ issi@@ ppi , said that lamb , professor of ge@@ ography and social science education at the Delta State University , called the emergency number against 10 : 00 on Monday morning &quot;
&quot; and he said , He has shot on a man and killed a man . &quot;
lamb told the staff of the emergency centre that the police must send polic@@ emen to his home .
&quot; he said , &quot; &quot; I shot my wife yesterday evening &quot; &quot; and he also mentioned that a &quot; &quot; sweet dog &quot; &quot; is in the house , but &quot; &quot; no one will distur@@ b &quot; , &quot; but probably be excited . &quot;
&quot; the police in@@ quired the c@@ aller after his name , but he did not give him . &quot;
lamb gave no explanation for his shots .
&quot; when police saw the scene , they found the body of A@@ my Pr@@ enti@@ ss , 41 , and a hand@@ written note from Lamb , 45 , which said : &quot; I am sorry I wanted , I could reverse it . &quot;
I loved A@@ my and she is the only woman ever loved me .
&quot; after writing the note , Lamb imported 300 miles to the Delta State University , where he killed E@@ than Schmidt , a professor of history , before he finally took his own life on Monday evening when polic@@ emen en@@ cir@@ cl@@ ed him . &quot;
&quot; President William La@@ for@@ ge said he did not know anything about a conflict between Lamb and Schmidt , but &quot; of course there was something in Mr Lam@@ bs &apos;s performance . &quot;
&quot; despite reports on Monday , the Lamb allegedly believed that Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a relationship with Schmidt , authorities said on Tuesday that there is &quot; no information , no evidence &quot; for a &quot; tri@@ angular relationship . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss was written by Sha@@ wn O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en , who said they were married for about seven years , as a &quot; good man . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the two were divor@@ ced 15 years ago , but remained friends . &quot;
&quot; O &apos;@@ Ste@@ en said he and Pr@@ enti@@ ss had a daughter , who is 19 , and she is &quot; &quot; destroyed &quot; &quot; on the ground . &quot;
he said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss were her daughter &quot; absolutely best friends . &quot;
&quot; Pr@@ enti@@ ss worked online from home , according to L@@ ins@@ day Know@@ les , who was identified by Sun Her@@ ald as a close friend of Pr@@ enti@@ ss . &quot;
Know@@ les said that Pr@@ enti@@ ss who had a dog named Light@@ ning had met with Lamb for about three years .
&quot; she always wanted to help other people , &quot; said Know@@ les &quot;
&quot; the police said , Lamb had called relatives at a certain point on Monday to tell them , &quot; &quot; He is not going to jail . &quot;
&quot; when polic@@ emen picked him up on Highway 1 near Green@@ ville later this night , Lamb drove his car to the side , fled by foot , ran into the forest and killed himself with a shot . &quot;
lamb received a doctoral degree from the Delta State University in spring 2015 .
stars who have lost their lucky charm
&quot; the actor ( left ) , in the picture with his son Red@@ mond ( right ) , had some stress@@ ful years . &quot;
&quot; in 2001 , he fought against leu@@ k@@ emia , and in 2009 he lost his long@@ standing partner Far@@ rah F@@ aw@@ c@@ ett , for cancer . &quot;
&quot; the actor also allegedly fought with drugs , and in 2008 he was convic@@ ted of drug possession . &quot;
all this certainly demands his tribute .
Euro@@ wings : Lufthansa is expanding the Group
Lufthansa is planning a large corporate restructuring .
the Lufthansa Group wants to save half a billion euros a year alone with a better organization .
&quot; 150 of the approximately 1,000 executives around the world will cost the Group restructuring to the workplace . &quot;
&quot; with the pilot union , however , there are new negotiations . &quot;
the Lufthansa Cargo is expanding its corporate structure and upgrades the cheap Euro@@ wings .
&quot; the target of the re@@ orientation is a contribution to earnings of some EUR 500 million a year from cost and revenue syner@@ gies , the airline announced on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; among other things , Lufthansa is no longer a member of the Board of Directors for the passenger business in the future . &quot;
the Euro@@ wings budget line should be developed as independently as possible .
Karl Ulrich Gar@@ n@@ adt will be responsible for Euro@@ wings in the Executive Board around Chef Car@@ sten Sp@@ oh@@ r .
&quot; with the real@@ ignment , Sp@@ oh@@ r under@@ lines the importance of Euro@@ wings , with which the Group wants to compete against Ry@@ an@@ air and Easy@@ jet in the future . &quot;
&quot; up to now , the organization of the 120 000 employee has been complex . &quot;
&quot; the airlines have fir@@ med under the roof of the airline group , which represents three quarters of the annual turnover of 30 billion euros . &quot;
new negotiations with the pilots
&quot; in the collective wage conflict with the cockpit st@@ oning cockpit ( VC ) , the negotiations are to resume after the strike stopped on this Thursday . &quot;
this shared the union with them .
the theme of the talks is to be the retirement schemes for pilots .
&quot; in one year , the cockpit intends to reach sustainable results as quickly as possible . &quot;
the conflict between union and airline led to various strikes in recent months .
&quot; in addition to the transitional provision of the pilots , the &quot; Wings &quot; as@@ par@@ ag@@ us concept is behind . &quot;
&quot; in the fight against competitors , the Lufthansa Cargo has moved to the Euro@@ wings Group &apos;s own budget line . &quot;

Luke Sha@@ w of Manchester United can &apos;t play for months due to double frac@@ tures
&quot; in the Champions League defeat of Manchester at PS@@ V Ein@@ d@@ ho@@ ven , Luke Sha@@ w suffered a double frac@@ ture of his right leg . &quot;
&quot; while this brought the left external def@@ enders to cry and will exclude him for at least six months from playing , Louis van Ga@@ al doesn &apos;t give up the hope that Sha@@ w can play again this season . &quot;
the injury was caused by a ru@@ th@@ less attack by H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Mor@@ eno in the 15th minute after the 20 year old Sha@@ w was embedded in the PS@@ V range .
he was treated for nine minutes on the field and needed oxygen before being brought to hospital .
&quot; van Ga@@ al said : &quot; &quot; he has a double leg frac@@ ture and is located in the hospital . &quot;
he will be reloc@@ ated tomorrow or perhaps a day later and then operated in Manchester .
&quot; it &apos;s aw@@ ful - a boy who comes with 18 to Manchester United , it &apos;s very hard and then plays fantastic , and then it happens . &quot;
in the locker room he had an oxygen mask .
he cried .
&quot; I &apos;m not a doctor , but if you have a double frac@@ ture , then it takes six months , and it will not play in the group phase . &quot;
I hope he can play this season again .
Mor@@ eno seemed to be happy to escape a Red Card and the Sus@@ pension of an El@@ f@@ meter .
&quot; Nic@@ ola Ri@@ zz@@ oli , the arbitr@@ ator , has not punished the Mex@@ ic@@ ans . &quot;
van Ga@@ al assumed that the Italian arbitr@@ ator had mistaken .
you can judge for yourself if I say that an El@@ f@@ meter and a red card were due .
it was a very bad attack on both legs .
&quot; a T@@ we@@ et on Sha@@ ws account was saying , &quot; I thank you all for your news . words cannot describe how broken I am , my path to recovery begins now , I come back more strongly . &quot;
related to this : Manchester United suffers the loss of Luke Sha@@ w during the defeat at PS@@ V
&quot; with the European Championship in France , the UK distributor has an additional incentive to recover until next June . &quot;
&quot; Phil@@ lip Co@@ c@@ u , the PS@@ V @-@ Trainer , said : &quot; &quot; it is a very bad injury . &quot;
&quot; when a player leaves the place with this kind of injury , all are very sad about it . &quot;
it is never the intention of our players to hurt an opponent .
Mor@@ eno suffered a leg break when Mexico played against Van G@@ als Holland &apos;s team at the 2014 World Cup .
&quot; he is very hard because it &apos;s not his intention to hurt your opponent , and if you hear that it &apos;s a very bad injury , that &apos;s not good , &quot; &quot; said Co@@ c@@ u . &quot;
for me it was not possible to see the moment .
&quot; the only thing I could see was the ball rolling in a different direction , so it looked like he had touched him , but I couldn &apos;t see the attack on Luke . &quot;
&quot; in conversation with S@@ BS@@ 6 Mor@@ eno said : &quot; &quot; I know how it feels , I know how hard it can be . &quot;
I feel very bad about it . I &apos;m so sorry .
the PS@@ V player Andr@@ és Gu@@ ard@@ ado was also brought to the hospital - after a b@@ oul@@ der from Chris Sm@@ alling .
surely David Cameron knows The Lor@@ ax better ?
&quot; it is one thing that all parents will soon learn : if your child loves a book , it won &apos;t take long until you know it almost by heart . &quot;
unless you are David Cameron .
&quot; when he was asked by a provider of child@@ care systems to call his favourite chil@@ dr@@ ens book , the Prime Minister for The Lor@@ ax , the environmental fa@@ bel published in 1971 by Dr. Se@@ uss . &quot;
&quot; it was a difficult choice , writes Cameron in a message on the website of the company Super@@ camps , and continues : &quot; funny , moving , creative and with a powerful message , it &apos;s a book that I like to read to my children , because it always seems to give a picture or a message that we have missed so far . &quot;
&quot; all nicely and well , except that the following paragraph , in which Cameron supposedly describes the story of the book , returns an ingredient of the 2012 film version , adding new characters and details to extend the fairly short original text . &quot;
&quot; in the midst of the walled city of Th@@ ought @-@ Ville , where all nature has gone and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams , by fulfilling her desire to see a real tree , &quot; &quot; he reads . &quot;
&quot; as if that would not be suspi@@ cious enough : the text presented by Cameron is partly read as the summary of the Lor@@ ax film presented on the website of Internet Movie Database and thus begins : &quot; in the walled city Th@@ em @-@ Ville , where everything is artificial and even the air is a commodity , a boy called T@@ ed hopes to win the heart of Au@@ dre@@ y , the girl of his dreams . &quot;
&quot; although he ad@@ mits to be a pra@@ g@@ matic father , it seems unlikely that Cameron is so familiar with the story of the book . &quot;
most likely such a relatively low PR task has been deleg@@ ated to a hel@@ per who did not read The Lor@@ ax 20 times in a row .
a Down@@ ing Street spokes@@ woman said that the text probably came from Cameron &apos;s election circular office .
&quot; Super@@ Camp confirmed that the text was delivered by Cameron &apos;s staff , but there were no further direct comments . &quot;
Adam Ly@@ th was clearly threatened by the expul@@ sion from England &apos;s team but it is still difficult
&quot; hitting Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates is a difficult task , but if one sees the cad@@ res selected to the UK for the tour , a repetition of the 3 @-@ 0 test series defeat is not on my map . &quot;
I would not exclude a down@@ right victory .
&quot; A@@ last@@ air C@@ ooks page may be less experienced than the three years ago , but there are good spin players in the bat@@ ting list , and the community spirit is strong ; they won &apos;t wear sc@@ ars of 2012 , only a you@@ thful positive attitude . &quot;
&quot; with the ball , Mo@@ een Ali develops as a spin @-@ punch and Adi@@ l Ras@@ hid , even if it represents an unknown size at the test level , is an option for the attack . &quot;
news @-@ related news : Adam Ly@@ ths emerges from the England @-@ Test @-@ Ka@@ der and is replaced by Alex H@@ ales .
&quot; the decision to leave Adam Ly@@ th is , of course , hard to analyse for me as his head coach in Yor@@ k@@ shire . &quot;
&quot; during his seven tests , there were two good attacks under difficult conditions , and the simple but hard reality is that cri@@ cket players are focused on results . &quot;
&quot; there was no question mark with Joe R@@ oot , for example , and that led to the nom@@ ination , da - and I said this before - players are their own best selection . &quot;
&quot; long ago , one would have extended the course of Ly@@ th , but he had control of his own fate . &quot;
&quot; if he hopefully kno@@ cks out further runs for Yor@@ k@@ shire , there will be another chance . &quot;
&quot; the England @-@ Trainer Tre@@ vor Ba@@ yl@@ iss praised his attitude , even if he did not get such good performances , and that doesn &apos;t surprise me ; he is above all a team man . &quot;
the question of how much time a test drummer gets to set his character is difficult .
&quot; Ly@@ th got seven chances , like Sam Rob@@ son before him , while Nick Comp@@ ton got nine . &quot;
only Comp@@ ton got the chance to play home and out .
&quot; the only accus@@ ation you can rise was that England first used Jonathan Trot@@ t in the Caribbean - as Ly@@ th was in top form , but this lost opportunity is now in the past . &quot;
&quot; Alex H@@ ales comes in , and he &apos;s a drummer , whom I set up high . &quot;
&quot; he is an X @-@ factor cri@@ cket player , what we saw at Yor@@ k@@ shire early in this season when he scored 2@@ 36 in front of us on a Tr@@ ent Bridge , which met us very much . &quot;
&quot; he must have at least the same odds as those before him , but this depends naturally on the position of cre@@ w@@ men in the United Arab Emirates . &quot;
&quot; the idea to let Mo@@ ose beat next to Cook , which would provide an extra spin @-@ bowl and get four squ@@ e@@ aks appeared , and I have nothing against it . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t see why a drummer can &apos;t beat there , and this left @-@ h@@ anders has already shown that he is a devil &apos;s sco@@ oter of cri@@ cket players . &quot;
&quot; Mo@@ een perhaps did not do his job for his County Wor@@ c@@ ester@@ shire , but he is number 3 for them , and there is no big difference . &quot;
&quot; my former team @-@ mate J@@ ustin Lan@@ ger played his first 38 tests at the first drop , before he res@@ igned as op@@ ener in 2001 . &quot;
&quot; he made three hundred of us straight away , and did not look back . &quot;
&quot; Z@@ afar Ans@@ ari is in the cad@@ res as a back @-@ up sp@@ inner , and in my limited contact with him he was very impressed by me as a young man . &quot;
&quot; people may see his statistics - average 31 with the bat and 35 with the ball - and think it &apos;s a punch , but there is no large number of backup spi@@ ders who raise their hands and the trainers have decided for youth . &quot;
he will learn a lot on this tour .
&quot; apart from the team , England has taken a few wise additions to the trainer . &quot;
&quot; the appointment of Mah@@ ela J@@ ay@@ awar@@ dene , the B@@ ats@@ man from Sri Lanka , as a consultant for the test games could be a master coup . &quot;
&quot; he is one of the nic@@ est guys in the game , who will bring a wealth of experiences as he played under all conditions and against all the attacks . &quot;
Paul Coll@@ ing@@ wood comes for the white ball phase of the tour and brings energy and a powerful application to the setup .
&quot; I always felt that he was created for the international cri@@ cket competition , as a player or as a coach , and like Mah@@ ela he has insights from which we can benefit . &quot;
&quot; sometimes new voices can bring fresh breeze in the locker room , even if the messages are in accordance with the foreg@@ o@@ ing . &quot;
&quot; Coll@@ i &apos;s te@@ amm@@ ate at Dur@@ ham , Ben St@@ okes , is not used by the One @-@ Da@@ yers , R@@ oot received a similar break against Australia and I have no problem with it for my part . &quot;
&quot; while some will not agree , but coaches and team players do not determine the schedule . &quot;
and you must remember that as with the players their jobs depend on the results .
such decisions are not made of light heart .
the Bre@@ x@@ it camp ( Bre@@ x@@ it = exit of Great Britain from the EU ) could gain access if the economy is in a f@@ lar@@ ing unit by 2017

&quot; Prime Minister and Finance Minister climb on summit meetings or bilateral meetings in foreign capitals , make a photo of themselves in front of a famous local monument , with or without local sizes , then come home and say that they win allies for reforms . &quot;
it &apos;s always around me .
&quot; my European boy@@ friend who wants to look outside Great Britain inside the EU tent - &quot; Let &apos;s not alone with France , &quot; says Berlin - and let us see that more and more short @-@ si@@ ghted ministers and officials have come to the point where it doesn &apos;t matter whether we stay or go . &quot;
&quot; German cau@@ tious chan@@ cell@@ or Angela Merkel is an ally , but she has been in power for 10 years and wants to leave the office before it looks bad for her , as in the exagger@@ ations it has happened ( 11 years ) , Mit@@ terr@@ and ( 14 ) and K@@ ohl ( 16 ) . &quot;
French François Hollande is looking back on his re @-@ election or his replacement in 2017 .
he is also a verbal power .
&quot; Poland may soon have a nation@@ alist right @-@ wing government , Spain is a lef@@ tist . &quot;
&quot; it is hard to imagine that they will tear themselves up a leg to help the Sel@@ f@@ ie @-@ British , whose energy is better used to prevent Scotland &apos;s exit from the UK - something they do not want , because most similar separ@@ ati@@ st tendencies have . &quot;
&quot; therefore , some such ministers might even deliberately not plan helpful comments , entirely in the SN@@ P style , while Britain &apos;s refer@@ encing campaign in 2017 to speed up the Bre@@ x@@ it process susp@@ ects my boy@@ friend . &quot;
&quot; the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation was a bankrupt@@ cy &quot; &quot; and &quot; &quot; Great Britain has won nothing from the ren@@ eg@@ oti@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; the Europeans know how rob@@ ber@@ y the Fle@@ et Street can be at its cost , and which EU scep@@ tics is the oli@@ gar@@ chy of the Pres@@ seb@@ ar@@ one , as they did not support our entry in 1973 with a ratio of 2 : 1 . &quot;
&quot; you can remember Boris Johnson , the ore @-@ euro opportunity opport@@ uni@@ sts who have made a name as an &quot; EU @-@ Ger@@ ber ban@@ anas &quot; Brussels correspon@@ dent in the early 90 &apos;s . &quot;
&quot; in all his ma@@ dness , Ed Mili@@ band knew who his enemies were . &quot;
&quot; this includes the Med@@ ley of tax @-@ fear@@ ing villa@@ ins , telephone @-@ h@@ ack@@ ening ali@@ ens and the pseudo non @-@ countries who own most of our big newspapers . &quot;
&quot; actually Tony Bla@@ ir thought similarly about it , but noted that if you sit with a hot gor@@ illa in a cage , you better distribute ban@@ anas to distra@@ ct him , instead of going to his lunch and dinner . &quot;
&quot; in fact , Mili@@ band was more bla@@ zer than Bla@@ ir himself when he opposed Cameron &apos;s referendum , because Bla@@ ir had set the principle of the non @-@ adopted constitution of the EU which was then rejected by French and Dutch voters in 2005 , which opened a backdoor . &quot;
the press has never let him go .
&quot; but the nice Jerem@@ y Cor@@ by@@ n , who gave me a friendly flap on the back on Monday - I told him that he didn &apos;t need time for me - seems in danger to repeat N@@ eil Kin@@ no@@ ck &apos;s boy@@ cot@@ t Mur@@ doch &apos;s strategy of the 80 &apos;s , a mistake then and today . &quot;
&quot; it may take , but he must develop a coherent strategy to win the media , not with me , but certainly with Andrew Mar@@ r , whose BBC @-@ sofa he left on Sunday . &quot;
Cor@@ by@@ ns &apos;s official position in Europe - I express it friendly - in development .
he says that we should stay in a re@@ formed EU .
&quot; well , most people outside of U@@ ki@@ p &apos;s traditional blue @-@ blo@@ t @-@ tendency and the wild det@@ ain@@ ees of Tor@@ ey Klein @-@ Engl@@ ish@@ ismus he can say Yes . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s what Hil@@ ary said &quot; A Ben@@ n , but no B@@ enn@@ ite &quot; Ben@@ n on the radio and television this week , when the boy sc@@ outs in him fought , not admit that Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s appointment of the provo@@ king John Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell was a bad idea . &quot;
&quot; it reminded me of the 70 @-@ year @-@ old , when his old father tried to be il@@ legitimate to his Labour Cab@@ inet mates , without going too far and losing his cabinet job . &quot;
Hil@@ ar@@ ys &apos;s struggle was even more attractive .
&quot; but to fight to remain &quot; under all circumstances &quot; - B@@ enn@@ s expression - was not what Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said , nor what J@@ C told his comrades and de@@ pu@@ ties after all reports on their cl@@ auses on Monday evening . &quot;
&quot; whatever the touching bottom @-@ up image of Cor@@ by@@ n wants to convey , remember that he even touched me - news discipline remains important in the age of TV around the clock and above all in the whirlpool of social media , a breeding place of par@@ ano@@ ia and betra@@ yal . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s right to give Cameron no free ticket for Europe , which allows him to hold Lab@@ ours support in the refer@@ ential campaign for a matter of course like Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell said . &quot;
Simon J@@ enk@@ ins certainly thinks so .
&quot; but Mc@@ Don@@ n@@ ell and Cor@@ by@@ n &apos;s basic ambig@@ u@@ ities on EU membership - in line with their B@@ enn@@ ite siege economy , their anti @-@ capitalist past - is no longer just a matter of es@@ ot@@ eric debate among the left dissi@@ dents , for which the nar@@ c@@ iss@@ ism of the small difference is a central principle of dog@@ matic disputes . &quot;
&quot; as with his ambig@@ u@@ ities on Nato - Tom Wat@@ son is convinced that J@@ C does not start a campaign to exit - foreign diplom@@ ats will be obliged to try , in all sense , to find a sense for their superi@@ ors at home . &quot;
&quot; why should Paris or Berlin waste political capital - they also have di@@ stru@@ st@@ ful voters - in order to make concessions to the British , if all this can be sen@@ sel@@ ess ? &quot;
&quot; the US has already been quite disappointed by the weak military power in Iraq , Libya and Syria , even with a lowering of the T@@ ory government in power , which I was reminded on Monday by something British In@@ flu@@ ence Security Forum . &quot;
experts critic@@ ise report from Public Health England via e @-@ cigar@@ ettes
&quot; claims of a state @-@ funded agency that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are less harmful than smoking originated from a meeting of 12 people , partly with links to tobacco industry , said researchers . &quot;
&quot; experts who write in the British Medical Journal ( BM@@ J ) , Lanc@@ et concluded by critic@@ ising the evidence that was used by Public Health England ( P@@ he ) in their report on e @-@ cigar@@ ettes . &quot;
he published the &quot; basic report &quot; last month and describes it as a &quot; comprehensive review of the evidence . &quot;
&quot; however , some researchers questioned the resili@@ ence of the data and pointed to the links between some experts and the tobacco industry . &quot;
&quot; an editorial in the medical journal Lanc@@ et last month , attacked the &quot; extremely wind@@ y foundation &quot; on which he founded his most important conclusion . &quot;
two other researchers write in BM@@ J and asked if the claims are based on stone or sand .
&quot; Martin Mc@@ K@@ ee , Professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Trop@@ ical Medicine and Simon Cap@@ e@@ well , Professor of Clinical Epide@@ mi@@ ology at the University of Liverpool , said : &quot; a fundamental principle of public health is that strategies should be based on the evidence of efficacy . &quot;
they said that the public expects that the statement of P@@ he that &quot; The current best estimate is that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are about 95 % less harmful than smoking &quot; on a detailed review of evidence and modelling .
&quot; in fact , this statement comes from a single meeting of 12 people who were called to develop a model for multiple criteria decision analysis ( Multi @-@ C@@ riteri@@ a Dec@@ ision Analysis - MC@@ DA ) to conduct their opinions on the damage of various ni@@ cot@@ ine containing products to a synthesis ; the results of the meeting were summ@@ ar@@ ised in a research report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that a sponsor of the meeting was a company called Euro@@ Swiss Health , whose managing director had previously received British American Tob@@ acco remedies ( BA@@ T ) for an independent study . &quot;
&quot; he also wrote references from BA@@ T to Public Health in a Sustainability Report , they said . &quot;
&quot; one of the 12 participants at the meeting declared funds to be received by an e @-@ cigarette manufacturer , but not the funding he was supposed to have received according to reports from the tobacco company Philip Mor@@ ris International added them . &quot;
&quot; the reasons for selecting the members of the body are not delivered , but this includes several well @-@ known e @-@ cigar@@ ettes champi@@ ons , some of which also include a sector financing in the paper . &quot;
some other participants at this meeting are not known for their know @-@ how in tobacco control .
at the meeting also attended the tobacco management of P@@ he .
&quot; the research work of the group &quot; &quot; stands clearly &quot; &quot; that there is a lack of &quot; &quot; hard evidence for the damage of most products in most criteria , &quot; &quot; wrote Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well . &quot;
&quot; however , none of these compounds or restrictions are discussed in the P@@ he report . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ K@@ ee and Cap@@ e@@ well said that &quot; &quot; there &apos;s no evidence so far that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes served as a way to smoke for children or non @-@ smokers &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Pro@@ f Kevin F@@ ent@@ on , Director of Health and Well @-@ being at P@@ he , said that BM@@ J &apos;s claims have already been re@@ acted before . &quot;
he said : &quot; e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are much less harmful than smoking .
every second lifel@@ ong smo@@ ker dies at his addiction .
&quot; all evidence suggests that the health risks of e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are low compared to that , but that we continue to study long @-@ term effects . &quot;
&quot; he has the clear duty to inform the public about what the evidence proves and what not , especially if there is so much public confusion over the relative dangers in comparison to tobacco . &quot;
&quot; nearly 80@@ ,000 people die every year on a disease with respect to smoking , and smoking costs the National Health System two billion pounds per year . &quot;
&quot; the clear provision of current evidence that e @-@ cigar@@ ettes are not without risk , but only a fraction of the harm caused by smoking , we comply with our national jurisdiction . &quot;
&quot; BBC should give up East@@ En@@ ders , says former Chef of Channel 4 &quot;
&quot; the former chairman of Channel 4 , Luke Johnson , said that the BBC should stop sending programs such as East@@ En@@ ders and The Voice . he said that commercial ri@@ vals would &quot; give her right arm &quot; for hit shows like the Albert Square So@@ ap . &quot;
Johnson said that the radio fee should only be used to make the type of programs that are not sent by other UK transm@@ it@@ ters .
&quot; he critici@@ zed the BBC for making public @-@ law programs , which are likely to be seen by a smaller audience , to place in hard @-@ controversial time windows against the most popular shows of their ri@@ vals and of sen@@ ders like BB@@ C@@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; after the BBC General Director , Tony Hall , said the company wanted to do more in partnership with other organizations , Johnson said he had tried for six years in his time with Channel 4 without success to get in touch with the BBC . &quot;
&quot; I have problems with the idea that BBC programmes are commissioned or sent , which would also clearly be shown by non @-@ subsi@@ dis@@ ed ri@@ vals , &quot; said Johnson to the Upper House Communications Committee as part of his investigation on the future of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; if you want to keep the radio charge what I don &apos;t think about a good idea in the medium or long term , you should at least put your production on programs that others do not do or commission . &quot;
they send The Voice in a first @-@ class time window because they want to achieve as broad a support for their future .
&quot; the idea that otherwise no one would show this is a joke , it &apos;s ridi@@ culous , it &apos;s natural non@@ sense . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t see why a reg@@ res@@ sive tax scheme could be financed , which could also be financed without subsidies . &quot;
&quot; the Voice is such a program , East@@ En@@ ders is another , ad@@ mitt@@ edly both own productions . &quot;
&quot; to be honest , other channels would give their right arm to it . &quot;
I &apos;m sorry to see how this is supposed to be public television .
I don &apos;t think that this would reduce the BBC at all .
&quot; Johnson , an entrepreneur for series that led Channel 4 from 2004 to 2010 , said that the BBC was to blame for the pursuit of valu@@ ations &quot; because of the ambi@@ tions of the people who work there , and because they believe this is the best way to secure long @-@ term support . &quot;
&quot; his comments on BBC &apos;s most popular broad@@ casts include what the former head of Sky , Tony Ball , suggested in his Mac@@ tag@@ gart presentation in Edinburgh in 2003 that the BBC shows like East@@ En@@ ders should sell . &quot;
&quot; Johnson said that the rather public @-@ legal ni@@ ches @-@ programs should go to BB@@ C@@ 4 , where you can &apos;t measure the audience , but they fulfill their tasks and they can argue , if they go to their apparent missions for justification of £ 4 billion , &quot; Well , of course , we have created all these obsc@@ ure programs that no one has seen . &quot;
they put them in a time window in which no one ever wanted to see them .
Johnson said to the committee : &quot; I urge you to find a rather reg@@ res@@ sive system in terms of conditions who can get the best value here .
&quot; of course you all think , we all think that you get a great value for £ 150 a year , but for people who is a lot of money for the £ 150 , ask me if that &apos;s true because they do not consume much of the BBC . &quot;
&quot; former Sky@@ - and Channel 5 chief David El@@ stein , who also testified before the committee on Tuesday , called for the BBC to check its ethics mission , &quot; &quot; to educ@@ ate , educ@@ ate and enter@@ tain . &quot;
&quot; he said that only little of the BBC production would now be officially classified as education - he said it would be 1 % of their TV production and 0.1 % on the radio - and they should take an example in &quot; &quot; inform , enligh@@ ten and enter@@ tain &quot; &quot; to the public broad@@ casts in Australia and Canada . &quot;
&quot; on the issue of partnerships , El@@ stein said that the BBC should do more in areas like that of the pro@@ ms , of which he said that only a handful are shown on TV , and with the commercial broad@@ caster alliances to make everything available online . &quot;
&apos;@@ Son@@ o@@ genetics &apos; can control brain cells through sound waves
the video shows how the nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses .
scientists have bred worms with genetically modified nervous systems that can be controlled by out@@ breaks of sound waves .
the tiny nem@@ ato@@ des change the direction in the moment they are be@@ amed with sound impulses which have too high frequencies for human hearing to be heard .
&quot; the impulses work by switching on mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on cells , which are genetically modified to carry the membrane channels that react to ultrasound waves . &quot;
further information on this topic : researchers read and write brain activity with light
&quot; the researchers said the worms showed the power of a new method called Son@@ o@@ Genetics , in which ultrasound can be used to activate a number of brain , heart and muscle cells outside the body . &quot;
&quot; Sre@@ ek@@ an@@ th Chal@@ as@@ ani , researcher at the Sal@@ k Institute in La J@@ oll@@ a , California , told the Guardian that the procedure of one day could replace the deep brain stimulation , a invasive procedure that gives electrical impulses to the brain of people for treating the symptoms of Parkinson &apos;s disease . &quot;
&quot; thread worms generally do not react to ultrasound , but Chal@@ as@@ ani realized they were doing it when they were surrounded by a liquid with micro@@ scopic bubbles . &quot;
&quot; the bubbles , he found out , ampli@@ fy the ultrasound waves , which then penetrate into the worms . &quot;
&quot; the ampli@@ fied ultrasound waves act on structures , which are called TR@@ P @-@ 4 @-@ ion channels and are found in the membranes of some of the worms cells . &quot;
&quot; the sound waves cause the opening of these ion channels and activate the cells they are assigned to , such as a report Nature Communications . &quot;
&quot; in order to create ultrasound @-@ controlled nem@@ ato@@ des , Chal@@ as@@ ani genetically modified the worms in such a way that some of their Mot@@ on@@ eur@@ one TR@@ P @-@ 4 ion channels carry . &quot;
&quot; if it applies ultrasound to the modified creatures , the sound waves are ampli@@ fied by the micro@@ bubbles and transferred to the worms , where they turn on the changed mot@@ on@@ eur@@ on@@ ons . &quot;
&quot; the procedure has some similarities with Op@@ to@@ genetics , a ground @-@ breaking tool that enables scientists to switch on and off neur@@ ons with impulses of light . &quot;
but Chal@@ as@@ ani said that Son@@ o@@ genetics could have some advantages over this technique .
&quot; in contrast to light , which must be sent down to the desired position in the brain , low frequency ultrasound waves can pass un@@ hin@@ dered and can thus be sent to the brain from above on the skull . &quot;
&quot; we believe that with gene therapy and a therapeutic virus it is possible to make the targeted human neur@@ ons temporarily suscep@@ tible to the ultrasound signal in a clinical setting for certain neuro@@ logical treatments , &quot; said Chal@@ as@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; other applications could focus on muscle cells and insulin @-@ producing cells , he added . &quot;

&quot; V@@ C@@ CP creative director Matt L@@ ever was amazed at the silence , which reigned around the advertising for the arms trade fair - through a space of the Ce@@ L calendar - and thought : &quot; &quot; let &apos;s give them the campaign they try to avoid . &quot;
&quot; they played with the invention of a more realistic z@@ wi@@ el@@ ich company advertising , but &quot; through the blu@@ ish with bright colours and animation it remains stronger . &quot;
&quot; they did a fantastic job by helping us raise awareness of the sale of illegal torture appliances at the fair , &quot; says Tom Davi@@ es of Am@@ nesty . &quot;
what we need now is the intervention of the British government and the guarantee that torture equipment cannot be tra@@ ded illeg@@ ally in front of our door@@ step .

eight golden rules for living in student residence halls
&quot; eleven years ago , as a self @-@ forgotten 19 @-@ year @-@ old , I moved into a student residence , still in faith in ber@@ ets and moral rel@@ ati@@ vis@@ m , but only now I remember the ten@@ se sm@@ iles of those I have anno@@ yed - and to the numerous , lengthy complaints about others . &quot;
most of what I have learned can be disti@@ lled in eight simple rules .
the entrance to the residence halls ranges from slightly nerve wre@@ cking to absolutely frigh@@ tening .
&quot; it is temp@@ ting to s@@ wat@@ ery : people tell where you come from , whether and where you have taken Sab@@ bat@@ ax , where you stand in relation to Cor@@ by@@ n and why you honestly do not love or hate , because in Ernst , guys , it &apos;s just a yeast extract ha@@ ha@@ ha , I am in my room . &quot;
breathe through .
and help others to do the same - ask questions and show interest .
&quot; it distra@@ cts the conversation and helps you to find out the people you like in contrast to those with which you would not speak , even if your eyel@@ ashes were burned and these fire extingu@@ ishers would be . &quot;
let people .
&quot; people often turn into drinks @-@ recep@@ tions , film @-@ night venues and municipal hits , but they are also the places where people dress and take their under@@ wear . &quot;
related to this : don &apos;t remember to start with a relationship at the university
intro@@ ver@@ ted receive a rough treatment at the university .
&quot; your room should be a refuge , but many student resi@@ dences form a space @-@ to @-@ room bo@@ omer@@ ang culture that is friendly and social and can lead to life @-@ long friendship . &quot;
this can be hell for someone trying to recover .
&quot; nothing in culture allows you to say : &quot; I like you , and I want our friendship to go on , but you have to go away so that I get back the energy that I have consumed for interaction with you . &quot;
&quot; try to feel when a fellow soldier is exhausted by con@@ vivi@@ ality , and send it a text message instead of kno@@ cking . &quot;
apro@@ pos you kno@@ ck : do it .
a guy in my student residence had the idea that an un@@ locked door was an invitation .
he saw some things .
close friendship through baking .
&quot; as you start the university at the high point of the back man@@ ia , the kno@@ cking on the doors of people to present yourself with a plate of brow@@ ni@@ es is less strange than the welcome of the 1950 &apos;s &quot; welcome in the neighborhood , I made you a little bit baked . so , and now please smile if I ask you some personal questions . &quot;
offering homemade treats is a good way to close friend@@ ships .
your room@@ mates feel obliged to enter@@ tain themselves and will eventually associate your face with a delicious surprise .
of course this depends on whether you are a decent b@@ aker .
&quot; mis@@ used cl@@ um@@ ps of flour , sugar and fat lead to people sleeping when you kno@@ ck . &quot;
ste@@ aling food is a common crime in student residence .
&quot; of course , the ho@@ of of chicken is a theft , but is it taking a drop of milk for your tea too ? &quot;
check this with the milk owner .
&quot; chances are good that they say to use themselves , even if they cook inside . &quot;
&quot; if someone ste@@ als your stuff , it &apos;s annoying , and you have my compassion - but try to deal with more balanced ones than my room@@ mate , who added to their milk a dish@@ washing agent to punish thi@@ eves . &quot;
she is now in jail .
they should not make any noise that keeps people from sleep or work .
&quot; it &apos;s not just about being a decent person , but that you belong to the people who sit in the glass house in the tru@@ est sense of the saying . &quot;
&quot; a girl in my corridor asked her neighbors whether it makes up a bit qui@@ eter for them , because it was three o &apos;clock in the morning , and she had a test in the morning . &quot;
they responded with even more loud music .
&quot; when she finally stopped at 5 o &apos;clock , she kindly allowed her neighbors to sleep two hours before she left her own music , shut her door and went to her three @-@ hour examination . &quot;
wouldn &apos;t it be romantic if your future spouse acci@@ dentally moved to the same residence hall ?
&quot; conver@@ sely , it wouldn &apos;t be too embarrass@@ ing if you &apos;re a room@@ mate for your future spouse , get rid of them , dis@@ connect and see them each day , and perhaps see how they all come across to their friends ? &quot;
&quot; of course , the heart goes its own way - but if a hot room@@ mate is definitely not your future spouse , try at least to talk to your lower abdom@@ en a little reason . &quot;
&quot; in the exciting moment in which you notice that someone has left his keys in his not locked room , the boundary between a Ul@@ k and bul@@ lying is fin@@ er than it seems . &quot;
&quot; a good stun@@ t is funny , but it only takes moments until it becomes a bo@@ omer@@ ang . &quot;
by hiding a valuable and am@@ using lesson on security - but never ch@@ ew someone &apos;s room with tooth@@ paste and sham@@ poo .
close your door and place your keys in a glass of water which you then put in the freezer - but do not stap@@ le your possessions on the ceiling no more than twice .

thousands of refugees will push for the housing market .
the entrepreneur Markus Gil@@ dner believes to know how quickly affordable living space can be created : he builds terra@@ ced houses for refugees in a project .
&quot; Mr. Gil@@ dner , many refugees will push for the housing market . &quot;
which solution do you offer ?
Markus Gil@@ dner : the mass accommodation in containers or gy@@ ms has no sustainability .
for the people remain to a great extent here .
&quot; in view of the flow of refugees , we also need sufficient living space in the coming decades . &quot;
&quot; a very ban@@ al , three @-@ storey terra@@ ced house is the solution . &quot;
Gil@@ dner : a town@@ house needs a minimum of space .
it facilitates integration .
this is different if you are bringing people into blocks of flats .
&quot; each of the six houses , which are currently being built in the pilot project , consists of three housing units for four asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; each unit has two bedrooms , a bathroom , a kitchen and a common room . &quot;
&quot; it may be that many refugees will say it is peace again , I go back . &quot;
then the houses can be easily rebuilt according to their needs .
what is the cost ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : the price for 160 square meters of living space per house is 18@@ 4 000 Euro , without plot . &quot;
this is man@@ a@@ geable .
construction lasted six months .
that is appropriate .
have the building regulations complicated their plans ?
Gil@@ dner : building legally I &apos;ve gone through my project correctly .
&quot; especially complicated , it always makes the im@@ pending dam@@ om clause special construction and the Stand@@ ing Ord@@ in@@ ance . &quot;
gr@@ us@@ el@@ ig .
&quot; it is still under@@ lined , who creates three apartments in a terra@@ ced house needs at least three pitches . &quot;
only in the cities there is no place .
and refugees and asylum seekers have no cars .
how did residents react to their terra@@ ced house project ?
Gil@@ dner : there were those who accused me of creating luxury buildings for asylum seekers .
which is definitely not right .
but do you not tigh@@ ten the competition for affordable housing ?
&quot; Gil@@ dner : true , we had a construction boom in Germany over the last five years , but we built luxury apartments that hardly could afford more . &quot;
&quot; my project has the message , even the ordinary people need living space . &quot;
&quot; not only refugees , but also the single @-@ educ@@ ating mother or the tann@@ ing servant . &quot;
I &apos;ll show you how to build a cheap and good one today .
that is why it is all about .

&quot; some have encountered problems after installation , as they receive an error message telling that the &quot; &quot; software update failed &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; to avoid the problem , users are recommended to either wait until the rush goes back or attempt to update via iTunes . &quot;
the phone itself guides you through the rest of the process .

&quot; it is worth to make sure your mobile phone is charged during the update , or is located near a charger , so that the battery is charged . &quot;
&quot; if the load is too low , Apple does not allow the update to continue because the phone might switch to half way and this could result in a crash of the update . &quot;

Ros@@ berg &apos;s only motto : full attacks
N@@ ico Ros@@ berg knows only one motto in the fight for the World Cup title in Formula 1 against his clearly leading Mercedes team@@ mates Lewis Hamilton : &quot; full Att@@ acks . &quot;
&quot; the World Cup ended before the start to the crucial seven overseas races , &quot; &quot; that I had nothing to lose . &quot;
53 points separate the vice @-@ champion ahead of the race in Singapore this Sunday from defending champion and two @-@ way champion Hamilton .
&quot; the Br@@ ite already won seven of the twelve season races so far , taking the Grand Prix in the city @-@ state as a favorite in the city @-@ state . &quot;
&quot; in 2009 and last year , the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Brit@@ on could win the race . &quot;
whether the current smo@@ g in the city state will have influence on the Grand Prix of Singapore is still unclear .
&quot; for days , a ha@@ ze @-@ bell hangs over the city , triggered by fires on the neighbouring island Sum@@ atra . &quot;
bad Kis@@ singer Schach@@ club has a prominent member
&quot; the Schach@@ club Bad Kis@@ singen , which was founded three months ago , has joined another member in its ranks , thus increasing the number of members to 19 players . &quot;
&quot; the new member is the entrepreneur Paul G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann , a passionate chess and tennis player , who spent more than 40 times in Bad Kis@@ singen to the cure . &quot;

G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann supported the chess club in Bad Kis@@ singen with a donation which was accepted by the chairman Alfred Klein .
&quot; this makes it possible to record chess players , who cannot raise the membership fee . &quot;
youth work and talent search are also to be promoted .
G@@ aus@@ el@@ mann wishes that membership in the chess club and also friendly contact to the tennis club &quot; Rot @-@ Weiß &quot; as an expression of his connection with the spa town is seen .
Qu@@ arti@@ san@@ .com seeks direct contact
Sal@@ u@@ dis and the Anton@@ isti@@ ft district centre have joined forces under the umbrella of the Social Fund and opened a new focal point at the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg Square .
&quot; besides consulting , one can also participate in courses . &quot;
the Sozial@@ stiftung puts it down from the mountain to the inner city .
more specifically to the Graf @-@ St@@ auff@@ enberg @-@ Platz .
there was recently opened a new district office .
&quot; here , right next to the shopping market , sen@@ iors and counsel@@ ors will receive information on questions such as nursing insurance or services of health and nursing homes . &quot;
&quot; for years , we have established with our out@@ patient nursing staff that often care@@ gi@@ vers are left alone . &quot;
there are infin@@ itely many questions .
&quot; many services of the insurance companies are not rarely used because the complexity of the insurance is hardly understood , &quot; explained the new owner Jutta Wei@@ g@@ and , who is also responsible for the Anton@@ isti@@ ft and the Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Hospital as head of the elderly and for the out@@ patient service &quot; Ama@@ de@@ us . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in addition to the consultations , the new district office also offers prevention , health care courses and wellness . &quot;
&quot; for this purpose , the Sal@@ u@@ dis was taken into the boat . &quot;
&quot; therefore , additional offers such as crash prevention , memory training or physi@@ otherapy can be used . &quot;
the offers of the senior centre and the Sal@@ u@@ dis complement each other in an ideal way .
&quot; Sal@@ u@@ dis stands for prevention , prevention and rehabilitation . &quot;
&quot; the senior centre for care and care , &quot; said Hei@@ ke R@@ ie@@ del , Managing Director of Sal@@ u@@ dis . &quot;
the reason for the opening of the new district office in the city centre is the demographic change .
because it is a good decentr@@ alised infrastructure in the individual districts of Bam@@ berg in the future indispensable .
&quot; in addition , the mayor Wolfgang Metz@@ ner ( SPD ) under@@ lined with the inauguration celebrations , the district office also dedic@@ ates itself to the association agreement at the age : &quot; there are numerous events and offers on the program and these invite to a regular soci@@ able co @-@ ordination . &quot;
this makes the social foundation a big contribution that sen@@ iors can live independently and well in their familiar surroundings .
&quot; the Qu@@ arti@@ s Office is open Monday , Wednesday and Friday from 9 a.m. to 2 p.m. , Tu@@ es@@ days and Thurs@@ days from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. and Satur@@ days from 10 a.m. to 12 p.m. &quot;

&quot; according to his own statement , 30 kilograms of muscle mass have been added over the past two years . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , he did not have an intellectual attitude . &quot;

&quot; as a result , the police ra@@ ged out of the shop , insul@@ ted the officials , and accused her of a fine fine of money from his feet , as reported in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper . &quot;
&quot; in the city of Bremen , one confirms the accus@@ ations , but it is not yet clear about the consequences for the unusual incident . &quot;
&quot; the thing is still in the test , &quot; says the city of Bremen . &quot;
&quot; after that , I will decide whether the meadow will be shown or not . &quot;

men beat in 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afgh@@ ans
&quot; witnesses are looking for a case in Bad So@@ den @-@ Sal@@ mün@@ ster : on Friday evening , at 23.@@ 45 p.m. , three young men were on foot from Bad So@@ den towards Sal@@ mün@@ ster . &quot;
&quot; according to the police , one from the group , a 17 @-@ year @-@ old Afghan , followed his two friends at a distance of about five meters and called them to wait for him . &quot;
at this point the group was at the height of the b@@ ft gas station .
there were also three persons on the premises of the gas station .
&quot; one of these men therefore cried out to the young man , and struck him with the fist . &quot;
the victim suffered a no@@ stri@@ al break and ble@@ ed strongly from the nose .
&quot; when his two friends ha@@ sten@@ ed and appe@@ aled to the bat , he first left his victim . &quot;
the injured young man was brought home by his friends .
the offen@@ ders followed the group with a car up to their home and drove there demonstr@@ atively several times .
&quot; when you no longer saw the vehicle , the injured went to the building to smoke a cigarette . &quot;
there he was attacked again by the bat and another male person .
&quot; with the aid of a strike @-@ stal@@ k , one examined the face and the thi@@ ghs of the victim . &quot;
the injured person had to be hospit@@ alized for medical care .
&quot; up to now , only a vag@@ ue work description is available . &quot;
one of the men was about 1.@@ 80 meters in size .
the second ra@@ cket was supposed to have been about 1.@@ 65 m tall and was dressed with a jeans and a brown @-@ white shirt .
the police asks witnesses and evidence to report under the phone number 06@@ 18@@ 1 / 100 @-@ 123 .
Dr. Frank Müller takes over practical field breaks and inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros
Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l and Frank Müller ( from left ) assume the practice of Karl @-@ Heinrich and Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen .
&quot; the mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann , economic promot@@ er U@@ ta Sei@@ m @-@ Schwar@@ tz and A@@ sen@@ dor@@ fs mayor Hein@@ fried Kab@@ bert are also pleased about this . &quot;
&quot; in many places in the country , doctors - A@@ sen@@ dorf , on the other hand , are missing : there , Dr. Frank Müller takes over the practice of Fel@@ den@@ ausen on 1 October . &quot;
&quot; while Ur@@ sel &apos;s reti@@ ring goes into retirement , her husband Karl @-@ Heinrich is still at the side of his successor during the next few months . &quot;
&quot; after a reconstruction phase , Müller re@@ opened the practice on 12 October , until then , he inv@@ ests 3@@ 10@@ 000 euros in the premises at St. Mar@@ cell@@ us@@ straße 6 . &quot;
&quot; it was sympathy at first sight when the Fel@@ lowship of Fel@@ lows met before years Frank Müller and his wife Dr. Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ gol@@ l , who is currently taking part in her training in the Ver@@ den Hospital and who wants to enter into practice at the same time . &quot;
&quot; we always had in mind that the mil@@ ler would fit well into this practice , &quot; says Dr. Ur@@ sel Scho@@ er@@ breaks and laughs . &quot;
&quot; when it was time , I just called it . &quot;
the couple Mu@@ eller liked the idea of running his own practice in A@@ sen@@ dorf in the future .
&quot; the proximity and constant contact with the patients are very attractive to us , &quot; says the 39 @-@ year @-@ old mil@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; we want to get to know and accompany the families over the years . &quot;
as an advantage he also see to be his own boss .
and so they agreed that the garbage cans bought the house with the practice .
&quot; however , they will continue to live in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; the two @-@ time family father Frank Müller grew up there , following his medical studies in Hannover followed by stations in several medical practices as well as in hospitals in Sul@@ ingen , Ni@@ enburg and Rot@@ enburg . &quot;
&quot; he is currently active as a Senior Physi@@ cian in Sul@@ ingen , and in 2009 he was appointed Senior Consult@@ ant in the Di@@ ep@@ holz Group and is involved in the D@@ RK prepar@@ edness in Bruch@@ hausen @-@ Vil@@ sen . &quot;
&quot; from 19th September onwards , the practice will be prepared for the new boss . &quot;
&quot; during the surgeon Dr. Karl @-@ Heinrich Fel@@ steh@@ ausen works as a family doctor , his wife Ur@@ sel ( intern@@ ist ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ology . &quot;
&quot; the rub@@ b@@ ish , both inter@@ ne@@ sts , want to settle down as v@@ ets . &quot;
&quot; the endos@@ copy comes out , &quot; says the 38 @-@ year @-@ old Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ dol@@ a . &quot;
&quot; after the conversion , the rooms will look more modern . &quot;
we will offer more ultrasound examinations as well as long @-@ term and resili@@ ent EK@@ Gs and need a speaking room more .
&quot; in addition , the ED@@ V is completely renewed . &quot;
&quot; a grant of a total of 50,000 euros will get the rub@@ b@@ ish in the framework of a funding program from the County ( 25@@ 000 Euro ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) and the municipality ( 12@@ 500 euros ) . &quot;
&quot; this shows how proud and happy we are , that the practice will continue , &quot; emphas@@ ises Sam@@ s@@ Commun@@ ard mayor Bernd Bor@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; according to Silvia Müller @-@ Gon@@ per@@ l , approximately 2000 patients come into practice in the field of rock breaks every quarter , in the North German average practice it is about 500 . &quot;
in A@@ sen@@ dorf there is another medical practice .
a positive side effect of the practice takeover by Frank Müller : the pharmacy remains according to Ur@@ sel Fel@@ den@@ ausen in A@@ sen@@ dorf .
&quot; if no successor was found , it would have gone too . &quot;
&quot; who visits Müll@@ ers consultation hours , by the way , also continues to look at familiar faces : take over the seven medical experts and the cleaning power of the ri@@ ms . &quot;
&quot; with their departure in A@@ sen@@ dorf an era , after all , the doctors have practiced for 30 years . &quot;
&quot; in the beginning we had only two rooms , &quot; Ur@@ sel says , smiling . &quot;
&quot; a little melanch@@ oly , she already felt after the long time . &quot;
&quot; but we continue to live in Hohen@@ mo@@ or and will certainly see many patients , &quot; says the intern@@ ist . &quot;
her husband adds : &quot; we have a 6000 square meter property . &quot;
&quot; so far I have always pressed myself before gardening , now it could be different . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the pair has two grand@@ children and is happy to travel . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; we leave the refugees &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; now the border controls are also made up at our southern border , &quot; said Minister of the Interior Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner . &quot;
the controls on the Hungarian border remain in parallel .
&quot; it is clear , however , that anyone who wants to make a request for asylum can do this &quot; of course . &quot; &quot;
the care and safety of the people is in the foreground .
&quot; but it is clear also that it needs clear signals , &quot; &quot; said the Minister . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; people must know that we do not accept limit@@ less migration flows , not even over the Austrian @-@ Sloven@@ ian border . &quot;
it needs a controlled approach .
Croatia has been denied &quot; Cor@@ ri@@ dor &quot; - Slovenia refused
&quot; the Croatian government had previously announced that Slovenia wants to continue to travel to Austria and Germany in the direction of Austria and Germany , and may also establish corri@@ dors for the refugees . &quot;
&quot; the interior minister Ves@@ na Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ s Z@@ ni@@ dar in Lai@@ bach , however , did not look like this . &quot;
&quot; the idea of corri@@ dors is &quot; &quot; absolutely unacceptable &quot; , &quot; Slovenia rather will intensi@@ fy the supervision of the border - especially in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , the border with Croatia is already strongly controlled as the outer border of the Schengen area . &quot;
&quot; as the minister pointed out , Slovenia wants to avoid its borders for refugees . &quot;
&quot; every member of the EU must fulfil its obligations , otherwise the system cannot function , &quot; said Gy@@ ör@@ kö@@ z Z@@ ni@@ dar . &quot;
&quot; as the Croatian government announced , the first refugees had already tried during the night hours on Tuesday to arrive in eastern Croatia at the border crossing of T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik / S@@ id , to avoid registration . &quot;
the Croatian police could attack it in the nearby maize fields .
&quot; according to local media , the Croatian T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik ever met police vehicles with new refugees . &quot;
&quot; it mainly concerns Syrians and Afgh@@ ans , including numerous women and children . &quot;
rescue services and the Red Cross are already in use .
&quot; in the coming days , his country reck@@ ons with some 4,000 refugees , said Interior Minister R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
&quot; in addition , buses from Pres@@ evo were transferred to the Mac@@ ed@@ onian @-@ Serbian border , which had previously led migrants to the Hungarian border , and reported Croatian and Serbian media on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; the government in Belgrade , however , denied that it was it that people approach certain routes : &quot; neither can we , nor do we want to do this , &quot; it was said . &quot;
&quot; according to media reports , in the morning , a first bus with about 50 refugees arrived in the Serbian border town of S@@ id , in the course of the day more buses would be expected . &quot;
&quot; via Croatia , Slovenia and Austria to Germany &quot;
&quot; the occup@@ ants were on the way all night away from the Mac@@ ed@@ onian border , which was approximately 500 kilometres away . &quot;
&quot; we heard that Hungary was admitted , so the police said that we should go here , &quot; &quot; said one of the refugees . &quot;
&quot; they wanted to travel to Germany through Croatia , Slovenia and Austria . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the postpon@@ ement of the previous Balkan Route Turkey @-@ Greece @-@ Macedonia @-@ Serbia @-@ Hungary could now come to a somewhat further west @-@ west route . &quot;
&quot; Croatia : &quot; &quot; comprehensive possibilities for border control &quot; &quot; &quot;
Croatia &apos;s Interior Minister O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic had stressed earlier that his country had prepared appropriate plans for possible exemp@@ tions in the event of a strong influ@@ x of refugees .
&quot; he did not mention the details , but pointed out that Croatia as a non @-@ Schengen member has &quot; &quot; comprehensive opportunities for border control &quot; . &quot; &quot;
strict controls are performed to qualify for membership in the Schengen area .
&quot; Slovenia has been part of this since 2007 , the EU partners have consistently issued a good testimony to the country , regarding the standard of border controls . &quot;
&quot; on the Serbian side , about 300 refugees are stuck behind the Hungarian border fence . &quot;
&quot; according to Belgrade &apos;s media reports , they have spent the past night at the border crossing Hor@@ gos , which leads to R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; according to the Hungarian authorities , the two border cross@@ ings of Hor@@ gos and Back@@ i Bre@@ g remain completely closed . &quot;
whether the remaining refugees now want to travel to the Croatian border is still unclear .
&quot; the Serbian Minister of Interior , N@@ ebo@@ j@@ sa Stef@@ an@@ ovic , still tried to calm Wednesday at a local evi@@ ction in Hor@@ gos : he kept the debates on the alternative routes of refugees , after the Hungarian border is now closed . &quot;
it would not be about very high refugee figures at this time .
&quot; one could not yet say whether they would continue their journey through Hungary , Croatia or any other country . &quot;
hel@@ pers advise migrants - dangerous - alternative routes
&quot; however , private Hungarian refugee shel@@ ters have already begun distributing maps to the refugees on which alternative routes are marked by Croatia . &quot;
&quot; however , the border crossing between Serbia and Croatia is not dangerous : in parts of the bor@@ der@@ land there are still not cleared mine fields twenty years after the end of the Croatian war . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday afternoon , the Croatian police announced that a team of mine clear@@ ers was sent to the border region . &quot;
stock H@@ acker : Ukra@@ inians pay 30 million dollars
&quot; Sup@@ ran@@ on@@ ok is said to have heard a ring of cy@@ ber criminals , who is accused of getting an insight into un@@ published financial statements and press releases on websites such as Business Wire , Market@@ place and PR News@@ wire since 2010 . &quot;
&quot; with the captured information , insi@@ der business should have been made on the financial markets . &quot;
&quot; in this way , a total of more than 100 million dollars were launched to the investig@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; today &apos;s comparison shows that even those outside our country borders will ultimately be caught , &quot; says the SE@@ C release . &quot;
the trials against 32 other defend@@ ants in the case continued .
most of the defend@@ ants were from Ukraine and Georgia .
the perpetr@@ ators were to have acted both in the United States and Eastern Europe .
ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce help Mannheim has existed for 20 years
there is a lively operation all around the Mannheim Par@@ ade@@ platz .
&quot; the people carry out their concerns , partly fast steps , partly comfortably stro@@ lling . &quot;
they control the two stations of the Mannheim car park at the Par@@ ade@@ platz .
keep City Rail@@ ways .
&quot; puls@@ ating , boun@@ tiful life with beautiful autumn sunshine and in the middle four large tables each with the heading &quot; Before I die I want to die .... &quot; &quot;
&quot; with this action , the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid drew attention to its 20th anniversary and is quite well confronted with mixed reactions . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s about life , so we went with the action in the middle of the city and among the people , &quot; says Jos@@ ef@@ ine Lam@@ mer . &quot;
the head of the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid is available to the pass@@ ers @-@ by as well as questions and talks as the volunteer staff .
&quot; while some pedestri@@ ans spontaneously acc@@ use the chal@@ k and &quot; &quot; read my life &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; , &quot; &quot; &quot; stop the war &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; not suffer long &quot; , &quot; others remain short , read , say sentences like &quot; &quot; I &apos;m not yet &quot; &quot; and then go on . &quot;
&quot; on the ver@@ ge of little discussion about the action itself , about life , dealing with dying . &quot;
also Peter H@@ üb@@ inger is on site .
&quot; only when I realize that at some point the end of this world comes to me , I can live responsi@@ bly , &quot; &quot; says the Director of the Di@@ ak@@ onian work Mannheim , which together with the Car@@ it@@ as@@ verband is the bearer of the ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid . &quot;
&quot; therefore , this public @-@ effective action is good for the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; however , it is a very personal thing that everyone does not want to publicly express themselves on the tables . &quot;
&quot; the theme of death and death is still cl@@ inging to tab@@ oos , so the experience of Jos@@ ef@@ ine lam@@ mer , even though the hos@@ pi@@ ce movement in recent years has contributed a lot to the opening of people . &quot;
an estim@@ ation that An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid shares .
the death and mour@@ ning atten@@ dant is one of the volunteers of the first hour .
&quot; through personal experience with the subject , she read a lot of literature and decided to get involved in eu@@ than@@ asia . &quot;
&quot; when the E@@ cum@@ en@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce aid was requested by the call of volunteers , she immediately reported and participated in the founding in 1995 . &quot;
&quot; Go@@ def@@ roid is a team of 45 volunteers - 43 women and two men - those affected and relatives in private households , hospitals , nursing homes and in the Hos@@ pi@@ z Saint Vincent . &quot;
they all have been carefully trained .
An@@ geli@@ ka Go@@ def@@ roid can deal well with her job and the experiences and experiences he has made .
&quot; I see life from another point of view , consider it precious and appreciate the moment , &quot; she says . &quot;
the offer of the out@@ patient ec@@ umen@@ ical hos@@ pi@@ ce service is free of charge and denom@@ in@@ ational .
the financial support of the health insur@@ ers and donations of relatives and clubs allows the training as well as further training and supervision of the death and mour@@ ning aid .
training for new employees is offered every two years .
&quot; the tables described on Saturday are now exhibited in the House of the Evangel@@ ical Church ( M1 , 1@@ a ) and in the House of the Catholic Church ( F@@ 2 , 6 ) . &quot;
&quot; also there , further personal wishes can be written on postcards . &quot;
F@@ ed@@ Ex result mixed with financial prospects for 2016
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex reports dis@@ ap@@ pointing results for the last quarter , and the delivery @-@ gi@@ ants lowered his profit prospects for a whole year due to the weaker demand for freight services and higher costs in his body transport service . &quot;
&quot; the company also said that it plans to hire about 55@@ ,000 seasonal workers for holidays . &quot;
&quot; at that time last year , F@@ ed@@ Ex announced that the company would like to hire 50,000 seasonal workers for the holiday season . &quot;
the share fell by over 2.5 percent in pre @-@ market trading 45 minutes before the opening on Wednesday .
&quot; F@@ ed@@ Ex Corp. said to earn a profit between $ 10,@@ 40 and $ 10.@@ 90 in the fiscal year ending next May , 20 c@@ ents less than in previous forecast . &quot;
analysts expected a 10.@@ 84 $ survey of fac@@ t@@ set .
&quot; despite the increase in price increases , the average prospect will be 4.@@ 9 percent and effective on 4 January and despite higher rates for bo@@ d@@ ging transport of heavy and large packages , which will be le@@ vi@@ ed from November . &quot;
&quot; the company said it nonetheless expected that the result would increase compared to the previous year due to cost reduction , higher revenue and due to growth in online retail . &quot;
&quot; Chairman and CEO Fred Smith said that the company is generating solid earnings if one considers the weaker than expected economic conditions , especially in manufacturing and global trade . &quot;
&quot; the plans for holiday @-@ employment were announced one day later than that of the rival U@@ PS , which plans to hire 90@@ ,000 to 9@@ 5,000 additional workers , such as the same number as last year . &quot;
&quot; in the quarter , which ended on 31 August , F@@ ed@@ Ex earned 6@@ 92 million $ , 6 percent more than in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; earnings per share stood at $ 2.@@ 42 per share , just below the $ 2.@@ 44 per share , predic@@ ting twelve analysts from Z@@ acks Investment Research . &quot;
sales increased by 5 percent to $ 12.@@ 3 billion .
six of Z@@ acks questioned the expected 12,@@ 23 billion $ . &quot;
&quot; in recent years , F@@ ed@@ Ex has recorded a decline in international preferred shipping , which boo@@ sted sales in its unit Express shipment . &quot;
but the boom in online shopping increased the results at F@@ ed@@ Ex Ground .
&quot; in the last quarter , net sales increased by 29 percent , but the operating result was basically flat due to higher costs for larger par@@ c@@ els and self @-@ insurance . &quot;
&quot; the express unit recorded higher revenue owing to higher prices , while the result decreased due to higher operating costs in the cargo business . &quot;
&quot; in pre @-@ market trading , approximately one hour before the opening , the F@@ ed@@ Ex shares ten@@ dered by $ 3.@@ 85 , or 2.5 percent , to $ 15@@ 0.@@ 15 . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , they closed with 11 percent loss for the year and 17 percent under a record high on 11 June . &quot;
&quot; on their most anticipated meeting in the year , Federal Reserve Strate@@ gen spend two days this week around a 27 foot Hondur@@ an ma@@ ho@@ gan@@ y table to decide whether it is time to raise interest rates for the first time for almost a decade . &quot;
&quot; a mur@@ al of the United States is at the end of the decorated , two @-@ stor@@ ey@@ ed sitting hall . &quot;
the map is a reminder that the F@@ ed chairman Jan@@ et L. Y@@ ellen and her colleagues should expose the economic interests of the nation to all other things .
the central bank has a double order from Congress : maxim@@ ising US employment and prices here .
&quot; but since the big recession , the F@@ ed leaders have acknowledged that there is an un@@ written third mandate : financial stability . &quot;
this third mandate could be the X factor in a decision that is too tight to predict it . it will be announced on Thursday whether the US economy is ready to be we@@ aned from the unprecedented incentive by the close to zero short @-@ term interest rate since the end of 2008 .
&quot; although most of the economy &apos;s data show that it grows solid , the recent turbul@@ ence on the global financial markets could make the already cau@@ tious F@@ ed representatives anxious to strengthen this volati@@ lity by raising the interest for federal bonds - and be it only a quarter of a percentage point . &quot;
&quot; obviously the labour market and inflation in the first place will be the most important thing they see , &quot; said Lind@@ sey M. Pi@@ eg@@ za , chief econom@@ ist at the bro@@ ker@@ age company Sti@@ fel Nicol@@ aus &amp; Co . &quot;
&quot; but I think if they were looking for a pre@@ text to not increase the interest rate , the increased in@@ security around the global market is enough justification to continue &quot; , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; there is no consensus on what the F@@ ed will do , which insur@@ es the financial market itself . &quot;
&quot; about half of the econom@@ ists , who were recently inter@@ viewed by Blo@@ om@@ berg , have predicted an increase in interest this week . &quot;
&quot; financial markets , however , expect a wait for the F@@ ed , with a key indicator that indicates only a 30 % chance for an increase . &quot;
&quot; this indicates a decline in the stock market if the F@@ ed increases the proposition unless the strate@@ gi@@ sts mi@@ tig@@ ate the blow , promising that another increase is far removed . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage jumped by 2@@ 28@@ ,@@ 89 points or 1.4 % to 16,@@ 59@@ 9,@@ 85 . &quot;
&quot; the action was triggered by expectations that the F@@ ed policy maintains the sentence this week , &quot; said John Lon@@ ski , chief econom@@ ist at M@@ oo@@ dy &apos;s Capital Markets Research Group . &quot;
&quot; it would be a surprise if the F@@ ed would raise the sentences at this point , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; if she does , &quot; &quot; she would have to go very far in her explanation to so@@ ot@@ he the financial markets so that they don &apos;t panic . &quot;
other experts argued that an increase in interest would ease the financial markets because they would eliminate the uncertainty about when the F@@ ed will act .
&quot; a month ago , the F@@ ed seemed on a good way to increase the sentence by 0.@@ 25 percentage points this month , the first small step in a slow intensi@@ fication of monetary conditions that would test the strength of recovery in the US . &quot;
&quot; in spring and early summer , Y@@ ella had said that this year , despite the complaints of liber@@ als , it would require more economic progress to increase the rate . &quot;
&quot; although job creation slow@@ ed down in August , the improvement in the labour market was solid this year . &quot;
&quot; the unemployment rate fell to 5.1 % last month , the lowest for more than seven years and close to the level the F@@ ed sees as full employment . &quot;
wage increases have shown signs of recovery .
&quot; although inflation was constantly below the annual target of 2 % of the central bank , the F@@ ed representatives said that the main reason was the temporary effects of significantly lower oil prices . &quot;
&quot; the economy &quot; can cope with higher interest rates and needs it because of tension in the labour market , &quot; said Ian Sh@@ ep@@ her@@ dson , chief econom@@ ist at Pan@@ the@@ on Mac@@ ro@@ economics . &quot;
but the financial markets around the world sent together at the end of last month after China had de@@ valu@@ ated its currency .
the Dow Jones Industrial A@@ verage Requi@@ rement fell by more than 16 % in May when investors were afraid that a slow@@ down of the Chinese economy would th@@ rot@@ tle global growth .
&quot; the market has recovered slightly this month , which is now almost 10 % below the top of May . &quot;
&quot; for the F@@ ed representatives , market turbul@@ ences affect the complex calculation when the interest should be increased . &quot;
&quot; if the events on the financial markets and the news about the weakness of the Chinese economy had not occurred in the last few weeks , they would tigh@@ ten the re@@ ins at this meeting , &quot; said Stephen D. O@@ liner , Senior Research Fel@@ low at the U@@ C@@ LA Zim@@ an Center for Real Estate and a former employee of the US staff . &quot;
now he predic@@ ts that she will wait at least one month to get the impact better .
&quot; there is a lot of uncertainty about what the impact on the U.S. economy will be , and there are almost no reliable data describing the developments in China , &quot; said O@@ liners . &quot;
&quot; the world economy &apos;s health is not one of the main concerns of the F@@ ed , therefore it should not be included in the decision @-@ making process . &quot;
but in the end the F@@ ed currency authority of the world has become .
the influence of the central bank was enormous in recent years .
&quot; the mere hint of the former leader Ben S. Bern@@ anke in 2013 , that the F@@ ed could &quot; narrow &quot; their monetary expansion , caused confusion around the globe . &quot;
&quot; in a world where markets and economies are increasingly inter@@ tw@@ ined , the F@@ ed representatives are expected to super@@ v@@ ise not only the developments elsewhere , but also with other central banks and experts to gain a better understanding of the global economy . &quot;
&quot; her decision @-@ making is &quot; more art than science , &quot; said Zach@@ ary Kar@@ ab@@ ell , head of the global strategy for asset management at En@@ v@@ est@@ net Inc . &quot;
&quot; Jeff@@ rey Lack@@ ier , President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Rich@@ mond , VA . , noted this month that &quot; the F@@ ed has a history of over@@ reactions to financial market movements , apparently not associated with the economic fundament@@ als . &quot;
&quot; coater , voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee , which advoc@@ ates for an increase in interest , cited Dec@@ isions in the years 1998 / 1999 as an example . &quot;
&quot; a financial crisis in Asia brought the F@@ ed to lower its lending rate by 0.@@ 75 percentage points in three sessions &quot; despite limited dis@@ cer@@ ni@@ ble impact on growth in the US , &quot; said Lack@@ er . &quot;
a year later the F@@ ed representatives cancelled these cuts .
&quot; the F@@ ed should first place aspects of financial stability only during a severe crisis such as the collapse of the market in 2008 , &quot; said Adam S. P@@ osen , a former member of the Committee for the Inter@@ est Investment Bank of England . &quot;
&quot; the latest turbul@@ ences do not come near this level , he said . &quot;
&quot; she certainly doesn &apos;t want to get into the situation in which she is afraid of an increase in interest because the markets are upset , &quot; said P@@ osen , President of Peter@@ son Institute for International Economics . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Reserve Act still contains the double mandate and does not mention financial stability , and until that is changed , I don &apos;t think it should rush ahead . &quot;
do you need a great Thai market ?
try LA@@ X @-@ C in Chin@@ at@@ own .
&quot; yes , Chin@@ at@@ own &quot;
the market / warehouse was opened in 1997 and is owned by LA@@ X @-@ C Inc .
&quot; LA@@ X @-@ C is often referred to as Thai Co@@ st@@ co and is a Thai wholesale market , which is also sold to the general public . &quot;
&quot; yes , it is located in Chin@@ at@@ own and not in Thai Town . &quot;
&quot; the market / warehouse is a central point of contact and offers a conf@@ using number of fresh , frozen and dried goods , popular Thai and Asian snacks , and dishes , furniture , religious jewellery and Christmas decorations . &quot;
there is even a car division if you need engine oil .
&quot; the shop is huge , and it takes about an hour to stroll through the corri@@ dors . &quot;
&quot; if the whole shopping spre@@ e makes you hungry , there is a meal in the LA@@ X @-@ C BBQ Express . &quot;
the G@@ ark@@ ü@@ che ( good and cheap ) in this shop is close to the till@@ s and has various sympathy options .
what is there : do you need something - anything - Thai ?
LA@@ X @-@ C probably has it .
products are cheap and a number of them are sold in large quantities .
&quot; fresh products include Asian specialities and regional Thai herbs , fruit and much more . &quot;
the meat bar is extensive as well as the fish counter - the staff behind the counter will clean and fil@@ e@@ ze the fish and even fry on request for you .
&quot; a good part of the store belongs to the massive freezing department . here you will find frozen cur@@ ry leaves , bitter mel@@ on and gal@@ anga , whole du@@ cks , fish , beef blood and g@@ all , pork cre@@ ams , regional saus@@ age , commercially prepared food and more . &quot;
&quot; who bu@@ ys here : restaurant owners and coo@@ ks , also individual families and individuals . &quot;
the wide corri@@ dors are suitable for trol@@ leys and fork @-@ lift trucks .
you will find here : fresh Mon@@ th@@ ong Dur@@ ian next to the cas@@ hier .
&quot; where it is located : the shop is located in an industrial area of Los Angeles on the edge of Chin@@ at@@ own and downtown , a few blocks away from Philippe The Original . &quot;
parking : LA@@ X @-@ C has its own parking area along with other shops and restaurants .
&quot; even if the shop is well attended , it is not difficult to find a parking place . &quot;
Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da : small Aid for Refu@@ ge@@ es
more and more refugees arrive in Germany these days .
&quot; to prepare a warm welcome , do not go without the commitment of countless volunteers . &quot;
also in Ho@@ y@@ ers@@ wer@@ da there are a number of people who support un@@ sel@@ fish asylum seekers in the city .
they include Petra and Klaus H@@ eine .
Petra H@@ eine is a teacher with body and soul .
she still likes to teach with her 74 lic@@ ences .
every Thursday she is doing it at the asylum seek@@ er at D@@ ill@@ inger Straße .
&quot; there they help refugees from Syria , Kurdist@@ an , Kosovo and Pakistan to learn the German language . &quot;
&quot; of course , this is quite a different lesson than in a real school . &quot;
Brazil &apos;s Pap@@ al Society Rio Grande promotes healthy breast@@ feeding
&quot; the Brazilian pedi@@ atric organisation SP@@ RS tries to inform women in a sho@@ cking manner about how important good nutrition is during the lac@@ tation period . it does this with the presentation of images of babies , which su@@ ck at breasts that are painted with representations of un@@ healthy foods . &quot;
&quot; breast milk consists of a variety of proteins , fats , vitamins and carbohydrates that give babies all the nutrients they need to build a strong immune system . &quot;
&quot; due to the additional energy requirements , pregnant women and young mothers are advised to increase their daily cal@@ orie intake by about 500 calories per day . &quot;
&quot; however , new research suggests that higher cal@@ orie intake is not the only dietary modification that mothers should make . &quot;
&quot; a recent study conducted by Robert Water@@ land , Professor at Ba@@ yl@@ or College of Medicine in Texas , showed that a healthy diet in pregnant women actually affects the genes of their babies and protects them from developing tum@@ ors . &quot;
&quot; unfortunately , an un@@ healthy diet of the child can adver@@ sely affect the immune system . &quot;
exceptions for the new Bern@@ rie@@ der Spor@@ thalle
the municipal council Bern@@ ried approved the construction application for the 2.3 million euros expensive sports hall .
and he made an exception .
the roof must be fl@@ atter for solar panels .
&quot; the plans for the long @-@ awaited turn@@ around construction at the Bern@@ rie@@ der Sports site are progres@@ sing step by step : in the recent municipal meeting , the completed construction application was unanim@@ ously approved without any large discussions . &quot;
&quot; prior to that , the committee had yet decided to apply for an &quot; &quot; legal &quot; &quot; exemp@@ tion &quot; &quot; or &quot; &quot; deliver@@ ance &quot; &quot; from the valid planning plan . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; &quot; exception &quot; &quot; was the permission for a special form concerning the roof construction . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , a &quot; &quot; saddle roof with non @-@ cent@@ red First and roof over@@ stand &quot; &quot; should be built . &quot;
&quot; the planning is the planned use of the roof surface for solar plants : &quot; this way we get a wonderfully large southern roof , &quot; said Mayor Josef St@@ eigen@@ berger at the meeting . &quot;
&quot; the &quot; liberation &quot; in turn , in turn , was about the roof inclin@@ ation , which was dict@@ ated by energy reasons - unlike in the construction plan - below ten degrees . &quot;
this significantly reduces the volume of the hall .
&quot; &quot; &quot; liberation &quot; &quot; was therefore necessary because the plan for the roof inclin@@ ation allows no &quot; exceptions , &quot; whereby the Bern@@ rie@@ der Municipal Council is generally rather restric@@ tive in the case of exemp@@ tion . &quot;
&quot; this is not a recurring project : &quot; &quot; we do not create preced@@ ence , &quot; &quot; St@@ eigen@@ berger said . &quot;
the sports centre at the Sports Centre is a joint project of the municipality and of the S@@ V Bern@@ ried .
&quot; at the expense of costs , some 2.3 million euros have been calculated . &quot;
grants are expected from school and mass sports .
&quot; in the next process step , the building application for the 18 x 36 @-@ metre hall is now presented to the Federal Council of Agriculture . &quot;
clinic P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg moves to Sch@@ ong@@ au
the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital is planned to be closed earlier than planned - in 2016 .
&quot; at the same time , Dr. Wilhelm Fischer ( 66 ) is the new medical director at the Sch@@ ong@@ au Hospital . &quot;
the station and the majority of employees move from P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg to Sch@@ ong@@ au .
&quot; this shows the surprising plans of the hospital GmbH of the county , confirmed by the Coun@@ cill@@ or Andrea J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
&quot; the Supervisory Board , however , will make a decision on this , and he will meet on the following Wednesday , 23 September . &quot;
&quot; should the plans be implemented , then all of the nearly 50 employees would be employed at the hospital in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg . &quot;
the overwhelming majority should move to Sch@@ ong@@ au with Fischer and the further existing In@@ ner Station .
the rooms are available .
&quot; employees , who are not able to go to Sch@@ ong@@ au , should be offered a workplace in Wei@@ l@@ heim , so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
the employees are informed of the plans .
&quot; the change has triggered the dis@@ mis@@ sal of Dr. Andreas E@@ der , who has only been the medical director of the Sch@@ ong@@ auer hospital since the beginning of the year and now changes to a private practice in close proximity to the hospital . &quot;
&quot; according to J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , the name &quot; Fischer &quot; came into play on the question of who will succeed , who agreed to take over the lead from 1 October , and to switch to Sch@@ ong@@ au with his team . &quot;
&quot; for the house in Sch@@ ong@@ au , this means a &quot; &quot; upgrade &quot; &quot; and a wi@@ dening of the offer in the area &quot; &quot; Internal Medicine &quot; , &quot; so J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß . &quot;
Fischer is a specialist for pac@@ em@@ akers and de@@ fi@@ bri@@ ll@@ ators .
Sch@@ ong@@ au ( 180 beds ) special@@ ises in gastro@@ enter@@ ological diseases .
&quot; for the next two years , when the Supervisory Board agrees with his team , when the Supervisory Board agrees to agree on both houses , the former hospital of the Kn@@ app@@ ie , which has more than 35 beds , will finally be closed in P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg after nearly 140 years . &quot;
&quot; until now , the District Court had planned this for 2018 , if the current rehabilitation at Wei@@ l@@ heim hospital is currently being completed . &quot;
&quot; J@@ och@@ ner @-@ Weiß , who is also Chairman of the Supervisory Board , met rum@@ ors that the house , which is in possession of the federal government , will in future be used as accommodation for asylum seekers . &quot;
&quot; as it continues with the real estate , J@@ och@@ ner @-@ White could not say there were several considerations . &quot;
currently there is a short @-@ term care of the Car@@ itas and a daily sy@@ chiat@@ ry .
&quot; what better could not happen to us , such an opportunity does not come again , &quot; &quot; says Fischer about the quasi @-@ move to the Le@@ ch , who had been welcomed by the employees &quot; &quot; positive and very understanding &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; a real perspective for the house , where fishermen have been working as a doctor for over 30 years , have not given it . &quot;
he was asked by Sch@@ ong@@ auer &apos;s colleagues to take over the post of the medical director .
&quot; in the past decades , the P@@ ei@@ ßen@@ berg Hospital ( once 100 beds ) has been threatened by closure , departments were closed , for example the surgery and ob@@ st@@ et@@ rics . &quot;
the hand b@@ aller of the Rhein @-@ Neck@@ ar Leu@@ ven are called for the Berg@@ ische HC tonight ( 8.@@ 15 pm ) .
&quot; the ranking leader of the Bundes@@ liga , in Wuppertal , is the clear favorite , but none of them insi@@ sts . &quot;
&quot; in the past season , the ba@@ thers at Bh@@ c had a painful defeat and made something good there . &quot;
hunting flight with two injured at Pr@@ at@@ au
two tractor drivers were severely injured during their maize harvest on Tuesday afternoon .
&quot; during the super@@ sti@@ tion on a corn field near Pr@@ at@@ au ( district Witt@@ enberg ) , several hunters were in action , as the police announced . &quot;
after a shot a 63@@ - and a 22 @-@ year @-@ old man suffered serious injuries and were brought to hospitals .
how exactly it could happen to the accident was unclear at first .
the Criminal Police determined .
missing 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate victims of violent crimes
a suspect has led the police to the corp@@ se of 16 @-@ year @-@ old from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate who has been missing since Saturday .
&quot; in interro@@ gation , the 20 @-@ year @-@ old had killed the young people and threw their corp@@ ses into a channel in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen . &quot;
a 16 @-@ year @-@ old missing from Rhin@@ eland @-@ Pal@@ at@@ inate has fallen victim to violence .
&quot; the corp@@ se of the young woman was found on Tuesday evening in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen near Kais@@ ers@@ lau@@ tern , such as public prosec@@ ut@@ ors and police on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in fact , a 20 @-@ year @-@ old as@@ cer@@ tained also on Tuesday evening , who , in fact , was given the indication , and the investig@@ ators led to the discovery site of the corp@@ se . &quot;
the 16 @-@ year @-@ old was reported missing on Sunday morning after they did not come home after visiting an autumn festival in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen .
&quot; in search of the young woman , the investig@@ ators first launched the victim &apos;s personal bel@@ ong@@ ings . &quot;
&quot; in the case of interro@@ gations in the circle of friends and acquain@@ tan@@ ces of the suspi@@ ci@@ ons , there was finally a suspicion against the 20 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
the alleged perpetr@@ ator then led the police to a canal in Rock@@ enh@@ ausen where the corp@@ se was found .
&quot; the ceremony was reported to the authorities in police interro@@ gation , who killed 16 @-@ year @-@ old and put the corp@@ se into the canal . &quot;
&quot; the 20 @-@ year @-@ old was to be introduced to the Haf@@ tar on Wednesday , and the investig@@ ators put a total burden on him . &quot;
&quot; as a matter of fact , the further investigations are to be carried out . &quot;
refugees need accommodation : study warns of housing loan
the situation on the German housing market is ten@@ se .
more and more refugees are looking for affordable accommodation .
the pressure on the housing market is growing .
social housing is facing a challenge .
distribution struggles on the German housing market have long since begun .
&quot; with the coming refugees and job@@ seekers from the EU , more and more people push for a market that is now over@@ loaded in many large cities . &quot;
they compete with low @-@ income citizens around the last affordable housing .
&quot; in order to meet the demand for affordable housing , 400@@ ,000 new units would have to be built by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; this is the result of a study commissioned by the association &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for comparison : this year , 26@@ 0@@ ,000 units are finished in Germany . &quot;
&quot; this means that 140@@ ,000 homes are missing . &quot;
&quot; after the first three months of their stay , refugees are no longer oblig@@ ated to live as asylum seekers in an initial accommodation . &quot;
many go to the housing market and join the long queu@@ es in front of the apartments .
&quot; according to the Federal Statisti@@ cal Office , however , less than half of all asylum seekers settled in the last year . &quot;
&quot; however , the negative development of the housing market is not only due to the rising number of refugees . &quot;
the study also makes significant failures in the housing policy of recent years .
Germany im@@ poses a housing deficit that is getting bigger from year to year .
&quot; currently there are already around 77@@ ,000 housing units in the metrop@@ olitan areas , compla@@ ining Matthias Günther , author of the study . &quot;
many professionals therefore lived in large cities in WG @-@ rooms .
&quot; due to the l@@ utes on the housing market , young adults remained un@@ intentionally longer in the &quot; &quot; Hotel Mama &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in the large cities , the number of square meters per cap@@ ita in recent years has declined again for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in order to solve the problem , the alliance &quot; &quot; Sozial@@ er housing construction &quot; &quot; proposes a restart . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , new incentives should boost social housing construction . &quot;
&quot; thus , the income tax could be dispens@@ ed with and the basic tax for subsidi@@ zed apartments may be suspended . &quot;
&quot; in addition , attractive tax depreci@@ ation possibilities are necessary according to the Alliance . &quot;
the funding programme for refugee shel@@ ters by the Kf@@ W is already well received by towns and communities .
&quot; a good week after the start , more than half of the available EUR 300 million have already been rec@@ alled on Monday evening with 18@@ 4 million euros . &quot;
now the project could even be increased .
refugees have free money : Croatia and Slovenia conduct corridor
&quot; in Hungary there is practically no passing , since more and more refugees choose the way to Croatia . &quot;
Zagreb announces to pass through Slovenia to the north without hur@@ d@@ les .
but the route is dangerous .
Croatia wants to communicate with neighbouring Slovenia on the establishment of a corridor for refugees .
&quot; I have spoken to the Minister of the Interior , and if necessary , we will organise a corridor , &quot; said Croatian Minister of the Interior , R@@ ank@@ o O@@ sto@@ j@@ ic . &quot;
Slovenia is located between Croatia and Austria and is already part of the Schengen zone .
the EU country of Croatia is not yet a Schengen country .
&quot; after the deportation of the Serbian @-@ Hungarian border , hundreds of refugees came to Croatia to get to Western Europe from there . &quot;
&quot; 500 people came across the border near T@@ ov@@ ar@@ nik , reports the Croatian TV channel RT@@ L . &quot;
Hungary had sealed its border for refugees on the previous day .
&quot; new laws , which came into force on the same day , virtually superf@@ lu@@ ous decent asylum procedures in Hungary . &quot;
Croatia wants to let the refugees pass .
&quot; Croatian Prime Minister Zor@@ an Mil@@ an@@ ovic stated : &quot; &quot; they can travel through , and we are preparing for this possibility . &quot;
&quot; these people are there , there are women , children and men who want to live and achieve something . &quot;
but there are people who did not want to live in Croatia .
&quot; in the morning , the Croatian police attacked the first refugees at Serbia &apos;s border to the EU neighboring country of Croatia . &quot;
&quot; most media reports come from Syria , Iran and Afghanistan . &quot;
they came to the Serbian border town of S@@ id both by bus and with taxes .
&quot; immediately after their arrival , they would have tried to walk over the green border to Croatia . &quot;
&quot; at the Croatian @-@ Serbian border , the refugees do not come across borders . &quot;
there are other dangers in the border : there are sharp mines from the Yugosla@@ vian civil war in the 1990s .
mine clearance is now to quickly create a safe passage .
&quot; in Hungary , however , there are hardly any more refugees after the closure of the border . &quot;
on Tuesday the police counted 3@@ 66 attacked people .
&quot; shortly before the closure on Monday , it was still 9@@ 380 . &quot;
the new Hungarian laws are committed to overcoming and damaging the border zone as a crime .
35 criminal proceedings were initiated in the South @-@ Hungarian border town of Sz@@ eg@@ ed .
the convic@@ ted thre@@ aten prison sentences of up to five years and deportation from the country .
&quot; according to the immigration authority , a total of 94 asylum applications were accepted on Tuesday in the &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ visions &quot; , &quot; of which nearly all - 93 - at the most important transition of R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke . &quot;
&quot; among the applicants , 13 families with small children and two elderly people are included . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday morning , 40 refugees stayed there . &quot;
&quot; practically , no one has a prospect of granting asylum in Hungary . &quot;
&quot; according to Hungarian authorities , Serbia is a &quot; safe third country . &quot; &quot;
the rejected asylum seekers should be deported there .
&quot; before the &quot; &quot; Trans@@ itz@@ one &quot; &quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke only a few hundred refugees assembled . &quot;
&quot; in R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke , workers began to clean up with it . &quot;
they collected rub@@ b@@ ish which tens of thousands of people had left at the road@@ side in the past few weeks .
barrier nets have been disman@@ tled and one of the recording camps in the border area has been rebuilt .
no one wanted to express himself to the goal of this reconstruction .
&quot; after the closing of the border between Serbia and Hungary , Austria only reaches a few refugees . &quot;
the country has also reinforced its border controls .
&quot; but around 20,000 migrants were still in the country , but still in the country . &quot;
&quot; in Salzburg , about 1400 people wait for the journey to Germany . &quot;
train traffic from there to Germany was stopped by the German authorities in the morning .
&quot; in Frei@@ las@@ sing , smaller groups of refugees regularly met on foot . &quot;
mayor drove &quot; str@@ anded &quot; across the border
&quot; we were busy with the clearing after the bridge festival on Sunday when ten people suddenly stood at the entrance of the tent , &quot; &quot; said W@@ ern@@ stein mayor Alo@@ is Stad@@ ler . &quot;
tourists who wanted to travel to Passa@@ u by train .
&quot; but because Germany had surprisingly adjusted the railway traffic with Austria on Sunday , it was in W@@ ern@@ stein an end , &quot; &quot; Stad@@ ler , who immediately offered his help and ch@@ auff@@ eu@@ red the frames with two other hel@@ pers and their cars over the border into the Nah@@ e Passa@@ u . &quot;
&quot; before we cooked the un@@ hoped guests only once , with snack and drinks . &quot;
&quot; we said the same , we bring them to Passa@@ u by car . &quot;
&quot; that was a matter of course for us , &quot; says Stad@@ ler in the O@@ Ö@@ N conversation . &quot;
they were very grateful .
a man refused to give a generous donation - 100 Euro for the fire bri@@ g@@ ade .
&quot; we were very pleased , &quot; &quot; says Stad@@ ler . &quot;
&quot; on Sunday evening in W@@ els , the str@@ anded train passengers had switched from an ICE into a regional train to Passa@@ u , in order to stop it after the announcement that the railway traffic to Germany was stopped , but still crossing the border . &quot;
&quot; however , the regional train was placed in front of the border in W@@ ern@@ stein am Inn . &quot;
&quot; in W@@ ern@@ stein , the border crossing generally is high in the course . &quot;
&quot; the Brück@@ en@@ fest association with the Bavarian neighbours on Sunday soci@@ able , day before a two @-@ brid@@ le sporty - organized by the Union W@@ ern@@ stein and Bayern from Neu@@ kirchen . &quot;
that Viktor Or@@ b@@ án has now sent thousands of thousands to us is a logical result of a hypo@@ critical policy :
&quot; instead of helping R@@ ös@@ z@@ ke to help establishing structures that ensure humanity , our Federal Chancellor has publicly and publicly tra@@ cked the position of the Hungarian government in the Dun@@ st@@ kreis of National Socialism . &quot;
leaders of this policy are not only those Austri@@ ans who are now confronted with chaotic conditions in the border areas .
&quot; even the refugees will have to find that the &quot; &quot; promised land &quot; , &quot; which she has invited and welcomed , is nothing but a further refugee camp . &quot;
&quot; it will be a big challenge , given the ongoing flows of refugees and the approaching winter to produce decent conditions for protection @-@ seekers . &quot;
&quot; and it will be even greater - to maintain peace , security and stability in Austria . &quot;
&quot; Konrad in search of 35@@ ,000 win@@ try lod@@ gings &quot;
&quot; with the aid of refugees , Konrad has to do all his hands full . &quot;
Christian Konrad is used to having his word weight .
the government has used the former powerful Rai@@ ff@@ eisen ban@@ ker to place quot@@ as for thousands of refugees .
Konrad has already got a grip on the chaos at the Tra@@ is@@ kirchen first recep@@ tion@@ ist .
&quot; we have no homeless people in Tra@@ is@@ kirchen , &quot; he reported about his first success . &quot;
&quot; the lodging of the 20,000 refugees who came to Austria on Monday was also carried out without a great host , said Konrad and praised the organisational &quot; master performance . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Interior Ministry , on the other hand , spoke of a &quot; crisis @-@ like situation . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Konrad employs a total of 85@@ ,000 quarters in the he@@ ur@@ ary year . &quot;
&quot; in order to fulfil the number , 3@@ 5.000 properties have to be found in the coming weeks - 20,000 should provide the Länder , 15,000 of the Con@@ federation . &quot;
&quot; should there be more refugees , we can do it . &quot;
&quot; but it is not a barrel without ground , &quot; &quot; said Konrad . &quot;
he has already had talks with the provincial capitals .
&quot; they would have assured him , even for the coming refugees , Qu@@ arti@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; in Upper Austria it works well , &quot; said Fer@@ ry Mai@@ er . &quot;
the former VP @-@ Mand@@ at@@ ary supports Konrad .
&quot; tomorrow there will be a meeting with Cardinal Christoph Schön@@ born , and it will be clari@@ fied how the Church will help . &quot;
&quot; the asylum coordinator puts great expectations in the ORF &quot; &quot; Help &quot; &quot; as we do . &quot;
&quot; on the platform , individuals can easily offer accommodation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , one hopes for hotels that are empty in winter . &quot;
&quot; yesterday Konrad and Mai@@ er critici@@ zed the standards for accommodation as &quot; &quot; very high . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; in times of emergency , it cannot be that districts have to respect a certain height of the towel holders or the size of the harmon@@ ics . &quot;
&quot; for a temporary period , &quot; &quot; emergency standards &quot; &quot; must apply . &quot;
&quot; in contrast to the Ministry of the Interior , he was more successful when placing an accommodation , Konrad founded with his experience . &quot;
&quot; I am an older gentle@@ man , whom one does not say without further notice of fal@@ seh@@ ood . &quot;
persu@@ asive power is his most important weapon .
Konrad and Mai@@ er do not charge the Republic as they stated .
they want to increase their number of employees from three to four .
his own search was not successful so far .
Konrad wanted to set up a container at the Steph@@ an@@ splatz office as an office .
but there are obviously problems with permission .
Linz calls for a better division
&quot; for the time being , no opening of urban sports halls and other buildings such as tips @-@ arena and design center for housing refugees is planning the city of Linz . &quot;
&quot; this is not necessary at the moment , as the affected parties are currently unable to submit these measures , &quot; says Mayor Klaus Lu@@ ger ( SP ) . &quot;
&quot; for emer@@ gen@@ cies , however , further locations must be checked for their suitability . &quot;
critic@@ ises the city chief in the division of refugees in the federal state .
other districts also have to make their contribution here .
Seeh@@ of@@ er : &quot; borders are not sealed off &quot;
&quot; in a longer telephone conversation with the Bavarian prime minister Horst Seeh@@ of@@ er ( CS@@ U ) , the provincial governor Josef P@@ ühr@@ inger ( VP ) on Monday also acquired the further action in the refugee issue . &quot;
Seeh@@ of@@ er assured me that the German borders were not sealed .
the continuation of refugees to the Federal Republic of Germany is still possible .
&quot; however , there is now the corresponding limit controls . &quot;
&quot; for the time being , there will be no more special features with refugees to Germany . &quot;
&quot; however , the investig@@ ators were brought to Germany with regular trains . &quot;
&quot; from the other EU member states , P@@ ühr@@ inger once again called for increased solidarity in the refugee issue . &quot;
&quot; for P@@ ühr@@ inger , the fact that Austria also carries out controls at its borders is &quot; a logical consequence &quot; of the course of the Germans . &quot;
the next Run@@ t@@ astic is a matter of time
the general remedi@@ ation of the &quot; new shi@@ py@@ ard &quot; in the Linz industrial line is officially finished .
&quot; in four of the six floors of the office and production building , the listed IT Group is moved in , the rest ( 27@@ 00 square meters ) is to be rented to young , innovative companies from the technology sector . &quot;
&quot; the smart minds are our raw material in the IT - and we have to try to work for us , &quot; says S &amp; T CEO Hannes Nieder@@ haus@@ er . &quot;
he could imagine investing in startup companies in the New Wer@@ ft and later also acquire some of them .
&quot; from the very beginning , S &amp; T wants to cooperate with the new neighbours - from which Nieder@@ haus@@ er promises something : &quot; the next Run@@ t@@ astic is just a matter of time . &quot;
&quot; 1.7 million euros were invested by S &amp; T to the location , 3.3 million euros from Tech@@ Center , one @-@ third of the city of Linz , the country of Upper Austria and the Bund ( FF@@ G ) . &quot;
the building is considered by Linz AG for 60 years at S &amp; T as well as Tech@@ Center .
&quot; 30 percent of the 27@@ 00 square metres of remaining space in the building are already rented , for another 40 percent there are requests . &quot;
Li@@ a @-@ Per@@ oni @-@ In@@ gre@@ ess opened second business in the arcade
Fur@@ la hand@@ bags are the focus of the new shop .
Jutta has actually wanted to get a dog .
&quot; this project had to push the 49 @-@ year @-@ old owner of Li@@ a Per@@ oni in the Tau@@ ben@@ markt @-@ Ark@@ ade : after all , she now has grown in the form of another business location . &quot;
&quot; in the Fur@@ la shop , in front of the shop in which they sell bags , suit@@ cases , shoes and clothing from different manufacturers , everything revol@@ ves around ladies hand@@ bags from the brand Fur@@ la , wall@@ ets are from 75 euros . &quot;
larger bags and accessories cost up to 500 euros .
the new shop has been in operation since yesterday .
&quot; previously , several weeks have been re@@ mod@@ elled . &quot;
&quot; but I thought about it for a long time , whether I should open a shop , &quot; &quot; says Br@@ eit . &quot;
&quot; the decision was decisive for the decision , among other things , that the Fur@@ la producers , who are at home in Bologna , were impressed by the idea of a place where only their hand@@ bags were sold . &quot;
&quot; we are the only ones in the Linz wholesale space that sell this brand , &quot; says the mother of two daughters , who has even Italian roots . &quot;
she has brought her fashion interest from her mother to the cra@@ dle .
I am most happy when something develops and I can show new trends at affordable prices .
&quot; why so many women are in rap@@ tures when looking at a hand@@ bag , the expert will not be able to answer with the latest security . &quot;
perhaps it &apos;s due to the fact that a beautiful bag is used for every outfit .
the ro@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher from K@@ all@@ stadt
the Pal@@ at@@ inate ancestors of Donald Tru@@ mp came from a place named An@@ ders .
some people also associate this property with the billi@@ on@@ aire who wants to become US president .
Donald Tru@@ mp ( 69 ) is always good for off@@ setting .
&quot; whether it expresses itself x@@ en@@ opho@@ bic , journalist checks or gaps in knowledge gaps in international crisis policy - the candidate for the US presidential office whi@@ r@@ ls the election campaign power@@ fully . &quot;
and cut off well .
&quot; this is also registered in the Pal@@ at@@ inate K@@ all@@ stadt , where the grand@@ parents of the real estate billi@@ on@@ aire derive from . &quot;
the New Yorker experiences a concept for many in the win@@ eg@@ rowing village on the wine route .
some in the 1200 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village is related over -@@ zig edges with it .
&quot; his grandfather came from K@@ all@@ stadt in the Pal@@ at@@ inate : Donald Tru@@ mp , here in campaign mode . &quot;
the K@@ all@@ städ@@ ter Simone Wen@@ del made a film about Tru@@ mp .
and what do the villa@@ gers think about being the most powerful man in the world ?
&quot; I think they find it exciting , but they are not so deeply impressed in their K@@ all@@ stadt fashion , &quot; says Simone Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; the native city of K@@ all@@ städ@@ t has made an am@@ using documentary about the place and its famous shoots , to which besides Tru@@ mp also the K@@ et@@ ch@@ up family Heinz counts . &quot;
&quot; Tru@@ mp , who is not known for mo@@ dest@@ y , comes in &quot; Kings of K@@ all@@ stadt &quot; ( 2014 ) too - so with the statement that he would certainly be successful if he would live in K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
he has not brought it to the king of the hearts .
&quot; ad@@ mitt@@ edly , there is respect for the performance of the family , but also tend to think that Tru@@ mp is already a bit of a big mouth , &quot; says Wen@@ del . &quot;
&quot; inci@@ dentally , loud the nick@@ name , the K@@ all@@ stadt in the circle , &quot; &quot; Die Br@@ ull@@ j@@ es@@ macher &quot; &quot; - in high German : the gi@@ ver , she says . &quot;
so Tru@@ mp comes from the village of the An@@ ders .
the Tru@@ mp &apos;s success story began in 18@@ 85 when the later grandfather emig@@ rated and opened a restaurant for gold dig@@ gers in the USA .
first real estate purchases in New York were the corner@@ stone of the real estate company .
&quot; but the life of the grand@@ parents was not free of tragedy : their desire to return to their homes , failed in the Bavarian State , to which the Pfalz belonged . &quot;
&quot; he did not record Tru@@ mp because he was once without a permit , the director of the Institute for Pal@@ at@@ inate History and Volk@@ sk@@ unde , Roland Paul , explained to the start of the film . &quot;
Tru@@ mp is the grand@@ son of an &quot; illegal emig@@ rant . &quot;
this contrasts with the sometimes distinctive statements of the descend@@ ant .
he repeatedly talked about Mexican immigrants in the United States and demanded the construction of a border wall to frigh@@ ten illegal immigrants .
&quot; like the one who pol@@ ishes , this is not so li@@ ke@@ able , &quot; says Hans @-@ Joachim Ben@@ der , a distant cous@@ in of Tru@@ mp ( &quot; The Grand@@ ma was a born Tru@@ mp , the grand@@ pa was born Heinz &quot; ) . &quot;
&quot; the win@@ em@@ aker in retirement sees the Americans rather dist@@ anced , &quot; &quot; he is always so br@@ anding . &quot;
does he believe that Tru@@ mp is coming ?
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that , &quot; says the 72 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; he has never taken care of K@@ all@@ stadt . &quot;
&quot; the Pen@@ sion@@ ist Ver@@ oni@@ ka Sch@@ ra@@ mm mentioned like some K@@ all@@ stad@@ ters that a descend@@ ant of the Heinz family donated something for the church organ during a visit , which was generally good . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine that by Donald , &quot; &quot; says the 68 @-@ year @-@ old . &quot;
&quot; it would be better if he did not win the election , because &quot; he has such radical views , I don &apos;t know if that &apos;s good . &quot;
&quot; if those who had the sa@@ wing at the time of his grandfather in the USA would have been like him , &quot; he would never have arrived there . &quot;
&quot; there are more interesting topics than him , &quot; says Win@@ zer@@ to@@ chter Sara Büh@@ ler . &quot;
and as president ?
&quot; my president is not , &quot; she says . &quot;
&quot; and : &quot; &quot; the grapes are ripe also without the president Tru@@ mp . &quot;
&quot; Wend@@ els &apos;s film , inter@@ viewed for the Tru@@ mp for a long time , has seen 12 000 theatrical lea@@ vers , and in the US the interest is w@@ aking up . &quot;
the Upper Bavarian town Ram@@ sau near Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den is Germany &apos;s first mountain clim@@ ber village .
&quot; from the vice @-@ president &apos;s hand at the German Alpine Club , Ludwig Wu@@ cher@@ pf@@ enni@@ g , the 1800 @-@ inhabitants @-@ village in the Ber@@ cht@@ es@@ ga@@ den national park received the award for gentle tourism on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in Austria , there are already 20 &quot; mountain clim@@ bers &quot; villages . &quot;
&quot; in the neighbouring country , the Alpine Club is responsible for awar@@ ding the award . &quot;
&quot; a &quot; &quot; mountain clim@@ ber village &quot; &quot; must have at most 2,500 inhabitants . &quot;
at least one fifth of its surface must be designated as a protected area .
seven &apos;s Sun@@ rise dominates the reviews despite attempts by N@@ ine to take over the loss of leadership at the Today Show
&quot; Karl Stef@@ an@@ ovic and Lisa Wil@@ kin@@ son went to Can@@ ber@@ ra to report to the loss of the Liber@@ als leadership , but there were no great shifts in the Today Reviews . &quot;
the N@@ ine Breakfast Show was broadcast by the federal capital when Mal@@ col@@ m Turn@@ bull created the fall of Tony Ab@@ bot@@ t .
&quot; the rival Sun@@ rise , with the moder@@ ators David Koch and Sam@@ an@@ tha Ar@@ my@@ tage , was part of a week @-@ long series of international television broad@@ casts , including Dubai , New York , Ni@@ ag@@ ara Falls and Can@@ cu@@ n . &quot;
&quot; this disadvantage of the spac@@ ing seemed to play no role for Australian TV viewers , since Sun@@ rise achieved an average of 39@@ 7@@ ,000 spectators at the five main cities , compared to today 33@@ 9@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; today , Today posted a slight increase in ratings for Monday ( 3@@ 17@@ ,000 ) and last Tuesday ( 28@@ 3,000 ) , but its number remained behind last Thursday ( 34@@ 3,000 ) . &quot;
today Today has closed the gap to Sun@@ rise in recent months .
&quot; in August Today , Today , 3@@ 18@@ ,000 reached an average of 3@@ 18@@ ,000 when compared to the 33@@ ,000 Sun@@ rise . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning of the year , the distance between 40,000 and 50,000 passed . &quot;
&quot; up to now , Sun@@ rise has risen to 3@@ 14@@ ,000 viewers at Today in September at an average of 34@@ 9@@ ,000 spectators . &quot;
this is the most interesting thing that happens every morning .
the winds of change affect these morning men more than the parliament !
&quot; Karl and Lisa are fine , thanks for the review ! &quot;

the great news for Seven was the impressive debut of 800 words with the former Seri@@ enst@@ ar from Pack@@ ed to the Raf@@ ters Erik Thom@@ son .
&quot; the new drama about a recently wid@@ owed father , who decided to settle in New Zealand with his two children , reached a very impressive number of 1,@@ 2@@ 19 million viewers . &quot;
critics were asked whether Thom@@ son could carry a hit @-@ show solo without the Raf@@ ters Star Rebecca Gib@@ ney .
&quot; the result of last night responded with a clear &quot; &quot; yes &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the X @-@ Factor of Seven remained strong with 1.@@ 136 million viewers and beat The Block ( 8@@ 3@@ 8.000 ) and T@@ BL Famili@@ es ( 7@@ 26@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
seven had mixed results in the evening two of The Ch@@ ase Australia .
&quot; the first half hour ( 17 : 00 a.m. to 5 : 30 p.m. ) of the new qui@@ z show , hosted by Andrew O &apos;@@ Ke@@ efe scored 44@@ 6,000 spectators . &quot;
&quot; the second half hour ( 17 : 30 to 18 : 00 ) jumped to 6@@ 23@@ ,000 spectators - enough for a little win over Ed@@ die Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Hot @-@ Se@@ at ( 6@@ 13@@ ,000 ) . &quot;
&quot; on Monday evening the first half hour of The Ch@@ ase Australia recorded 5@@ 20,000 spectators and 7@@ 20,000 in the second half hour . &quot;
&quot; hot @-@ Se@@ at on average 6@@ 20,000 . &quot;
the decline in the quot@@ as of the second evening of The Ch@@ ase Australia will make N@@ ine confident that Hot @-@ Se@@ at will ultimately prevail at 5 : 30 p.m .
the Ch@@ ase Australia is a replacement for a million dollar minute that didn &apos;t manage to over@@ haul the Mc@@ Gu@@ ires Show .

the last three agree : Bachelor Sam Wood is the perfect man - but who will he choose ?
mystery revealed ? ...
&quot; L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki may have unknow@@ ingly revealed who wins The Bachelor . &quot;
&quot; the woman , at the end of the bach@@ elor &apos;s degree in The Bachelor , was sh@@ rou@@ ded in the greatest sec@@ rec@@ y . &quot;
and none of the three remaining girls will certainly not reveal whether they are the one who received the last rose .
&quot; but when we checked with Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay , S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana Mark@@ os@@ ki and L@@ ana Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows on the day before going out of three two , you may have acci@@ dentally given a clu@@ e to who will be the winner . &quot;
Sam Wood keeps his lips sealed until the final on Thursday
&quot; all three women found themselves ly@@ rical about why Wood is the perfect man and named his sense of humour , ambition , family values and positive attitude as reasons why they like to be his partner . &quot;
&quot; however , if the question is asked &quot; If not you , who should receive W@@ oods last rose ? &quot; could their answers to the game cor@@ rup@@ ting who won the heart of the Bach@@ el@@ ors . &quot;
Je@@ av@@ ons Fel@@ lows and Mark@@ os@@ ki named both fast - apart from themselves - M@@ ack@@ ay as the best partner for Wood .
&quot; from the first day , Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay and Sam Wood have had a simple relationship with each other . &quot;
&quot; from the moment I went into the house and noticed ( Sarah &apos;s ) and S@@ ams energies , I felt they were quite compatible and I thought it all over the show , &quot; &quot; said Je@@ av@@ on Fel@@ lows . &quot;
&quot; Sarah is standing on the ground with both feet , it &apos;s so much fun to be with her , &quot; Mark@@ os@@ ki added . &quot;
I have seen them together and they have the right chemistry .
they feel comfortable and comfortable with each other .
Sarah M@@ ack@@ ay believes that she and Sam Wood are well suited as a couple .
&quot; from her point of view , M@@ ack@@ ay said that the visit to the house made her clear last week that Wood &quot; &quot; One &quot; &quot; could be . &quot;
&quot; as soon as I saw him with my friends and family , it became clear to me that this is obviously not just a game - I am now un@@ condition@@ ally att@@ un@@ ed to him , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; and when she was asked who Wood should choose , if not she , she was pu@@ zz@@ ling . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t know if I can say that , &quot; she said . &quot;
I love the remaining girls equally - it &apos;s a draw between S@@ ne@@ z@@ ana and L@@ ana .
&quot; the Bachelor is broadcast on Wednesday , 7 : 30@@ pm . &quot;
originally released as Sarah &apos;s first choice for Sam Wood ?
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne had several options to start his N@@ FL career .
Detroit and Seattle showed great interest after moving to the USA - and there were many other teams that sent requests after his impressive open training day at the end of last year .
but Hay@@ ne chose the San Francisco 49@@ ers and coach Jim Tom@@ sul@@ a and it looks like a wise decision .
some trainers would have ban@@ ished Hay@@ ne for the rest of the game to the bank when he lost a don@@ gle as the Aus@@ sie @-@ Ru@@ g@@ by League Con@@ vert hit his first Pun@@ t @-@ Return on Tuesday at the 20 @-@ 3 victory against Minn@@ es@@ ota .
but Tom@@ sul@@ a trusted his husband and gave Hay@@ ne the next opportunity to return to a pun@@ t @-@ return and also to the ongoing game after a violation of Reg@@ gie Bush .
Tom@@ sul@@ a continued to show his true face in the locker room after the game .
&quot; instead of grinding his ro@@ ok@@ ies before the rest of the team through the mill , he encouraged them . &quot;
Tom@@ sul@@ a also publicly confirmed Hay@@ ne in his press conference after the game .
&quot; the 49@@ ers sports journalist Cam In@@ man reported that Hay@@ ne was also encouraged by special team coordinator , Thomas Mc@@ Gau@@ gh@@ ey , who advised him to forget his missed catch and take care of the next game . &quot;
Jar@@ ry@@ d Hay@@ ne p@@ atz@@ t at a pun@@ t restored in the first quarter of the Minn@@ es@@ ota Vi@@ kings
it was certainly not the start that Hay@@ ne and his massive Australian band had hoped for his N@@ FL debut .
Hay@@ ne left the playing field after the F@@ um@@ ble and later told the Australian radio duo Ham@@ ish &amp; Andy on 2@@ Day@@ FM 10@@ 4.1 that he couldn &apos;t imagine a worse start into his N@@ FL career .
&quot; this was a thing that happens now , you just take care of the next game , and that &apos;s it , &quot; &quot; said Hay@@ ne . &quot;
Hay@@ ne compared the car@@ ver with his original debut back then in 2007 when a passport with his own in @-@ Go@@ al area led to a T@@ ry for Que@@ ens@@ land .
all in all it was a great experience for the 27 @-@ year @-@ old .
Hay@@ ne posed for a photo with fans and held an Australian flag after the game and posted it on his Inst@@ agra@@ m .
El@@ ton John and Russian President Vladimir Putin met to discuss gay rights

the Free voters call for the hi@@ ring of 1000 new teachers in Bavaria for the high refugee numbers .
&quot; at the start of the F@@ W autumn break in Groß@@ wall@@ stadt , party and group leader Hubert Ai@@ wan@@ ger warned of a serious crisis in Bavaria &apos;s schools , if there were no new teachers for the many new students : &quot; &quot; we need at least 1000 additional teachers to protect the schools from collapse , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , we will get inv@@ oc@@ ations in the Bavarian education system . &quot;
the Free @-@ Free State Parliament will be conven@@ ed until Friday in the Fran@@ con@@ ian Commune .
&quot; in fact , quite different main themes were planned . &quot;
but the record number of refugees now also dominates the Free voters &apos; meeting .
&quot; of course , the subject of asylum will over@@ lap the clo@@ ister , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
&quot; Ai@@ wan@@ ger called for the establishment of UN protection zones for refugees in Syria , just as there were during the Yugoslavia wars in the 1990s . &quot;
&quot; this is not the case , we have to look at the causes , &quot; said the Free @-@ elec@@ tor chief . &quot;
rejected asylum seekers want to de@@ fer the Free voters as soon as possible .
&quot; therefore , Ai@@ wan@@ ger also demanded more staff for the administration courts in charge of asylum claims : &quot; &quot; we also need at least 50 new asylum seekers , &quot; &quot; said Ai@@ wan@@ ger . &quot;
the F@@ W Chief critic@@ ised the fact that several federal states were not consistent : &quot; we need standardised standards of federal states across Germany . &quot;
&quot; Bavaria sli@@ ps away , others don &apos;t . &quot;
&quot; we have to become more able to act . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; however , the state policy in Great Britain should not fall under the table . &quot;
a long @-@ standing torch remains on the agenda : the education policy .
&quot; for the new school year , cult Minister Ludwig Spa@@ en@@ le ( CS@@ U ) started the pilot study &quot; &quot; middle level plus &quot; &quot; at 47 grammar schools in which an extension of the secondary intermediate level will be tested from three to four years . &quot;
but Ai@@ wan@@ ger doesn &apos;t go far enough .
&quot; the issue of G@@ 9 must be accelerated , &quot; said the F@@ W chief . &quot;
we demand freedom of choice for all gymn@@ asi@@ ums who want it .
free travel at the G@@ 9 wherever it is desired .
stronger Wall Street helps D@@ ax jump on the jumps
&quot; following an over @-@ long distances , the German stock market has closed out@@ going and nervous trading history with profits . &quot;
&quot; only in the afternoon was a definite pr@@ elu@@ de to the US stock markets for a clear direction , which ultimately promoted the D@@ ax by 0.@@ 56 percent to 10@@ 18@@ 8.@@ 13 points upwards . &quot;
the M@@ DA@@ X medium @-@ sized value gained 0.@@ 54 percent to 19 5@@ 2.@@ 88 points .
the technology @-@ resili@@ ent Tec@@ D@@ ax climbed by 1.@@ 03 percent to 17@@ 3@@ 6.@@ 69 points .
&quot; Euro Sto@@ xx 50 , as the benchmark for the euro zone , fell by 1.@@ 01 percent to 3@@ 20@@ 7.@@ 60 points . &quot;
solid profits also booked commercial venues in London and Paris .
&quot; in the US , the Dow Jones index recently noted around 1 percent in the Plus . &quot;
many Bör@@ z@@ aner anticipate that the markets will be in place until after the interest decision in the US and also for the big event on the stock exchanges on this Friday .
the debate about the loads from the nuclear phase has meanwhile pushed the RW@@ E shares to a record low and left deep marks on E@@ on .
&quot; according to &quot; Spiegel , &quot; the German energy companies possibly lack 30 billion euros of provisions . &quot;
* Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop .
&quot; as a result , the shares of the two largest German energy companies recovered slightly , but ultimately lost 3.@@ 31 percent ( RW@@ E ) and 6.@@ 15 percent ( E@@ on ) . &quot;
Infin@@ eon shares increased by a further 3.@@ 22 percent on the D@@ ax summit .
&quot; according to a tra@@ der , a positive report from the US start @-@ up magazine &quot; Bar@@ ron &apos;s &quot; appeared from the weekend . &quot;
&quot; accordingly , investors gave too little attention to the German chip@@ maker . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , investment in promising w@@ afer technologies and the focus on the automotive market should be paid out . &quot;
&quot; car values were required : even in the traditionally weak summer months of August , more cars were released than in the previous year , as the Industry Association AC@@ EA announced at the start of the International Motor Show IAA in Frankfurt . &quot;
the papers issued by the Daimler and BMW motor@@ cyclists increased by 1.@@ 34 percent and 2.@@ 21 percent respectively .
Volkswagen assets increased by 1.@@ 26 percent .
on the German pension market the return on stock of listed federal securities amounted to 0.@@ 48 ( Friday : 0.@@ 50 ) percent .
the Re@@ x pension index increased by 0.@@ 12 percent to 13@@ 9.@@ 55 points .
the federal future lost 0.@@ 71 percent to 15@@ 4.@@ 11 points .
the euro &apos;s course sank in the afternoon to € 1.@@ 12@@ 62 .
&quot; towards mid@@ day , the European Central Bank had set the reference rate to 1,@@ 13@@ 05 ( 1,@@ 12@@ 68 ) US dollars . &quot;
the dollar thus cost 0.@@ 88@@ 46 ( 0.@@ 88@@ 75 ) euros .
4 People killed after polic@@ emen shot rubber bul@@ lets on prot@@ esters in Nepal
&quot; four people , including a 4 @-@ year @-@ old boy , were killed in Southern Nepal after the police shot rubber bul@@ lets in a crowd that demonstrated against the proposed new constitution , a civil servant said on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; violence broke out on Tuesday evening in the Rup@@ el@@ ong@@ i district , approximately 175 miles west of the capital Kathmandu . &quot;
&quot; B@@ ish@@ nu Pr@@ as@@ ad D@@ ha@@ kal , head of the district official , said that more than 1,000 demonstr@@ ators had gathered outside a police station , and some of them threw stones and fire bombs . &quot;
Mr D@@ ha@@ kal said the police used tear gas and then shot in the air before rub@@ bing on rubber floors .
&quot; 20 polic@@ emen and five civilians were injured , he said . &quot;
&quot; it was not immediately clear why the rubber floors used are known to be able to kill , but traditionally used as a less deadly alternative , apparently such a high death rate . &quot;
&quot; the confrontation was the last in weeks of violent protests in Nepal &apos;s southern plains , where members of the ethnic group of the Mad@@ hes@@ i say that new provinces , formed within the framework of the proposed new constitution , would reduce its political influence . &quot;
there have also been protests in western Nepal from the ethnic group of the Th@@ arus that want to have their own state .
&quot; at least 40 people , including 11 police officers , have been involved in violent clas@@ hes since the 10th century . &quot;
&quot; killed when the four major political parties signed an agreement to divide the country into provinces - an important step towards a new constitution , but a very controversial topic in Nepal , which has been centrally governed for centuries . &quot;
&quot; the work on a new constitution has been on its way since 2008 , but the legislature ha@@ sten@@ ed the process after the devastating earthquake that killed thousands of people in April . &quot;
&quot; the legisl@@ ator voted this week on certain cl@@ auses in the constitutional design in Kathmandu , and officials said that the new constitution could come into force on Sunday . &quot;
construction site planned in the city
the property at Em@@ den Youth Centre Alte Post is to be rebuilt .
the city is currently preparing everything for the marketing of the 4000 square meter area .
&quot; a mix of trade , commerce and housing is planned - but there are no specific offers yet . &quot;
Em@@ den - The city of Em@@ den wants to promote an approximately 4000 square meter plot in direct neighbourhood to the Youth Centre Alte Post .
preparations for this are currently underway .
&quot; it is planned to use the terrain for a mix of trade , commerce and housing . &quot;
&quot; one is waiting for corresponding offers , it is called by the city . &quot;
which investor is coming to question is not yet clear .
&quot; accordingly , no contracts had been concluded . &quot;
&quot; the city of Em@@ den had a part of the property , which is located at the Ring@@ straße / corner of the Great Street , already bought some months ago and the building that was located . &quot;
project H@@ ieve : details are on the table
the planning of the holiday settlement at the Small Sea near Em@@ den take shape .
the investor first made public plans for the project .
several An@@ li@@ eger are further worried - they fear selling their leisure time
&quot; months had been negotiated , gri@@ eved , deb@@ ated and drawn behind closed doors . &quot;
now there are plans for a new holiday settlement on the Small Sea near Em@@ den on the table .
&quot; the Inter@@ esting , the medium @-@ sized Em@@ den Company &quot; System Construction , &quot; presented its plans for the first time on Monday evening in the City Development Committee of the Em@@ den Council . &quot;
&quot; originally , this point had been on the non @-@ public part of the agenda . &quot;
&quot; under pressure from the project critic and the F@@ DP Group accused of investors and managing sec@@ rec@@ y , Ralf Be@@ hr@@ weiler headed the system construction management to the offensive : &quot; we have not yet responded to all questions , &quot; he said to the members of the Council and more than 50 visitors . &quot;
but it is good to be able to meet all rum@@ ors now .
&quot; for months , the project has been taking place in the discussion about ten to twelve million euros . &quot;
&quot; hef@@ ty reactions among the owners of the sea , who came to the meeting , summ@@ ed up the pictures and new details of the desired hotel building . &quot;
&quot; Roberto Schulz , owner of the Meer@@ bus@@ de and board member in the interests of the An@@ li@@ eger , Pro H@@ ieve , compla@@ ins : &quot; &quot; this will be a big kl@@ ot@@ z that dominates all the other buildings . &quot;
&quot; he also fears like a number of other project critics that traffic is increasing due to the intended size of the plant : &quot; &quot; entire bus loads must come in order for that to be calculated , &quot; &quot; said Schulz &quot;
&quot; what is happening in the area of the former restaurant , which is exactly one hect@@ are area , is still open . &quot;
there is no operator yet .
&quot; first we have to have a coherent concept , &quot; &quot; said Ralf Be@@ hr@@ mann . &quot;
&quot; because this was still missing , the development plans are still variable . &quot;

Google launches dou@@ bling donations campaign to collect 11 million dollars for refugees
&quot; Google Inc . ( Goo@@ db@@ . O ) announced a campaign of dou@@ bling of $ 11 million for humanitarian organizations to help thousands of refugees who over@@ run the European Nations , as they flee from the war torn and im@@ pover@@ ished countries . &quot;
Google has an un@@ usually personal approach to publi@@ ci@@ zing the Don@@ ation call on his blog .
&quot; instead of letting a manager make the announcement , Rita Mas@@ oud , a Google employee who fled with her family from Kab@@ ul , when she was seven years old , wrote about her personal experiences . &quot;
&quot; our trip included many dark railroad and bus rides , as well as hunger , thirst , cold and fear , &quot; she wrote . &quot;
I was lucky .
&quot; but as the refugee and migrants crisis has grown in Europe , many people like my family are desper@@ ately looking for help . &quot;
&quot; donations go to four charitable organisations providing assistance to refugees and migrants : doctors With@@ out Bor@@ ders , International Res@@ cue Committee , Save the Children and UN High Commissioner for Refu@@ ge@@ es . &quot;
Google said that the first global funds raised up to a value of 5.5 million are doubled to $ 11 million on goo@@ gle@@ .com .
&quot; Europe is confronted with its worst refugee crisis since World War II , largely caused by the four @-@ year civil war in Syria , which has driven more than 4 million people this year . &quot;
&quot; many fled from the war torn by war , Yemen , Iraq and Libya . &quot;

weight loss surgery may be helpful for easily obes@@ e diabe@@ tics .
the benefits of weight loss surgery for easily overweight people with type 2 diabetes can last at least five years after a new study .
it &apos;s still too early to tell if slightly overweight people with diabetes after weight loss surgery live longer than those who receive non @-@ surgical treatments .
&quot; the mortality data need a long time to show something , &quot; said Dr. Robin Black@@ stone , an expert in weight loss surgery , who wrote an editorial to the new study in J@@ AM@@ A Sur@@ gery . &quot;
&quot; weight loss surgery or Adi@@ posit@@ as surgery , use different methods to reduce the size of the stomach . &quot;
they reduce hunger and limit the body &apos;s ability to absorb food .
&quot; over the years , obesity has proven to be efficient to treat type 2 diabetes , but most studies have been performed in people who are obes@@ e with a body mass index ( BM@@ I ) of 35 or higher . &quot;
&quot; BM@@ I , a measure of weight in relation to size , is considered normal between 18.@@ 5 and 24.@@ 9 . &quot;
a BM@@ I of 25 or more indicates that someone is overweight and people with a BM@@ I over 30 are considered obes@@ e .
you can calculate your BM@@ I here : 1.@@ us@@ a.@@ go@@ v / 1@@ D@@ 0@@ Z@@ q@@ D@@ v .
&quot; for the new study , the researchers from Taiwan &apos;s Min @-@ Sh@@ eng General Hospital used data that they have collected in a study since 2007 and compare two types of obesity surgery - ga@@ stri@@ c b@@ ypass and ga@@ stri@@ c acid formation - for medical treatments for type 2 diabetes in people who were slightly overweight . &quot;
the average BM@@ I among those who underwent this operation decreased from 31 to 24.@@ 5 to the end of the fifth year in this study .
&quot; meanwhile , the BM@@ I remained among those who received non @-@ surgical diabetes treatments approximately at 29 . &quot;
&quot; among those who underwent surgical procedure , 36 % dis@@ b@@ anded the diabetes illness and , at 28 % , in part . &quot;
&quot; in the medical @-@ treated group , diabetes was completely dissolved only at one percent and partially at only about two percent . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the results were better in the controls of blood pressure , tri@@ gly@@ c@@ eri@@ des and &quot; bad &quot; LD@@ L cholesterol &quot; generally better in the &apos; surgical &apos; group , the authors found out . &quot;
&quot; the researchers also monitored ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c blood levels , reflecting the blood sugar levels over time . &quot;
&quot; ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c is best kept under 7 percent , write the researchers . &quot;
&quot; after surgery , the average hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in decreased by around 9 percent to around 6 percent . &quot;
&quot; in the medical therapy group , however , it remained stable at about 8 percent . &quot;
&quot; but this better &quot; gly@@ ca@@ em@@ ic control &quot; - as reflected in the improved hem@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c level - did not dimin@@ ish mortality in five years , so the senior researcher Dr. Chi@@ h @-@ Ch@@ eng H@@ su and his colleagues . &quot;
the research team also compared average results in the two types of surgery .
&quot; in the fifth year , the b@@ ypass surgery group had lost more weight compared with the Gast@@ rec@@ tomy Group ( 18.@@ 7 vs. 14.@@ 2 kg ) , reached higher returns in BM@@ I ( 7.@@ 4 vs 5.1 ) and ha@@ em@@ o@@ glob@@ in A@@ 1@@ c ( 3.1 % vs. 2.1 % ) and reported a complete overcoming of diabetes ( 4@@ 6.@@ 9 % vs. 16.@@ 7 % ) . &quot;
&quot; while the new study does not show survival benefit of surgery after five years , there are evidence from a study of more serious people in Sweden that operation leads to a longer life , says Black@@ stone from the University of Arizona , College of Medicine Phoenix . &quot;
&quot; in the Swedish study , it was with obes@@ e people who underwent obesity surgery , about 29 percent less likely to die in the course of 15 years - compared to a group that tried conventional methods . &quot;
&quot; although the new study showed no benefit to survival in surgery patients , Black@@ stone said it was soothing for individuals with a BM@@ I of 35 who are interested in the procedure . &quot;
&quot; this is the critical point of this study , because it says that this operation is lower in this lower BM@@ I group , &quot; without increased risk of death or kidney disease , she said . &quot;
Black@@ stone added that people and their doctors should start taking weight seriously once the patient with his BM@@ I lies between 27 and 30 .
&quot; I think we are waiting for too long , until we get people to take this seriously , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; I think once they have accumulated these genetic changes that have firmly joined their bodies with obesity and diabetes , a revers@@ al is really difficult . &quot;
love story plays in the H@@ uns@@ rück
&quot; it is a topic that is increasingly observ@@ able in fiction : a young woman , un@@ popular and un@@ si@@ gh@@ tly at school times , meets the s@@ warm of her youth after years , and this falls in love with her . &quot;
&quot; even in the recently published novel &quot; Ac@@ tu@@ ally , we are not so &quot; by Lu@@ isa Bin@@ der . &quot;
&quot; beyond the love story , the novel is especially interesting for H@@ uns@@ rück readers , because he plays in Lang@@ weiler and the surrounding villages . &quot;
the main @-@ time writer has grown up in Lang@@ weiler and is happy that she could set up a literary monument to her hom@@ etown .
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe &quot; - Dalai Lama - RT @-@ News
&quot; Europe cannot accept all the refugees , said the Dalai Lama and added that the real solution to the refugee crisis in the Middle East was lying . &quot;
the Tibetan Buddhist guide called for an end to violence in the home countries of the refugees .
the Dalai Lama spoke about the problem of the ongoing refugee crisis at the beginning of his ten @-@ day visit to the UK in his speech on the opening of the Dalai Lama Centre for Com@@ passion in Oxford devoted to ethics studies .
he demanded that under the given circumstances the interests of humanity should be placed before the interests of the individual nations or even continents .
&quot; he also stressed that the response of Western European countries to the refugee crisis is ad@@ mira@@ ble , but the situation is not appropriate . &quot;
&quot; it is impossible that everyone can come to Europe , &quot; &quot; he said in his speech . &quot;
&quot; although the Dalai Lama was Germany &apos;s and Austria &apos;s efforts to tackle the crisis , he stressed that it was only a temporary solution . &quot;
&quot; to take care of several thousand refugees is wonderful , but in the meantime , you need to think about long @-@ term solutions , such as a real peace and genuine development , mainly through education , for these Muslim countries , &quot; &quot; he stressed . &quot;
&quot; ultimately , we need to think about how the killing will be reduced in their countries . &quot;
we must reduce the use of force .
&quot; the use of force has never solved these problems , &quot; he added . &quot;
the Dalai Lama promised the problem of violence and also commented George Bush &apos;s action after the terrorist attack on 11 September and turned out that the violent reaction of the US pulled out a chain of un@@ controll@@ able events .
&quot; after September 11 , I expressed my sympathy in a letter to President Bush , and I told him the way to solve this problem lies in non@@ violence . &quot;
&quot; I know his motives were good , but he got violence and this caused unexpected consequences , &quot; &quot; said the Dalai Lama . &quot;
four @-@ fold increase of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant inf@@ ect@@ ants by children in the past 4 years
&quot; poison control centers in the United States report about an almost 400 percent increase in the number of children under the age of twelve , which swal@@ lowed strongly alcoholic hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants , such as the Georgia Po@@ ison Center . &quot;
&quot; according to Dr. Ga@@ yl@@ ord Lop@@ ez , Director of Georgia Po@@ ison Center , cases of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants in children under the age of 12 have increased from 3,@@ 26@@ 6 in 2010 to 16,@@ 117 in 2014 . &quot;
&quot; children are increasingly coming to these products , and unfortunately a percentage of them land in the emergency room , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez CN@@ N . &quot;
he said that some children can deliberately drink dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants while some do it to impress their friends or because of a mut@@ ation among the social media .
YouTube videos show how te@@ ens dis@@ inf@@ ect dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants only because of a cheap experience .
teenagers allegedly have mixed dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants with soft mou@@ th@@ wash to obtain a harder beverage .
younger children can be attracted by attractive sc@@ ents of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants .
&quot; a child does not think this is bad for it , &quot; &quot; said Lop@@ ez . &quot;
many of the most attractive ( hand dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants ) are those that are perf@@ um@@ ed .
&quot; there is dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant with straw@@ berry , grapes and orange scent that are very appealing for children . &quot;
dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants contain anywhere between 45 and 95 percent alcohol .
&quot; especially for small children , very few spra@@ yers can lead to alcohol intoxic@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; it is highly concentrated alcohol , &quot; said Dr. Stephen Th@@ orn@@ ton , medical director of the poison emergency centre at the Hospital of the University of K@@ ans@@ as , the transmitter Fox 4 in kan@@ sa City . &quot;
&quot; so , you wouldn &apos;t let si@@ p whis@@ ky around , but people leave this hand @-@ dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ant within reach of children , and when children come to it then it &apos;s a quick way to consume lots of alcohol . &quot;
&quot; N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah Rus@@ sell , a six @-@ year @-@ old girl , who had recently taken four squ@@ ash of straw@@ berry sc@@ aff@@ i@@ ding agents at school , was brought to the clinic in an emergency room . &quot;
&quot; her blood alcohol concentration was 17@@ 9 , twice higher than the threshold that is legally as drunk in an adult , said Dr. Chris Rit@@ ch@@ ey , an emergency physician who treated her at the G@@ winn@@ ett Medical Center outside Atlanta . &quot;
N@@ ha@@ i@@ jah all@@ u@@ ded her words and was unable to go when she arrived in the emergency room .
&quot; doctors over@@ saw her overnight in a separate children &apos;s hospital for signs of brain trauma , as the girl fell through the alcohol and had hit her head , said Rit@@ ch@@ ey . &quot;
&quot; that was very frigh@@ tening , &quot; &quot; said Or@@ atory a Scott , N@@ ha@@ i@@ j@@ ah &apos;s mother , CN@@ N . &quot;
it could have been fatal for my child .
Lop@@ ez has recommended parents and teachers to use soft products or dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and store dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants outside the reach of the child .
&quot; beyond alcohol intoxic@@ ation , some dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants were associated with deaths . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , two women in Ontario died after the swal@@ lowing of dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants which contained a toxic , non @-@ declared ingredient . &quot;
&quot; health authorities suspect that the product contained meth@@ anol , a deadly solution instead of eth@@ yl alcohol , which was noted as active ingredient . &quot;
&quot; in January , three students of the fourth class in the State of New York planned to poison their &quot; common &quot; teacher by putting anti @-@ bacterial products around the classroom , &quot; reports a police report . &quot;
the teacher is highly allergic to dis@@ inf@@ ect@@ ants and ban@@ ishes them out of their room .
&quot; the police viewed the sworn plan as &quot; &quot; j@@ ig@@ saw &quot; &quot; and rejected disciplinary measures to the school authorities . &quot;
Vil@@ lingen @-@ Schwen@@ n@@ ingen : three vehicles damaged

a 60 @-@ year @-@ old truck driver drove towards the roundabout in the direction of the roundabout and realised too late that two driving cars had stopped at the roundabout .
&quot; as a result , he crashed into the rear of an audi@@ tor with his truck and pushed this car to a stand@@ still Ford Fi@@ esta . &quot;
&quot; damage to the vehicles involved was about 10,000 euros , the police reported . &quot;
the 33 @-@ year @-@ old Audi was no longer available and had to be tow@@ ed .

Griff@@ i@@ ths plays talk about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y
&quot; there are rum@@ ors about di@@ shar@@ mon@@ y at Celtic Glasgow , which was rejected by Griff@@ i@@ ths . he insi@@ sted that he and his team mates were not under increased control , as they prepare for confrontation with the Dutch leader . &quot;
&quot; I don &apos;t think we feel under pressure , I think the players are looking forward to it . &quot;
the lack of title competition in Scottish football dri@@ es Dutch - de Bo@@ er
&quot; the former R@@ angers middle @-@ field player and former national player of the Netherlands Ron@@ ald de Bo@@ er said that Dutch football fans lost interest in Celtic , there &apos;s no title rival@@ ry with the R@@ angers . &quot;
&quot; Bo@@ er , currently an ambassador for Aj@@ ax , said : &quot; &quot; in Holland , they show no high@@ points of Celtic games more and why ? &quot;
it is because the R@@ angers are not there .
people here talk not only about the return of the R@@ angers .
you speak about the Old Firm .
they talk about both teams and that is what they are interested in .
&quot; there &apos;s a lot of excitement in the Old @-@ Firm @-@ Games , and it &apos;s not only the people in Scotland who want to see these games . &quot;
&quot; I will turn things around , swe@@ ars Dei@@ la . &quot;
&quot; Ron@@ ny Dei@@ la has accepted that Celtic fought , but the Norwegian boss s@@ wore to turn things around . &quot;
&quot; following the defeat against Malm@@ ö and the subsequent withdrawal from the Champions League , the defeat against ten men from Aber@@ deen , which now with five points lead clearly at the top of the table . &quot;
&quot; but Dei@@ la said , &quot; &quot; Celtic had bad times before , and we will come back . &quot;
now we want to come out as soon as possible .
&quot; I know it &apos;s very frustr@@ ating and a lot of people are very , very angry or sad about what happens . &quot;
we feel it exactly this way - but we must go on .
&quot; we really need the support from Celtic , because that makes the players better . &quot;
standing together is so important .
War@@ bur@@ ton cau@@ ti@@ ously at January @-@ transfers
&quot; despite his comments only a couple of weeks ago , indicating that he was picking up some January transfers , R@@ angers @-@ boss Mark War@@ bur@@ ton is cau@@ tious when signing new entran@@ ces and insi@@ sts that he does not want to distur@@ b the unity of the I@@ bro@@ x cad@@ res . &quot;
the ex @-@ chief of Br@@ ent@@ ford said : &quot; the January transfer window is very different from the summer window . &quot;
players coming in the summer have this pre @-@ season time to integrate what you have seen with our own group this season .
the team is really good .
sometimes more damage is done by adding unnecessary players to what you really need .

&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es is glad to win against Hamilton , &quot; un@@ attractive . &quot; &quot;
Der@@ ek Mc@@ Inn@@ es ad@@ mits that his team of Aber@@ deen had to fight desper@@ ately against Hamilton Ac@@ cies to win a seventh consecutive league victory that brought them a lead of five points ahead of Celtic at the top of the table thanks to Adam Ro@@ one@@ ys El@@ f@@ meter in the first half @-@ time .
&quot; Mc@@ Inn@@ es said : &quot; &quot; there is no team that has won everything , in tro@@ phy games or li@@ lies , which have not won games of this kind either . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remains unchanged , while in the UK it is rising . &quot;
&quot; unemployment in Scotland remained unchanged at 16@@ 4,000 in the period May to July , while the number of people without work for the United Kingdom rose by 10,000 to 1.@@ 82 million in the same period . &quot;
&quot; Scotland &apos;s unemployment rate of 5.@@ 9 percent was above the 5.5 percent of the U@@ K@@ s , as shown by the numbers of the National Statisti@@ cal Bureau ( ON@@ S ) . &quot;
&quot; in the meantime , employment in Scotland fell by 12@@ ,000 during the three months , with the number of employees now at 2,@@ 6@@ 12@@ ,000 . &quot;
&quot; in the course of the quarter , the employment rate for Scotland fell to 7@@ 4.0 percent - a figure above the UK average of 7@@ 3.5 percent . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary of State for Scotland David Mund@@ ell commented on the latest figures and said : &quot; &quot; the long @-@ term plan of the government has laid the foundation for a stronger economy . &quot;
it is almost exactly a year ago that Scotland has taken the historic decision to remain part of the United Kingdom .
&quot; &quot; &quot; in these 12 months we have experienced further improvements in the Scottish labour market with an increase in employment and a decline in unemployment . &quot;

why I witness an execution in Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a
&quot; a little later today , except for a late legal intervention , I will see how a man is brought to death . &quot;
&quot; if it happens and I hope that it does not happen , I will sit in a spect@@ ator gallery in the death chamber at the Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a State Pen@@ it@@ enti@@ ary when Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is executed by the poison sy@@ ringe . &quot;
he asked me to be one of the four official witnesses at his death .
&quot; the invitation came for the first time in January about his best friend , and although I was shocked , I agreed . &quot;
&quot; when the day drew closer , I began to fear . &quot;
so why should I do it ?
&quot; I agreed , because I thought it would be a good way to tell the whole story about the death penalty . &quot;
it would offer a unique perspective .
&quot; it is true that journalists are allowed to see directions in the United States , and there are often more applications available than places to decide who is elected . &quot;
Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a has reduced the number of media sites from 12 to five .
&quot; who will be selected , will observe it emotion@@ ally . &quot;
I cannot do that .
I will sit next to Richard Glos@@ si@@ ps close friend with whom I have developed my own relationship over the months with telephone calls and a two and a half hours visit .
I like the guy .
we often laugh a lot when we speak .
&quot; the prison authorities say that I cannot be a witness and a journalist , so I will not be allowed to take a not@@ ebook and a pen to record what I see . &quot;
I just have to try to remind me of all the details .
a journalist from Ok@@ la@@ hom@@ a accused me of giving up my im@@ parti@@ ality on Twitter .
here is the lesson .
tell the story of the prisoner how he wants it and you get access .
I compla@@ ined to her .
&quot; she admitted that she &quot; could have formulated it better , &quot; but she still thinks it &apos;s wrong what I &apos;m doing . &quot;
Richard Glos@@ si@@ p had a problem with some of the things I said and written .
&quot; he doesn &apos;t tell me what I have to write , and I wouldn &apos;t do it even if he would do it . &quot;
I told him that he can remove me from his list of witnesses at any time .
but he wants an international re@@ porter to be present to write there .
&quot; when he dies , he thinks that the public relations of the movement will help the death penalty . &quot;
&quot; Kim Bell@@ ware , a re@@ porter from the Hu@@ ff@@ ington Post , will sit next to me . &quot;
&quot; if you want to know more about the case , please listen to the series of pod@@ casts that I made . &quot;
I don &apos;t want to go back to all the details .
I can &apos;t say with certainty that Richard Glos@@ si@@ p is innocent .
his actions after the murder of Barry Van Tre@@ ese would make him guilty of being a bene@@ fici@@ ary of the deed .
but I believe that there is a strong chance that he is not guilty of murder .
I believe there is not enough evidence to justify a death sentence .
I believe that his execution is false .
and from this perspective I will see him die .
I cannot claim to be really objective .
there will be other re@@ porters to whom you can contact .
what you will get from me is what it means to see a man die a unnecessary death .

&quot; a man &apos;s attempt to hang out the police was un@@ successful when he was in the shallow and sw@@ amp@@ y water , just a few meters from a police officer who tried to persu@@ ade him to return to the shore . &quot;
cann@@ ing V@@ ale police was called in Beck@@ en@@ ham on Tuesday .
&quot; when they discovered the suspect , he tried to escape them in the direction of Cann@@ ing River . &quot;
but he did not come too far .
&quot; he stood in water and said , &quot; &quot; I don &apos;t come out , come and get me , &quot; &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant S@@ hand@@ ell Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
&quot; stable Lach@@ lan Per@@ ha@@ ve@@ c was not too enthusiastic about making his uniform wet , so he turned a more reliable tac@@ tic - &quot; A good polic@@ eman deals . &quot; &quot;
&quot; sometimes people do funny things to try to escape , &quot; said senior Serge@@ ant Cast@@ led@@ ine . &quot;
championship football player Ben C@@ ous@@ ins offers an unforgettable example .
&quot; in 2006 , cous@@ in drove his car to the dit@@ ch to avoid alcohol control and then tried to swim over the S@@ wan River . &quot;
his efforts were un@@ successful but inspired locals to the humor@@ ous planning of a Ben C@@ ous@@ in @-@ Bi@@ athlon .
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that Ste@@ wards tried to spy on him and threat@@ ens to end racing sports
Peter M@@ oo@@ dy claims that ste@@ wards of Racing Victoria tried to install a spy in his st@@ ables last year and threatened to finish the race immediately .
&quot; he pointed to the Ste@@ wards and the integrity section of Racing Victoria and claimed that they conducted a personal campaign against him with the L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching of Lady Tat@@ ai because of a race day treatment , the last straw on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy said Fair@@ fax Media that he always tried to do what is best for racing and he found himself under difficult conditions , when it was about the positive cob@@ alt t@@ amp@@ utation at Li@@ dar@@ is , which he cannot explain . &quot;
he held back 18 months because of the es@@ pi@@ onage charges and did not want it to &quot; look like too high @-@ hanging grapes . &quot;
&quot; I had nothing to say about it and I sat on it for a long time , but sometimes you are so frustr@@ ated that everything comes out at once , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
they know that it went on .
&quot; sometimes you react , and you have to live with the consequences , and I have to live with what I said . &quot;
I will go home tonight and sleep well .
&quot; I &apos;d like to walk around my head , and I want my owners to think that I try my best for them . &quot;
&quot; when they start thinking , I don &apos;t do that , then I should not be more trainer . &quot;
I have to think about what I am doing with my license .
&quot; previously , M@@ oo@@ dy had let the bomb rise in an interview with rac@@ ing@@ .com that the integrity department had tried to spy out his stable . &quot;
&quot; eigh@@ teen months ago Ter@@ ry Bail@@ ey , Da@@ yle Brown and Dr. Brian Ste@@ wart sat in a room with a man - whom I will name when I &apos;m asked - and offered him a job in my st@@ ables to provide information about what I do inside my st@@ ables , &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy on Rac@@ ing@@ .com . &quot;
they seem to believe that I am a sc@@ am .
&quot; if that is the case , they should certainly believe in their n@@ oses , because they failed in trying to seize me . &quot;
&quot; Robert Rou@@ l@@ ston , former president of R@@ V@@ L , David M@@ oo@@ die , reign@@ ing president of R@@ V@@ L and Bernard Sa@@ undry , current CEO of R@@ V@@ L , were aware of this at that time and are still today . &quot;
should this bring me to the point that it becomes personal ?
has the R@@ V@@ L behave cow@@ ard@@ ly and perhaps makes people outside of trainers responsible for what is going on in the industry ?
am I bad for the industry ?
am I so bad for the industry ?
maybe people are thinking outside that I am .
&quot; perhaps they have to take my license and reject me , and I have no doubt that what I say they can now contem@@ plate . &quot;
&quot; but I am now at the point where it doesn &apos;t matter to me , and that makes me sad . &quot;
that makes me really sad .
I will put pressure on them and urge them to make a decision .
I have the support of my family and I can go .
&quot; the Train@@ ers &apos; Fru@@ str@@ ations Levels were built with the long @-@ lasting cob@@ alt study at Li@@ dar@@ i , and L@@ ate S@@ cr@@ at@@ ching explained that he could &quot; &quot; throw his license over the table &quot; . &quot; &quot;
&quot; M@@ oo@@ dy , best known for its preparation of the unbe@@ aten Master Black C@@ avi@@ ar , described the race day treatment rule &quot; ridi@@ culous &quot; after a pack of mud or clay was applied to the horse strip , which viol@@ ated the rules . &quot;
&quot; it is against the rules of racing .
&quot; I have to take full responsibility for it , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; one of my collabor@@ ators mistakenly put mud on the leg .
it could have been like yesterday evening .
&quot; it would have been like yesterday all day , which was so . &quot;
but it was also the same on the race day .
M@@ oo@@ dy could be confronted with a three @-@ month dis@@ qualification for the treatment with the pack on the race day . an investigation of this matter was opened .
it is a joke .
people who set up these rules do not know about the horse .
&quot; we all see that we need rules , but here we went too far , &quot; &quot; said M@@ oo@@ dy . &quot;
man after driver &apos;s flight arrested
&quot; on the weekend , the police arrested a man after a collision with a cycl@@ ist and driver cur@@ sed in Cob@@ ram . &quot;
&quot; the cycl@@ ist was delivered to the Royal Melbourne hospital with serious injuries by helicopter , after being hit by a car on Saturday morning at the Mur@@ ray Valley Highway . &quot;
the police said the driver drove on without stopping to help the injured driver .
&quot; on Monday , a 50 year old man from N@@ ath@@ alia became the police in Sh@@ ep@@ part@@ on . &quot;
it is expected to be indic@@ ted for driver cur@@ ses and lower assistance and other traffic off@@ ences .
&quot; the cycl@@ ist , a 40 @-@ year @-@ old man from Cob@@ ain , remains in the hospital . it is in a stable condition . &quot;
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy beats against ri@@ vals because of claims to ring competitions
Melbourne @-@ Storm @-@ Trainer Cra@@ ig Bell@@ amy described criticism of the tac@@ kling of his players as &quot; agenda setting &quot; by two Premier League &apos;s favor@@ ites of the N@@ RL .
Sydney R@@ oo@@ ster Trainer Tr@@ ent Robinson said that the refer@@ ees have allowed the Storm players &quot; ring competitions &quot; with his team during the high Storm victory in Sydney on Friday evening .
&quot; Bris@@ ban@@ e Bron@@ cos Trainer Wa@@ yne B@@ enn@@ ett made a very cover@@ t remark about the Storm team , after winning the final victory against North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys on Saturday night . he called the game a &quot; &quot; sample of the Ru@@ g@@ by League &quot; &quot; and said that the two from Que@@ ens@@ land were not &quot; too good &quot; in the struggle . &quot;
Bell@@ amy defended the squ@@ ad of his crew and said that they were concentrated only on their &quot; contact . &quot;
&quot; Bell@@ amy added that the criticism of two leading trainers in his team was confident , as it meant they were worried to be defeated by the Storm team . &quot;
&quot; this repeatedly shows - I haven &apos;t heard that Tr@@ ent Robinson talked about ring @-@ fights when they hit us 24 : 2 , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; but over the past six weeks we have made our contact with Tac@@ tics a real focus , and this has provided for us the turn@@ around . &quot;
&quot; Tr@@ ent has been there for three years now , and obviously he has a great team to train . he &apos;s probably not used to losing it , so it was a bit of shock for him . &quot;
it is funny how this always appears again at this time of the year .
Bell@@ amy has attacked B@@ enn@@ etts &apos;s idea of &quot; exciting football &quot; and reminds his ment@@ or that B@@ enn@@ etts St George Il@@ la@@ war@@ ra Dra@@ gons won the Premier League in 2010 with &quot; boring &quot; football .
Wa@@ yne speaks of exciting football .
&quot; he compared his game on Saturday night with our Friday evening and how exciting her game was , &quot; &quot; said Bell@@ amy . &quot;
&quot; I remember that in 2010 St George was critici@@ zed as a boring team , and Wa@@ yne said that he will take care of a divorce . &quot;
&quot; but now he has a team that can play and which we see as exciting , especially his young players with their speed . &quot;
this is the ball game you want to play when you have this kind of players .
&quot; he made this statement in 2010 , now he wants to play all his kind of football - not every team has two players like Anthony Mil@@ ford and Ben Hun@@ t , so they can play like this . &quot;
I build stronger confidence because they say these things because they are a bit worried to have to play against us .
six weeks ago they didn &apos;t think about us when it was about the big games .
Bell@@ amy also pointed out that the game Storm versus R@@ oo@@ sters made a higher result than the game Bron@@ cos against cow@@ boys .
&quot; the game of the Bron@@ cos was probably a good game , I haven &apos;t seen it yet , but what was the result ? 16 : 12 ? &quot;
&quot; our game was 20 : 18 , there were two more experiments in our game , but is this an exciting game ? &quot;
or are the breaks and no points something exciting ?
for me it &apos;s the game boards .
&quot; when they mention us , it means that we are still going to meet them in one phase . &quot;
&quot; the Storm team is free this weekend , as they have won the right to receive either North Que@@ ens@@ land Cow@@ boys or the C@@ ron@@ ul@@ la Sh@@ arks on the next Saturday evening in the A@@ AM@@ I Park . ticket sales begin next Tuesday morning . &quot;
&quot; Ser@@ bier with 200,000 $ deposit on drugs charges &quot;
&quot; a man who could possibly have a life @-@ long sentence due to his attempt to come into possession of 40 kil@@ os of co@@ ca@@ ine smu@@ g@@ gled to Que@@ ens@@ land was released against a deposit of $ 200,000 . &quot;
&quot; Mark@@ o Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c , 29 , was one of the five men who were arrested last month after the federal police found 100 kg of the drug on the yacht Sol@@ ay , which came from South America via Van@@ u@@ atu and placed in Co@@ om@@ era in August . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was observed how he found his co @-@ defend@@ ants in the marina during the morning and later in the Café Co@@ om@@ era Road@@ house , where the police found 40 kilograms of the drug in a Toyota Echo . &quot;
&quot; despite a potentially life sentence for trying to own a commercial amount of co@@ ca@@ ine , the lawyer of Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c argued that there was no evidence that he tried to own the whole lot and that in the café could have been a harmless reason . &quot;
&quot; the judge at the Supreme Court , Peter Flan@@ agan , was concerned about the risk of flight with Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c . &quot;
he has clear relations with Serbia .
&quot; he often travels to Serbia , &quot; &quot; he explained to the court on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; in the case of a criminal case , he lied to the police about his where@@ ab@@ outs . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c &apos;s mother and step@@ father had offered a security deposit of 200,000 dollars as security jointly to reach his release . &quot;
&quot; after reading the aff@@ i@@ da@@ v@@ its of the two people it is clear that the circulation of a security of 200,000 dollars is a real financial burden , &quot; said Ju@@ dge Flan@@ agan . &quot;
&quot; but that alone will not suff@@ ice to prevent him from appearing , he warned . &quot;
&quot; Mak@@ si@@ movi@@ c was released against security deposit under the conditions that he canc@@ els his Australian and Serbian pas@@ sports , reports to the police every day and considers an initial lock from 18 : 00 to 06 : 00 . &quot;
accident at A@@ 5 near Karlsruhe : cab tear@@ ing apart
&quot; during a rear @-@ collision with three trucks on the motorway 5 near Karlsruhe , a truck driver was seriously injured on Tuesday evening . &quot;
two of the three lor@@ ries involved had bra@@ ked in front of a permanent construction site in the direction of Basel .
&quot; the third driver noticed it too late and tried in vain to turn left in the last moment , as the police said . &quot;
the driver &apos;s cab was completely torn apart .
the driver was seriously injured in a hospital .
the A@@ 5 between Bru@@ chs@@ al and Karlsruhe @-@ Nord was completely closed for six hours until 2 am .
&quot; there was a damage of 12@@ 2,000 Euros . &quot;
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg used phone of girls to l@@ ure pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es for sending images
a ped@@ ophi@@ le used the phone of a 11 @-@ year @-@ old girl to request pictures of child abuse .
St@@ ev@@ an Ho@@ gg took the girl &apos;s phone when he slept and logged into an online mess@@ aging service from which he received a number of un@@ solic@@ ited pictures of children sent to him by another user .
the girl woke up later and discovered that the phone was missing and found it in the hand of the sleeping Ho@@ gg .
she saw it through and found the bewil@@ dering messages and immediately al@@ armed her mother .
&quot; the police took care of this and saw the five images , then analysed computers found under the address and discovered &quot; &quot; relevant &quot; &quot; web research that used terms for searching for un@@ solic@@ ited images of children . &quot;
&quot; Ho@@ gg then claimed to the officials that he did it , as it would lead to &quot; pa@@ ed@@ ophil@@ es on the Internet &quot; and then &quot; preten@@ ding to be a polic@@ eman to frigh@@ ten them . &quot;
&quot; the prosec@@ utor E@@ ili@@ d@@ h Rober@@ ts@@ on told the Dun@@ dee Sh@@ eri@@ ff Court : &quot; &quot; he said it would be an addiction to frigh@@ ten people . &quot;
&quot; he admitted that the searches on the computer were carried out by him , but said it was done because he wanted to be a polic@@ eman to sc@@ are ped@@ ophi@@ le . &quot;
&quot; he was asked for his talks with the unknown person , who sent him the pictures and he asked him to send even more photos . &quot;
he said he did it to l@@ ure her .
&quot; he said he was sick in his head when he drinks , and said he wanted to see pictures of rape and murder . &quot;
MS Rober@@ ts@@ on added : &quot; when the girl found the news on the phone she called her mother and was shaking and crying .
she then also saw the in@@ decent images on the phone and confronted the accused with it .
the girl was inter@@ viewed and said that the accused used computers and pla@@ yst@@ ation to talk to girls who looked much younger than he .
&quot; Ho@@ gg , 23 , W@@ ard Road , Dun@@ dee , ple@@ aded not guilty to the indictment , to have received un@@ decent pictures of children on 14 June last year and not to appear before the court hearing on 24 March this year . &quot;
&quot; defence counsel Greg@@ ory S@@ im asked for Ho@@ gg not to appear in the Registry of sexual offen@@ ders , because he could argue that &quot; &quot; no significant sexual element &quot; &quot; could be found in his off@@ ence . &quot;
Sh@@ eri@@ ff Ali@@ st@@ air Car@@ mi@@ ch@@ ael disappeared from judgment to October in order to obtain background reports on social work .
&quot; Ho@@ gg was granted a security deposit in this case , but was held in custody for hear@@ ings on other pending cases . &quot;
he was added to the list of sexual crimes before the date of judgment .
Schle@@ user switch to Germany on small border cross@@ ings
more and more refugees are taken up away from the large control points on the German @-@ Austrian border .
many smu@@ g@@ gl@@ ers caused the fear of discovery and sei@@ zure of people more and more at smaller border cross@@ ings
&quot; on the Austrian side , a spokes@@ man of the Federal Police said . &quot;
&quot; along the border river Inn , more than 1000 refugees have been taken up in the administrative districts of Passa@@ u and Rot@@ tal @-@ Inn . &quot;
they were on foot over bridges and con@@ ges@@ tion to the German side .
there they are received by Federal Police Offic@@ ers and forwarded to the registration .
&quot; in comparison with the weekend of the week , the Munich Central Station also met with significantly more refugees . &quot;
&quot; about 700 people arrived in the state capital alone until 8 : 00 a.m. , said a spokes@@ man in the morning . &quot;
&quot; after the re@@ introduction of controls on the German @-@ Austrian border , 17@@ 59 refugees had reached the city on Tuesday . &quot;
Stuttgart : pioneer of tropical storm &quot; Henry &quot; expected in the Sou@@ thwest
meteor@@ ologists warn of storm trage@@ dies in the southwest of Wednesday afternoon .
&quot; due to a low pressure area over Western Europe , hot sea air flows into the country , the German Weather Service ( DW@@ D ) distributed in Stuttgart . &quot;
&quot; the powerful low is the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner of the tropical storm &quot; Henry , &quot; which has been pulled over the Atlantic over the past few days . &quot;
storms and storms are expected above all in Baden .
&quot; according to DW@@ D , until Thursday morning also in the Black Forest , on the Sw@@ ab@@ ian Al@@ b and in the bottom @-@ seek@@ er with gu@@ sts of 60 to 90 hours per hour . &quot;
on Friday you can see the sun again .
the mass makes it : every two years the motor@@ boats show their novel@@ ties at the IAA .
&quot; in 2015 , it is mainly moving to the compact cars , which are currently particularly well @-@ selling . &quot;
cars from the compact class are currently in high demand : around 28.@@ 1 per cent of new registr@@ ations came to this segment alone in August alone .
this is also reflected at the IAA ( public days 17 to 27 September ) .
&quot; between all the futur@@ istic concept vehicles and new luxury cars , this year , many new compact models will be presented . &quot;
&quot; Rüssel@@ sheim . one of the biggest premi@@ eres for the German automotive industry is the Opel Astra , which will be available to dealers in autumn . &quot;
&quot; the Astra is an extremely important model for us , &quot; said Opel Group CEO Karl @-@ Thomas Neumann at the fair . &quot;
it belongs to the core of the brand .
&quot; in order for the volume model to be sold well , the new Astra is not to be much more expensive . &quot;
&quot; Opel launches an entry below the biggest competitor VW Golf , which starts at € 17 650 . &quot;
the current Astra will cost from 16 9@@ 90 euros .
the Astra is available with a new 1.4 @-@ liter engine with 74 kW / 100 hp .
&quot; in addition , the H@@ esse offer further diesel and gasoline engines of 70 kW / 95 hp to 147 kW / / 200 hp , for the first time also three @-@ cylinder petrol engines . &quot;
&quot; unlike the most important competitors VW Golf and Ford Focus , the Opel Astra is only available as a five @-@ door Astra . &quot;
&quot; the second variant will follow in the spring of the Com@@ bi , which can also be seen at the IAA . &quot;
and what will be added to new compact cars next to the Astra at the IAA ?
Renault Mé@@ gan@@ e : Renault shoots the fourth generation of its Astra opponent Mé@@ gan@@ e .
&quot; at the fair , the Mé@@ gan@@ e can only be seen as a five @-@ door in a conventional and a high@@ lighting sporty GT @-@ version . &quot;
&quot; in the trade he comes in early next year , then also as a comb@@ i . &quot;
Infin@@ iti : new in the segment is the Infin@@ iti Q@@ 30 .
the Nissan guy wants to find his position in the strongly growing segment with the new model .
&quot; in doing so , the compact Infin@@ iti with its curved lines fit into the brand &apos;s design line . &quot;
the basic model will get a petrol engine with an output of at least 90 kW / 122 hp .
but the offer also includes a diesel with 80 kW / 109 hp or 125 kW / 170 hp .
&quot; Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno : new in the segment is the Su@@ zu@@ ki Bal@@ eno , which is celebrating its world premiere in Frankfurt . &quot;
&quot; the model is offered with gasoline engines , including a newly developed 1.0 liter turbo engine and an output of 82 kW / 111 hp . &quot;
the maximum torque is up to 170 new@@ ton meters ( Nm ) according to manufacturer &apos;s specifications .
sales launch of the Bal@@ eno in Europe is in spring 2016 .
&quot; DS 4 : not completely new , but completely renewed is the compact class model DS 4 , which can be seen at the IAA . &quot;
&quot; outside , the designers of the noble Cit@@ ro@@ ë@@ n @-@ Ab@@ leg@@ ger drew their attention to the front section : here the radiator gri@@ lle was re@@ drawn and the modified head@@ lights are equipped with LED technology . &quot;
&quot; in the interior , especially the inf@@ ot@@ ainment system was moderni@@ zed , the number of buttons was reduced by a touch screen and integrated Ap@@ ples Car@@ Play for the first time . &quot;
&quot; in addition , at the IAA in the compact class , there are a number of re@@ visions and new variants such as the rear @-@ mounted Mercedes A @-@ Class or the Peugeot 30@@ 8 G@@ TI . &quot;
J@@ VA Berlin @-@ Te@@ gel : five square meters of cell are un@@ worthy
&quot; the Federal Constitutional Court has given a right to an ex @-@ prisoner of the Law School Te@@ gel , which has been housed in a small cell for months . &quot;
&quot; because of the violation of their human dignity , prisoners are entitled to financial compensation whenever they are housed in small cells . &quot;
&quot; in a decision published on Wednesday , the Federal Constitutional Court decided this . &quot;
&quot; according to the judges , the persons concerned can even hope for money if they were locked in confined spaces for a few days ( A@@ z . : 1 Bv@@ R 1@@ 127 / 14 ) . &quot;
&quot; with this , an ex @-@ det@@ ain@@ ee with his constitutional complaint was successful in Karlsruhe : he was placed in a solitary cell with about five square meters of floor space between June and November 2009 ; the toilet was not separated spati@@ ally . &quot;
&quot; after that , the man , who now finds himself at the open foot , has moved to a larger cell . &quot;
his arrest warrant was failed because of the un@@ worthy conditions of detention against the Land Berlin .
&quot; however , the judges raised the judgment of the Berlin Chamber Court and rejected the case for re @-@ trial there . &quot;
they see the man &apos;s dignity hurt .
court decision now decides on the amount of compensation
&quot; even if for legal reasons only a few days of liability for the compensation were authorit@@ ative , a compensation claim was given . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , &quot; &quot; a cur@@ v@@ ature of the legal protection of the personality would be feared . &quot; &quot; &quot;
the Court of Appe@@ al must now clarify the amount of the ground damage .
&quot; in the past , the judges have often strengthened the rights of prisoners of war . &quot;
&quot; only in April , they spoke to a det@@ ain@@ ee of damages because he was naked in a cell . &quot;
&quot; according to a decision from 2011 , the multiple occupancy of a cell without separate toilet is un@@ worthy . &quot;
&quot; in addition , on Wednesday , Karlsruhe also confirmed the Berlin Constitutional Court , which had an in@@ decent housing agreement to a det@@ ain@@ ee in a parallel case in November 2009 . &quot;
&quot; for three months , the pla@@ inti@@ ff was lod@@ ged between 15 to 21 hours a day in a similar cell as in the Karlsruhe case . &quot;
&quot; in recent weeks , the pris@@ ons of Berlin have also come into the head@@ lines due to lack of personnel . &quot;
&quot; for this reason , prisoners are imprisoned again and again for 23 hours , which increases aggres@@ si@@ veness , even in fights it should have already come because of the ten@@ se situation . &quot;
&quot; following information from the Justiz@@ pres@@ se@@ stelle 21 positions in Te@@ gel are not occupied because of the lack of a young man , 19 should fall away in 2016 . &quot;
Angela Merkel and the refugee policy : &quot; we create this &quot;
the immigration of refugees is an enormous challenge - the Federal Chancellor is determined to accept them .
what comes to Germany ?
&quot; some 800 000 asylum seekers will come to Germany according to forecasts by the German Federal Ministry of Interior , according to Vice Chancellor Sig@@ mar Gabriel ( SPD ) , Germany is even able to take up a million refugees . &quot;
&quot; German Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) demonstrated in the face of the unusual challenge : &quot; &quot; I say again and again : we can do that , and we can do that . &quot;
what is coming up in Germany gives the following overview .
&quot; according to various progn@@ oses , between 350@@ 000 ( estimate of the Federal Ministry of Agriculture ) and 400@@ ,000 ( estimate of the P@@ est@@ el Institute ) apartments are used annually - and for the next five years . &quot;
&quot; this is almost twice as much , as has been built up to now ( 250@@ ,000 apartments ) . &quot;
&quot; the lack of living space is dramatic , but above all with affordable rental objects : annually , 60,000 to 80@@ ,000 social housing fall out of the rental price , and for these particularly favourable apartments , refugees are also eligible to apply . &quot;
&quot; Federal Minister Barbara Hend@@ ri@@ cks ( SPD ) therefore wants to double the funding , from currently 5@@ 18 million to one billion euros . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ est@@ el Institute &apos;s point of view is far too little from the point of view of the P@@ est@@ el Institute : 80@@ ,000 social housing needs to be built every year and the federal government would have to invest in the amount of 6.@@ 4 billion euros per year . &quot;
&quot; on the other hand , scientists and federal government ministers agree that there must also be more tax benefits for investments in housing construction . &quot;
&quot; according to estimates by the Institute for Employment Research , 55 per cent of the refugees in Germany can be employed in the long term . &quot;
&quot; however , the refugees in Germany would not be systematically asked for their qualifications to help them get started , Claudia Walter , project manager for integration and education in the Ber@@ tel@@ smann Foundation . &quot;
&quot; for the integration of refugees , however , it is crucial to find employment in Germany . &quot;
&quot; work is the key to social contacts , for the appreciation in the host society , but also for the self @-@ esteem of immigrants , says migration researcher Dietrich Thr@@ än@@ hardt . &quot;
&quot; in Germany , according to the Thr@@ es@@ man , there has been a political change : from the prohibition of labour for refugees to recognise work . &quot;
&quot; while there was a prohibition of employment for asylum seekers of up to five years earlier , this was reduced to three months in November 2014 , as well as the obligation of residence to limit asylum seekers to a residential area . &quot;
&quot; in society , also because of the shortage of skilled labour , the point of view prevailed that refugees should be quicker access to the labour market . &quot;
a major hur@@ dle to access the labour market is a lack of knowledge of German .
&quot; up to now , there is no sufficient supply of general and occupational language courses . &quot;
studies also show that jobs are most often medi@@ ated through personal contacts .
&quot; therefore , the construction of networks is the Königs@@ weg path to work integration . &quot;
&quot; the Berlin School Administration has found that only a few committed parents give their children into the kit@@ ties , an estimated ten to 15 per cent : &quot; for the u@@ pro@@ oted parents it is only very important to keep the family together , &quot; says Il@@ ja Ko@@ gler , spokes@@ man for youth and family in the Senate Administration . &quot;
&quot; in order to convince the family nevertheless of the advantages of the K@@ ita , the administration distri@@ butes manuals in various languages . &quot;
&quot; if the need for educ@@ ators to rise strongly by the large number of refugees , the Berlin Senate would try to increase training capacity - for instance by allowing more specialised schools . &quot;
students without knowledge of German will be prepared for classes in the countries without knowledge of German .
&quot; however , they are not always taught by fully trained teachers , but , like in Berlin , also by teachers who only have a qualification in German as a second language . &quot;
&quot; there is no shortage of them , says Be@@ ate St@@ at from the Berlin School of School . &quot;
the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk estimates that about 20 percent of the refugees in Germany want to study .
&quot; in principle , no federal state banned asylum seekers or tolerated the study - the only exception was Berlin , the inner sen@@ ator Frank Henkel ( CD@@ U ) has now abandoned its position . &quot;
students who are willing to study could be reli@@ eved of access to the university .
&quot; for refugees with a refund or toler@@ ation do not receive any services after the asylum application law , when they start studying . &quot;
&quot; in principle , the latter do not get a b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , since they do not fall under the circle of the legitimate persons . &quot;
&quot; patient refugees had to have lived in Germany for four years to be eligible for b@@ af@@ ö@@ g , from 1 January 2016 to 15 months . &quot;
&quot; but this financing gap must also be closed , demanded Steffen Kra@@ ch , Berlin &apos;s Secretary of State for Science , and the Deutsche Studenten@@ werk . &quot;
the students should get b@@ af@@ ö@@ g immediately .
&quot; Islam will play a more important role in future because many refugees are Muslims , and for many , religion is an important part of their identity . &quot;
&quot; the state should gradually integrate the same rights to Islam as they have the churches , and the existing state church law will continue to develop into a new state @-@ religions relationship . &quot;
it would also be important to establish an Islamic welfare organization that takes care of the newcom@@ ers professionally .
the rights also include duties .
&quot; in this way , the representatives of Islam need to agree on a clear contact person and be willing to work with the state in many areas and grant him certain control options . &quot;
this also includes the willingness to face religious fundament@@ alism .
&quot; the Chairman of the Central Council of Muslims , A@@ im@@ an Maz@@ ye@@ k , expressed the concern , religious conflicts could also be carried into Germany on Thursday . &quot;
&quot; those who wanted to squee@@ ze such conflicts in Germany immediately have their right to stay here , in Germany , &quot; he said in the Bay@@ erischer Rundfunk . &quot;
he proposed to translate the Basic Law on Arabic .
&quot; in the future , integration will be a topic of the entire society even more today than today . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the majority society will have to change , reducing discrimination and racism . &quot;
Germany has - as a result of European decisions - a decade of anti @-@ discrimination and a general gender equality law .
&quot; but it is very slow to learn how the NS@@ U @-@ murder @-@ series showed , in which the police and authorities systematically ignored the rac@@ ist motive . &quot;
&quot; equal opportunities for all : what migrant organisations and interest groups of non @-@ white Germans have long demanded and what international tre@@ aties such as the anti @-@ racism convention in Germany ob@@ lige Germany must become reality in the coming years , if the country remains peaceful and its new citizens should use its opportunities - for the benefit of all . &quot;
&quot; in general , Germany is in a position to provide medical assistance to the refugees that have been waiting to date , &quot; &quot; said Medical Minister Frank Ulrich Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery . &quot;
&quot; as far as power and capacity is concerned , we create this , &quot; he said to the Tages@@ spiegel . &quot;
&quot; however , additional money needs to flow into the system . &quot;
&quot; to avoid bot@@ t@@ len@@ ecks , Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery calls on all newcom@@ ers directly at the registration of health cards . &quot;
recovered services could be rep@@ uted later with the federal states .
&quot; and in the long term , it is highly question@@ able to leave so many people with the limited catalogue of services that the asylum application law provides . &quot;
&quot; otherwise , the doctors mainly do the language barriers . &quot;
&quot; so far , the Berlin health scientist The@@ a Bor@@ de has proven that migrants are getting better informed about their illnesses than other patients . &quot;
&quot; not only in clinics , also in doctor &apos;s offices , interpreting costs would have to be taken over , it demands . &quot;
&quot; however , many refugees would also be helped with more general medical centres in the emergency ambul@@ ances . &quot;
and with another diagnostic view .
&quot; among refugee children , for example , there are significantly more un@@ treated disabilities , and with the young people it is about HIV awareness . &quot;
&quot; with the partly other diseases of the disease , German doctors come from their training , but Mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery says . &quot;
&quot; paras@@ ite inf@@ estation or tuber@@ cu@@ lo@@ sis are not so difficult to recognize . &quot; &quot; and as for the shortage of doctors , the refugees may be even allevi@@ ated . &quot;
&quot; the Syrians would have a highly developed education system , several refugees are even doctors . &quot;
&quot; to be allowed to practice , however , they would have to prove their qualifications and possibly disc@@ ard ex@@ ams . &quot;
at least half of the refugees arriving in Germany are mentally ill according to estimates by the German Psych@@ otherap@@ ist Association ( B@@ P@@ t@@ K ) : most suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder or depression .
&quot; especially vulnerable are refugee children , explains Dietrich Mun@@ z , President of the B@@ P@@ t@@ K . &quot;
a recently published study by the TU München shows that every fifth Syrian refugee child is traumati@@ zed in Germany .
&quot; those who suffer from a post @-@ trau@@ matic stress disorder , among other things , suffers from so @-@ called flash@@ backs with short@@ ness of breath , di@@ zz@@ iness , heart rate and death . &quot;
&quot; other symptoms are sleep and concentration problems , strong anxiety and emotional num@@ b@@ ness . &quot;
&quot; to prevent the symptoms to be chronic , early treatment is necessary , explained Mun@@ z . &quot;
&quot; until now , only four percent of the psych@@ ologically ill refugees receive psych@@ otherapy . &quot;
&quot; although psych@@ ologically ill seekers can request a psych@@ otherapy application in the social offices , however , the treatment usually takes several months . &quot;
&quot; in addition , in the social offices mostly non @-@ cler@@ ks or doctors , who are not trained for mental illnesses , decide whether a therapy is necessary or not . &quot;
&quot; this often leads to mis@@ calculations , says Mun@@ z . &quot;
Man@@ ege invites to dream
&quot; with the new production &quot; Passion , &quot; the Circus Pro@@ bst looks back on the traditions of circus arts . &quot;
&quot; the goal is to attract each age group to captiv@@ ating ac@@ rob@@ atics , animal combines and unique entertainment . &quot;
now the Circus Pro@@ bst looks into the man@@ ege on a brick and v@@ ases to dream .
&quot; our passion is the circus . &quot;
&quot; I can &apos;t imagine living without my circus family , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst , Ti@@ erle@@ hr@@ erin and Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; passion &quot; &quot; - under this motto is the current management stage . &quot;
&quot; for more than 33 years , the circus has been in the hands of the Pro@@ bst family . &quot;
the gift for enthusiasts is thus in the blood of the family .
&quot; it is important to us to bring people away from their everyday lives and take them into a completely different world for two hours , &quot; emphas@@ ises the 27 @-@ year @-@ old Juni@@ or@@ ch@@ ef@@ in . &quot;
&quot; Man@@ e@@ gene cocktail with cosm@@ opolitan flair , &quot; says director Reinhard Pro@@ bst his concept . &quot;
50 cities on the barely 3@@ 000@@ km long tour can now experience this flair .
circus shows talented artists all over the world .
&quot; awarded at the International Circus Festival in Monte Carlo , the Russian Sto@@ li@@ aro@@ v C@@ lown Family will captiv@@ ate audiences with wit and charm . &quot;
the Castillo Brothers also understand their craft .
&quot; with the heroes of the silent movies , the Cuban duo wants to easily record . &quot;
&quot; light@@ ness and ag@@ ility - with these words , they identify themselves . &quot;
her humor@@ ous art at the mast is meant to conquer women &apos;s hearts in a storm .
&quot; apart from numerous laughter sal@@ ts , the ac@@ rob@@ atics of the Circus Pro@@ bst also fascin@@ ates with t@@ act and articul@@ ation . &quot;
balance with the un@@ ic@@ ycle on a ball ?
no problem for He y@@ uan .
snake @-@ like fascin@@ ate and frigh@@ ten at the same time .
W@@ ang L@@ in from China is familiar with the oldest form of ac@@ rob@@ atics as little else and fascin@@ ates with its ag@@ ility .
60 employees from twelve nations offer variety in every respect .
&quot; the animals belong to our family , &quot; emphasizes Steph@@ an@@ ies &apos;s mother , Brigitte Pro@@ bst . &quot;
ab@@ norm@@ alities in the attitude of circus animals are only too often a topic for various animal protection organizations .
Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst also takes a stand : &quot; if it is not good for our animals it is not good for us . &quot;
around 80 animals from five different continents enjoy each pet@@ ting unit .
&quot; the &quot; &quot; four @-@ leg@@ ged artists &quot; , &quot; as they are lovingly called , will be read from the eyes whenever possible . &quot;
we want to work with animals and have fun with them .
&quot; if the animal does not feel at ease , it does not want to go into the arena . &quot;
the highest commandment : good for the animals .
&quot; especially on her zeb@@ roid jum@@ bo , a mixture of a Sh@@ et@@ land P@@ ony stallion and a zeb@@ ra mare , the family Pro@@ bst is proud . &quot;
the two animals lived together for eight years in an enclosure and nothing happened .
&quot; but then , suddenly , our little Jum@@ bo da was there , &quot; Brigitte Pro@@ bst says . &quot;
&quot; the zeb@@ roid is still not ready for the arena , but it &apos;s the unique mas@@ cot of Circus Pro@@ bst . &quot;
there should be something for every visitor .
&quot; one thing is certain , &quot; says Steph@@ anie Pro@@ bst : &quot; no matter if five or a hundred spectators , we always do our best and are with all our heart . &quot;
the Circus Pro@@ bst invites to its performances from 17 to 20 September daily at 5 pm and 8 pm .
on Sunday the program will start at 11 a.m. and 4 p.m .
&quot; Thursday is a family day , for the presentation at 5 pm the prices are dis@@ counted . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the ti@@ sh@@ au is open daily from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. &quot;
Zimbabwe &apos;s Robert Mu@@ gabe delivers false speech in parliament
&quot; Mr Mu@@ gabe , Africa &apos;s el@@ dest leader , fell down the stairs from a podium at the beginning of the year . &quot;
&quot; he remained un@@ har@@ med , but the video of the Falls spread quickly across the social media . &quot;
the opening of the Parliament was also clou@@ ded by alle@@ gations made by de@@ pu@@ ties of the opposition that they had received anonymous deaths and warned them to accompany Mr Mu@@ gabe &apos;s address with Bu@@ hr@@ ufen .
last month they had bu@@ sted him and interrupted him during his speech on the situation of the nation in parliament - this is the speech he repeated on Tuesday .
spokes@@ man of the Movement for Democratic Change ( M@@ DC ) In@@ no@@ cent Gon@@ ese said that seven opposition politicians have received SMS messages on their phones that warned them to dis@@ rupt Mr. Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech .
&quot; the message comes from a number that is not shown , but it has the title &apos; Death &apos; , &quot; &quot; he said to journalists after Mu@@ gabe &apos;s speech . &quot;
&quot; it warns European Parliament members that immunity ends in the Parliament , and as soon as they leave the Parliament , their parliamentary immunity is no longer effective . &quot;
the chief speaker said that the party led by Morgan T@@ s@@ van@@ gi@@ ra@@ i was &quot; concerned &quot; about the dangers for politicians .
H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard will reduce up to 30.000 jobs
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard is expected to reduce 25,000 to 30,000 jobs within the scope of restructuring and savings efforts in the company &apos;s services . &quot;
&quot; HP will split into two listed companies later this year , and will separate the computer and printer business from its fast growing company hardware and service activities . &quot;
&quot; the expected loss of jobs leads to a burden of more than 2.@@ 7 billion dollars from the fourth quarter , HP said in an explanation . &quot;
&quot; these restructuring measures will enable a more competitive , more sustainable cost structure for the new H@@ ew@@ lett @-@ Packard @-@ Enterprise , &quot; said Me@@ g Whit@@ man , HP Chairman and Chief Executive who will lead the unit after separation . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Packard Enterprise will be smaller and more focused than HP today , and we have a broad and deep@@ ened portfolio of businesses that support businesses in transition to a new style of business , &quot; Whit@@ man said . &quot;
&quot; as an independent company , we are better positioned than ever to satisfy the changing needs of our customers all over the world . &quot;
&quot; H@@ ew@@ lett Packard Enterprise has more than $ 50 billion annual turnover and &quot; will be focused on providing previously un@@ paralleled , integrated technology solutions for companies , &quot; &quot; says a statement by the company . &quot;
it divi@@ des a company that was founded in the 1930s by graduates of Stan@@ ford University Bill H@@ ew@@ lett and Dave Packard in order to produce electric systems and their Pal@@ o Alto Garage was called &quot; the birth@@ place of Si@@ licon Valley . &quot;
HP has undergone a massive restructuring to tackle hom@@ ec@@ oming from traditional PCs to mobile devices .
&quot; HP , the world &apos;s second largest PC manufacturer and one of the largest U.S. tech companies , is the latest in this field based on the belief that closely focused companies are delivering a better performance . &quot;
FC Arsenal @-@ Captain Mik@@ el Art@@ eta says that team @-@ mates must stand before the game against Dynam@@ o Zagreb behind the injured Jack Wil@@ sh@@ ere
&quot; Wen@@ ger emphas@@ ised Wil@@ sh@@ ere that it was only September and if his rehabilitation goes according to plan , there is no reason why he can &apos;t play again before Christmas . &quot;
&quot; this optimistic scenario already means that Wil@@ sh@@ ere will certainly miss at least the next four games for England , and in the face of his history , his participation in the next summer at the European Championship is certainly uncertain . &quot;
the big shame in this current problem is that Wil@@ sh@@ ere finished the last season after a separate ank@@ le injury and then returned to his old momentum during the previous season .
&quot; this kind of injury does not thre@@ aten the career , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it is a bone that did not heal well .
this is not a major issue .
this was just an accident .
it was not in connection with his k@@ nu@@ ck@@ les or with the injuries he had before .
&quot; this may be true from a purely medical point of view , but like Wen@@ ger also recognized , there is the associated danger of further injuries , whenever a player tries to return in the middle of the season . &quot;
it also develops an unpleasant pattern .
the investigation of Prime Minister Inj@@ uries Ltd has recorded 23 different diseases by Wil@@ sh@@ ere since his debut six years ago .
he also played in only 65 of Arsen@@ als 157 league games in the last five seasons .
the wider picture for Arsenal is that they were one of the two Premier League Clubs in six of eight seasons since 2007 / 08 that have recorded most of the injuries .
&quot; Wen@@ ger accepts the potential of a vi@@ cious circle , but arsen@@ al believes that improvement will last during the last season . &quot;
&quot; sometimes , when you come back from an injury , you have a due time period , a time in which you need to strengthen your body and win fighting power , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
Jack is young enough to overcome that .
&quot; I hope that his body stabili@@ zes , I am confident that he will do it and he will go through a career of the way he deserves . &quot;
&quot; Arsenal ki@@ cks off its Champions League season on Wednesday night against Din@@ amo Zagreb before playing against Chelsea on Saturday and against Tot@@ ten@@ ham Hot@@ spur on Wednesday , and Wen@@ ger is a rotation within the team . &quot;
&quot; H@@ é@@ c@@ tor Bell@@ er@@ ín and Aaron Ram@@ sey have not travelled to Croatia , which means that Math@@ ie@@ u Deb@@ u@@ chy and Art@@ eta should start . &quot;
Wen@@ ger can also begin with K@@ ier@@ an Gib@@ bs and Oli@@ vier Gi@@ rou@@ d instead of Nach@@ o Mon@@ real and Theo Wal@@ cot@@ t .
&quot; I try to keep the balance and treat the players who need to break a little break , &quot; Wen@@ ger said . &quot;
&quot; although Arsenal &apos;s clear favor@@ ites are to pass by group F , the Mak@@ si@@ mir stadium in Zagreb is one of the play@@ grounds with the biggest in@@ timi@@ dation effect in Europe . &quot;
&quot; dynam@@ o is also unbe@@ aten after 41 games , after the &quot; &quot; inv@@ inci@@ ble &quot; &quot; campaign has started in the last season . &quot;
&quot; the stadium was sha@@ ken by an earthquake on Tuesday evening , measuring 3,@@ 2 on the Richter scale . &quot;
this year it was 10th in Zagreb .
&quot; Wen@@ ger believes that Arsenal boo@@ sted the lesson from the past season with the champi@@ ons League capit@@ ulation against Monaco , and remains driven by the far @-@ reaching hope to lead the association to its first European banking triumph with its management . &quot;
&quot; this drive is immense , &quot; said Wen@@ ger . &quot;
it has never worked out at Arsenal .
&quot; we were very close to it in 2006 , but on the other hand I am long enough in business to be realistic . &quot;
&quot; we are ambitious , but we are not dre@@ am@@ ers . &quot;
friendship Festival : the comedy show that gives us serious lessons about men &apos;s friend@@ ships
&quot; the absence of similar representations in shows is obvious , especially with regard to how the need for men to open up is now even more desperate than ever before , how suicide rates among young men prove on a 15 @-@ year high . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , it was the most important cause of death in men between 20 and 45 in Great Britain , and it remains three times more common in men than women . &quot;
&quot; in an effort to tackle the problem , the Campa@@ ign Against Living Mis@@ er@@ ably ( Cal@@ m campaign against a mis@@ erable life ) 2015 announced as the year of the man , aiming to question the culture that prevents men from seeking help when they need them . &quot;
friendship is the heart of the struggle to overcome this challenge .
&quot; a recent study involving more than 2,000 high school students with depres@@ sive symptoms stated that if the suff@@ erer had a sufficiently high percentage of friends with &quot; healthy mood , &quot; his chances of recovery doubled . &quot;
&quot; for those who are not de@@ pressed , a circle of mentally healthy friends hal@@ ves the risks of mental problems . &quot;
but of course you have to have friends to make a friendship .
&quot; in the age of communication managed through social media , with emphasis on the style of substance , the immedi@@ acy of the answer is often more important than a meaningful contact . &quot;
&quot; our digital life has doubled the need to appear strong , li@@ ve@@ able and successful , even if in reality isolation dominates . &quot;
&quot; this superficial success is dominated by what psych@@ ologists call ex@@ trin@@ sic values ; money , image , social status , all at the expense of in@@ trin@@ sic values - our inner longing for personal development and friendship , which affects our mental health a lot deeper . &quot;
&quot; and as a video game inventor and billi@@ on@@ aire recently declared , money can really not buy happiness . &quot;
the beauty of Friends was that this focuss@@ ing was put on the head .
&quot; each character was defined not by his work , but by his personality , which sh@@ one through interaction as a friend . &quot;
&quot; the humour of Jo@@ ey and Ch@@ and@@ ler frequent hu@@ gs , moments at football gu@@ cks in comfortable arm@@ chairs and the desire of Ross to Rachel - all this came from the knowledge that men can refer to each case even if they often hold back to fully explore their feelings . &quot;
&quot; as an employee of the phone pastoral care told me , &quot; &quot; My listening role for people who feel de@@ pressed and at risk of suicide has clearly shown me how even the smallest interactions of friends can make a difference . &quot;
the men who contact us feel often unable to talk with friends .
&quot; the old saying &quot; &quot; I come along with it &quot; &quot; has a tremendous impact , like the feeling that it is perceived as a weakness if you talk about problems openly . &quot;
friends is one of the shows that comes to mind when I try to offer long @-@ term cop@@ ing mechanisms .
it clearly presents the small moments of men friend@@ ships .
so much my objective out@@ sider status over the phone may help people in moments of despair also may help the long @-@ term support comes from a personal network of family and friends .
&quot; and so , if you visit Com@@ edy Central Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration to celebrate the day completely re@@ designed cou@@ l@@ isse , why not take your friends for a drink in Central Per@@ k . &quot;
&quot; or , even better if you see someone sitting in Star@@ bu@@ cks alone , give him a smile and say h@@ ello . &quot;
you never know what difference your friendship could make .
friends are sent to comedy Central from beginning to end - the total 2@@ 36 episodes - for # Friend@@ s@@ Celeb@@ ration
di Maria meets to help PS@@ G to cr@@ ush Malm@@ ö
angel Di Maria celebrates with Bla@@ ise Mat@@ u@@ id@@ i and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani after his hit against Malm@@ ö .
&quot; at his debut in the Champions League , di Maria meets on Tuesday and helps PS@@ G to pass over to Malm@@ ö . &quot;
here are the game report and the reaction to the game .
angel Di Maria and Ed@@ die Cav@@ ani held a course when Paris Saint @-@ Ger@@ main started his Champions League season with an extremely comfortable 2 @-@ 0 victory against Malm@@ ö in the Prin@@ zen@@ park@@ sta@@ dion on Tuesday .
&quot; di Maria made less than four minutes after the launch of his Champions League debut as PS@@ G player who brought the French master to the road , but after that she missed a number of occasions before she finally raised her lead when Cav@@ ani scored a head coach in the 6@@ 1st minute . &quot;
&quot; with Real Madrid and chess t@@ j@@ or Don@@ et@@ sk also in group A , Paris also needs a strong start against the Swedish champion , as it does not only aim for the qualification for the kno@@ ck@@ out rounds , but an improvement on the way to the quarter fin@@ als in each of the last three campaigns . &quot;
&quot; but while they got the points , there was no clas@@ ses@@ pi@@ el of Laurent Blan@@ cs team with Zlat@@ an I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ cs missed chances in front of the gate . he was later replaced in the game against his hom@@ etown team and against the club , with which he began his illustri@@ ous career in 1999 . &quot;
&quot; it is not easy to win at home or abroad in the Champions League . therefore , it is a good start to win 2 : 0 to cause problems to our opponents , even if there are certain things that we have to perfect in the course of the season , &quot; &quot; said Blanc . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; this is a good omen . &quot;
&quot; we wanted to win and we won , although I regret that we did not have one or two other gates . &quot;
&quot; I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c returned after his injury in one of three changes to the Paris team , which could last weekend a 2 : 2 Draw at his own place against Bordeaux in the First League , but he was stab@@ bed by Di Maria in the fourth minute . &quot;
&quot; the Argent@@ inian imp@@ eller was referred to as the man who took PS@@ G to the next stage in Europe when he was taken over in the last month of Manchester United , and he pointed out why when he passed in to Johan Wil@@ and past the long corner of the network . &quot;
&quot; however , if someone believed that PS@@ G would achieve a great victory , he was disappointed . &quot;
&quot; Malm@@ ö , who hit the Celtic in a play @-@ off to reach this level , came up with nine national players on the field and with a five @-@ man defense and two deep in the middle field lined up a heavy enemy . &quot;
&quot; but besides a shot by Nikol@@ a D@@ jur@@ d@@ j@@ ic , who passed far to Kevin Tra@@ pps in the 3@@ 4th minute , they offered little in the attack . &quot;
&quot; instead , PS@@ G sometimes appeared , with some patches of fla@@ ws and bad connections , not least by I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , who retired at no less than five attempts alone in the first half and then abandoned after the re @-@ launch of Cav@@ ani . &quot;
&quot; nevertheless he proved a lot more skill when he brought his fellow players to the game , and it was a pass from I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c , which Di Maria turned into a shooting shot by Wil@@ and in the 5@@ 2nd minute at the pole . &quot;
the second gate finally fell short after the hours mark thanks to Cav@@ ani . the Urugu@@ ay@@ an accomplished his sixth round of the season after I@@ bra@@ hi@@ movi@@ c f@@ ished on a left flan@@ k by Max@@ well .
&quot; that ended all the thoughts that Malm@@ ö could return to the game , and only an excellent intervention from Wil@@ and from the shortest distance to stop David Lu@@ iz was able to keep the end result low before replacement player Ez@@ equi@@ el Lav@@ e@@ zzi finished a gate at the end . &quot;
&quot; the coach of Malm@@ ö , age Har@@ ei@@ de later admitted that PS@@ G played a class over his team and the Norwegian said : &quot; our last champi@@ ons league game was last year in December . &quot;
&quot; since then , we have only played in the Swedish league , which has not the same level . &quot;
the qualification games are not enough . &quot;
hat off in front of Paris !
it was a great game of them !
Gl@@ en@@ core ga@@ thers 2.5 billion dollars through stock sales
&quot; the Gl@@ en@@ core , which is based in Switzerland , is affected by the collap@@ sing raw material prices , collected $ 2.5 billion on Wednesday by a share sale as part of its huge debt relief plan . &quot;
the company Gl@@ en@@ core registered in London said in a statement that it sold new shares worth about € 1.6 billion in order to pay off its own debts .
&quot; the company , which lost 57 percent of its market value this year , fights with falling commodity prices , as China &apos;s economic down@@ turn presses demand and has a devastating impact on markets . &quot;
the issue of subscription rights brought Gl@@ en@@ cores share price at trading on the early Wednesday morning to a rapid rise at the top of the London Stock Exchange .
&quot; the share jumped by 2.@@ 77 percent to 13@@ 1,@@ 60 p@@ ence on the FT@@ SE 100 index , which opened 0.@@ 69 percent higher . &quot;
&quot; last week , Gl@@ en@@ core had announced the $ 2.5 billion share sale as part of the more comprehensive plan to exter@@ min@@ ate around a third of its 30 billion $ debts . &quot;
&quot; the company sold the new shar@@ ehol@@ dings to 125 p@@ ence per share , which meant a 2.4 percent discount on the closing price on Tuesday . &quot;
there were 1.3 billion shares worth up to 9.@@ 99 percent of the Group .
&quot; concerns regarding long @-@ term growth in China have reduced iron ore prices by about half , coal , copper and other raw materials prices have declined by 20 to 40 percent . &quot;

white House confirms Xi Jin@@ ping &apos;s visit to Washington
Chinese President Xi Jin@@ ping will make a state visit to the US at the end of the month confirmed the White House in an explanation on Tuesday .
&quot; the visit , the first official in Washington , takes place on 25 September and responds to President Barack Obama &apos;s trip to Beijing last November , said the statement . &quot;

&quot; his visit to Washington is expected to meet several US technology leaders on his way to Washington , before he moved to New York City to the UN General Assembly in September . &quot;
&quot; it is expected that Obama and Xi appeal to a number of controversial issues , including Washington &apos;s concerns regarding alleged cy@@ ber sp@@ ying in China and its increasing self @-@ confidence in the controversial waters of the South China Sea . &quot;

X@@ av@@ i : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola prevented 2008 transition to FC Bayern
world and European champion X@@ av@@ i has been playing for the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar since summer 2015
&quot; the FC Bayern was obviously just a few years ago , just before the commitment of Spain &apos;s super@@ star X@@ av@@ i , who played for FC Barcelona . &quot;
&quot; eight times Spanish champion , three times Cup winners , four times champion League winner , two times Club World Champion , two times European champion , one time World Champion - the title list of X@@ av@@ i is breathtaking . &quot;
&quot; in the summer , the 35 @-@ year @-@ old left FC Barcelona after 24 years and changed to the al @-@ S@@ add Sport Club in Qatar . &quot;
&quot; but in an interview with Mar@@ ca , X@@ av@@ i now betra@@ ys that he was standing before the European Championships before the departure of Barcelona . &quot;
I told me that Bar@@ ça wanted to sell me .
&quot; Madrid then won everything , we don &apos;t know anything , &quot; he says . &quot;
and the registered also the FC Bayern .
X@@ av@@ i : &quot; there was an offer of Bavaria . &quot;
Rum@@ men@@ ig@@ ge wanted me to have .
&quot; in the summer of 2008 , Jürgen Klin@@ smann took over FC Bayern . &quot;
guar@@ ola was the reason that X@@ av@@ i did not change
but the change did not come about .
and the decisive man for this today works for the German record master : PE@@ P Guardi@@ ola .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i explains why : &quot; &quot; Bar@@ ça has signed Guardi@@ ola and I played a great European . &quot;
PE@@ P told me that I would not change that he couldn &apos;t imagine the crew without me .
&quot; with that he has won me . &quot;
who knows how Bay@@ erns had run with X@@ av@@ i in 2008 / 2009 .
&quot; X@@ av@@ i stood for Bar@@ ca in the quar@@ ter@@ fin@@ als of the Champions League against the Bav@@ arians over the entire distance on the lawn , the red turned out ( 4 : 0 , 1 : 1 ) and at the end celebrated the King &apos;s victory triumph . &quot;
matt Dam@@ on plays a great deal in film@@ making
matt Dam@@ on confronted the af@@ ro @-@ American film@@ maker Eff@@ ie Brown during a discussion about diversity and said she was not needed behind the scenes .
&quot; as a result of the Sunday night of HB@@ OS Project Green@@ light , experienced actor Brown refra@@ ined from empha@@ sizing the need for alternative perspectives in terms of a black protagon@@ ist in the chosen script of the project . &quot;
&quot; if we talk about diversity , then do it with the occupation of the film and not in the occupation of the show , &quot; Dam@@ on assured . &quot;
&quot; brown re@@ acted shocked , with insul@@ t un@@ belief and called &quot; Ho@@ o ! wow . okay &quot; when the commentary of the actor of The Mar@@ tian touched . &quot;
Dam@@ on and Brown joined the producer &apos;s colleagues Ben Aff@@ le@@ ck and the Far@@ rel@@ ly brothers to discuss the show fin@@ alists .
&quot; I would like to ask people to think about - who will always be the director - how they treat the character of the Harmony , &quot; Brown first said . &quot;
&quot; the only black person , and she is a sp@@ lin@@ t , which is beaten by her white p@@ im@@ p . &quot;
&quot; the producer of Dear White People sat down for the fin@@ alists Leo Angel@@ os and Kri@@ sten Bran@@ c@@ accio for directing rights to the film ; Dam@@ on replied that &quot; &quot; in the end , their direction &quot; &quot; could give us something we don &apos;t want . &quot;
&quot; after the discussion was broadcast , the social media explo@@ ded before dis@@ approval of Dam@@ on &apos;s comments . &quot;
&quot; Twitter users Mr Po@@ oni expressed his anger about the clip , writing &quot; Matt Dam@@ on talks about the only black person in the room , so he can explain their diversity - that &apos;s SO WE@@ ISS that it hur@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; the twe@@ et earned more than 5,000 rescu@@ ers and 4,000 ri@@ kes since its release . &quot;
Dam@@ on &apos;s comments come at a time when precise racial representation in the media is at the forefront of social discussion .
&quot; after the teen@@ ager Michael Brown was killed by a white polic@@ eman in 2014 , the Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter Movement achieved nationwide impact and urged leg@@ is@@ lators and authorities to stop discrimin@@ atory practices against the content . &quot;
&quot; in February , the singer Prince made a recording to the movement during the introduction of the nominated albums of the year with the Gram@@ my Awards . &quot;
&quot; album still dull , &quot; ( albums still have their meaning ) he said . &quot;
&quot; as books and black life , albums still have their meaning . &quot;
&quot; more recently , leaders of the Movement Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter published an explanation , in response to the question of the Fox News personality , Elisabeth Has@@ sel@@ beck , whether the group should be regarded as a hate group . &quot;
&quot; the network Black Li@@ ves Mat@@ ter is a love group , &quot; &quot; said the leaders . &quot;
&quot; recently it was announced that Dam@@ on was on a list of enter@@ tain@@ ers , producers and media mo@@ gu@@ le , invited to visit the Pope to discuss the representation of the Catholic Church in the West . &quot;
whether he has accepted the invitation or has already met the Pope is unclear .
&apos;@@ American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or &apos; crowned first champion
professional sports clim@@ ber and operator Isaac Cal@@ di@@ ero became the first ath@@ lete to win the American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or on Monday evening and took home the Grand Prize of $ 1 million .
&quot; the competition show , which had just completed their 7th season , had never experienced a competition participant which could complete all levels of his obstacle course . &quot;
&quot; during the season finale , there were two men , Cal@@ di@@ ero and cam@@ er@@ aman Ge@@ off Brit@@ ten up to the final . &quot;
&quot; to the last task , climbing on a 75 foot long climbing rope was completed in 30 seconds . &quot;
&quot; Brit@@ ten ended the task in time with which he was the first ath@@ lete to complete the stren@@ uous phase 4 of American Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or . however , Cal@@ di@@ ero finished this challenge full three seconds faster , which made him the winner . &quot;
&quot; Cal@@ di@@ ero spoke to E ! news after the hard @-@ fought victory , still under shock over the win of the Grand Prix of $ 1 million . &quot;
&quot; I mean it &apos;s amazing to think about it , I &apos;ve never earned more than $ 10,000 or had life , &quot; &quot; said Isaac E ! about his he@@ ap of money . &quot;
suddenly .. as I can &apos;t even imagine how this is ... the future is unknown .
&quot; the leading producer K@@ ent We@@ ed sat down with The Hollywood Re@@ porter to discuss the final and why Brit@@ ten , although he first finished the course , did not get any prize money . &quot;
&quot; after the rules , the money goes to the fastest person . &quot;
&quot; if there are more than one fin@@ alist , it gets the one with the fastest time , &quot; &quot; said We@@ ed . &quot;
&quot; how much money is a wonderful price and life changes , it gets the great Gr@@ ati@@ fication . &quot;
I don &apos;t think he has any gru@@ dge over it .
he is just as happy to have done what he did .
he received masses of awards from fans .
he is such a great guy and a family father .
he is a hero for his children and his wife .
&quot; Ge@@ off said to me , &quot; &quot; If I should be struck by someone , then I am glad that Isaac is . &quot;
and I think Isaac would have felt the same if they had exchanged the roles .
America Nin@@ ja Warri@@ or was extended for an eighth season ; filming will begin in the spring of 2016 .
Detroit Tig@@ ers sne@@ ak over to Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins
the second half of the season was not particularly funny for the Detroit Tig@@ ers .
&quot; once again , they were one of the best teams in bas@@ eball , today the Tig@@ ers are on the last place in the American League Central . &quot;
the Tig@@ ers were reduced to their role as spo@@ iler but played this part perfectly against the Minn@@ es@@ ota T@@ wins with 5 @-@ 4 in the Target field on Tuesday .
the T@@ wins had a chance to climb up within one half of the Houston branch for the second American League Wild@@ card .
&quot; for Detroit , though only for one evening , it was a return of the three letter F word that was so difficult to hold over a large part of the second half of the season . &quot;
&quot; all wins are fun , no matter how it comes , &quot; said Tig@@ ers Manager Brad Aus@@ sie . &quot;
&quot; tiger @-@ Pit@@ cher Al@@ fre@@ do Simon held his early offensive support , when Detroit pun@@ ctu@@ ated three times in the first two inside , then once in sixth and then once again in the ninth . &quot;
Simon ( 13 @-@ 9 ) struck 6 times in the 1 / 3 inn@@ ings and allowed three R@@ uns .
it was only his third successful start in his last nine games .
&quot; I want to end this year strongly , &quot; &quot; said Simon . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard to throw in the bull@@ pen each game , and therefore I want to go into the game very concentrated . &quot;
&quot; the designated tiger hit Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z had three hits and was in two races , his first R@@ BI@@ s since mid @-@ August . &quot;
it was the first three hit game by Mart@@ ine@@ z since he had four hits against the Seattle Marin@@ ers on July 6 .
&quot; he has sw@@ ung the but@@ ton@@ wood well , &quot; &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; he looked good at ( punch training ) , looked much better at the bull@@ pen , and he brought it straight into the game . &quot;
with three riders at the end of the seventh interior the T@@ wins had their best chance to get into the game again .
center Fiel@@ ds By@@ ron Bu@@ x@@ ton finished the inning with a double on the left field line .
right Fiel@@ der Aaron Hi@@ cks reached a Bun@@ t and Simon brought his second Bas@@ eman Brian Do@@ zier to the Stri@@ ke@@ out before being replaced by the left @-@ handed Bla@@ ine Har@@ dy .
&quot; Har@@ dy passed down the wall , the only man he was confronted with , in front of the designated R@@ ook@@ ie @-@ drummer Miguel S@@ ano , who entr@@ ust a Two @-@ Run to the right @-@ handed Dre@@ w Ver@@ hagen . &quot;
&quot; with a pair of runners and the finishing run at the second , Ver@@ hagen brought the third Bas@@ eman Tre@@ vor Pl@@ ou@@ ffe to a Double Play . &quot;
it was the 27th time in the Major League this season that Pl@@ ou@@ ffe suggested a Double Play
&quot; after he added a Insurance @-@ Run at the end of the ninth inning , wall created a R@@ BI double against the C@@ loser of the Tig@@ ers Bruce Ron@@ don and achieved the stand of 5 @-@ 4 . &quot;
&quot; however , the right @-@ handed person stab@@ bed S@@ ano with three Pit@@ ches for his fifth save . &quot;
Detroit acted as a pr@@ elu@@ de to the game from an even non moving Phil Hu@@ gh@@ es .
the tig@@ ers scored three riders in the first two inn@@ ings against the right @-@ handed veter@@ an who had been deleted from the injury list before the game after he was missing more than a month because of a back@@ bone .
&quot; obviously not the beginning I desired , &quot; said Hu@@ gh@@ es , &quot; but I felt more comfortable when I started and felt that I would create some pretty good Pit@@ ches there in the third inning . &quot;
&quot; after receiving the Le@@ ad@@ off Bat@@ ter , H@@ ushes gave a single to Second Bas@@ eman Ian Kin@@ sler . &quot;
a Two @-@ Out Walk for J.@@ D. Mart@@ ine@@ z brought Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z to play a single &quot; up the middle &quot; at the first run of the game .
Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z achieved his 0 @-@ 21 successful series with the Run@@ ners in the scor@@ ing position .
&quot; the third Bas@@ eman Nick Castell@@ anos followed with a single on the right side , managed another run , but Victor Mart@@ ine@@ z was thrown out of the game when he tried to get to the third , which ended the threat . &quot;
&quot; the Tig@@ ers laid in the second , achieved a One Out Double by Cat@@ cher James Mc@@ C@@ ann and a Two @-@ Out Single of Center @-@ Fiel@@ ds Anthony GO@@ SE to 3 @-@ 0 . &quot;
&quot; that was a big blow , &quot; &quot; said T@@ wins @-@ manager Paul Mol@@ itor . &quot;
&quot; he did not hit particularly well , but he caught the right place . &quot;
&quot; Hu@@ gh@@ es found himself in a pitch count , and scored no points in the third inning before being replaced by the rel@@ ic right @-@ handed A.@@ J.@@ A@@ chter . &quot;
at Hu@@ gh@@ es there were three R@@ uns with six hits and a walk with four kn@@ ap@@ outs .
remarks : Tig@@ ers R@@ HP Ani@@ bal San@@ che@@ z was eliminated because of an injury to the litter shoulder .
he is examined by Dr. James Andre@@ ws who operated the shoulder of San@@ che@@ z in 2007 .
&quot; San@@ che@@ z , since mid @-@ August on the vulner@@ ability list due to a shoulder distortion , is to be activated for the start on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; with San@@ che@@ z out of the game , L@@ HP Daniel Mor@@ ris is cancelled from the list of injuries to start against the T@@ wins . &quot;
Nor@@ ris with 1 @-@ 1 at four starts with the Tig@@ ers since he was acquired in exchange with L@@ HP David Price on July 30
he was missing on the right hip joint since 20 August .
the Tig@@ ers and the T@@ wins will end their series of three games in the Target Field on Wednesday
&quot; Nor@@ ris ( 2 @-@ 2,@@ 4,@@ 43 ER@@ A ) will play against Minn@@ es@@ ot@@ as R@@ HP Er@@ vin Sant@@ ana ( 5 @-@ 4 , 4.@@ 73 ) &quot;
hundreds of refugees to come down in Wiesbaden
a train with hundreds of refugees is on the way to H@@ esse .
his arrival was expected for the night on Wednesday .
&quot; the people who arrived in it should then be accommodated in emergency shel@@ ters in Wiesbaden , as the city of Wiesbaden submitted on Tuesday evening . &quot;
she reck@@ oned with 450 to 750 incoming refugees .
several sports halls of the Hessen State Capital have been prepared for this case over the past few days .
up to 1000 refugees can stay there temporarily .
they should then be distributed to other municipalities .
&quot; in the past ten days alone , 7@@ 500 people in H@@ esse have arrived in Hessen , according to the head of the government responsible for the initial up@@ take . &quot;
Frankfurt and Han@@ au have also established emergency shel@@ ters in sports halls because of the large number of refugees .
Isch@@ inger : German military measures in Syria an option
&quot; the head of the Munich Security Conference , Wolfgang Isch@@ inger , holds military measures with German involvement in Syria for an opportunity . &quot;
&quot; I think the decisive re@@ thinking about military action options must not take place without Germany , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; he proposed &quot; &quot; collective vision &quot; &quot; to the European states . &quot;
four years ago it was said that the ch@@ ali@@ ce of a military involvement in Germany passed .
&quot; now the conflict ends in front of our front door , &quot; he said in Deutschl@@ and@@ funk . &quot;
the former German ambassador in Washington also called for a massive increase in international aid to the refugees .
Austria controls southern and eastern borders
&quot; after Germany , Austria has again established controls on its southern and eastern borders . &quot;
&quot; Austrian Minister of the Interior , Joh@@ anna Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner , declared on Tuesday evening in the Austrian TV channel ORF , and no one will be returned to Hungary . &quot;
&quot; Germany , too , has returned no refugees to Austria . &quot;
&quot; no , that &apos;s how agreed , &quot; she explained . &quot;
&quot; on the question of an agreement which Germany could accommodate a certain number of refugees from Austria per day , Mik@@ l @-@ Leit@@ ner said that there have already been talks between the General Director for Public Security and representatives of Germany . &quot;
she did not call for concrete figures and pointed to talks on Wednesday in Berlin .
&quot; in the past few days , tens of thousands of refugees have come to Austria via the so @-@ called Balkan Route from Hungary . &quot;
their goal is mostly Germany .
Chancellor Angela Merkel ( CD@@ U ) and her Austrian colleague Werner F@@ ay@@ mann requested a special summit for next week with several other EU heads of state and government .
Germany had started with temporary border controls on Sunday .
the EU states have so far failed to agree on a common approach in the crisis .
&quot; on the next Tuesday ( 22 September ) , the EU interior ministers want to take a new start to the binding distribution of further 120@@ ,000 refugees at a special meeting . &quot;
&quot; in view of the strong refugee flow in Germany , the federal government wants to support countries more strongly in the initial up@@ take and distribution of people . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Government will manage this together with the countries , announced Merkel on the late Tuesday evening after almost four @-@ hour consultations with the Prime Minister in the Chanc@@ ellery in Berlin . &quot;
&quot; Merkel under@@ lined , those people who needed protection would also be@@ g it . &quot;
&quot; but if you don &apos;t have a lead , you can &apos;t stay in Germany either . &quot;
this conception was expressed in the round .
&quot; the chan@@ cell@@ or stressed that the state as a whole must now deal with a &quot; &quot; huge effort &quot; . &quot; &quot;
thousands of desperate refugees are now stuck on the Balkan Route .
Hungary closed its 175 @-@ kilometre @-@ long border to Serbia in the night of Tuesday .
&quot; a few hours later , the government announced in Budapest to tie the border to Romania with a fence . &quot;
this neighbour country is different from Serbia to the EU .
Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said : Hungary &apos;s Foreign Minister Peter S@@ zi@@ j@@ jar@@ to said to the planned new border fence .
the Romanian government promptly condemned the plan .
there were first ar@@ rests of people who had cut the fence .
&quot; according to e@@ ye@@ witness reports in Turkey , thousands more migrants were on the way to the Greek border . &quot;
space probe &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; finds ocean on Satur@@ n@@ mond En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us
under the ice @-@ p@@ anz@@ er of the Saturn @-@ moon En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us a global ocean flo@@ ats .
this includes researchers from the observations of the spac@@ ecraft &apos; Cass@@ ini &apos; .
&quot; therefore , the moon pl@@ ung@@ es easily on its orbit around the ring planets . &quot;
&quot; although this de@@ af@@ ting motion is only small , but still too large for a permanently fixed cel@@ esti@@ al body , it is said in a message from the Corn@@ ell University in I@@ th@@ aca ( US State of New York ) from Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; the researchers present their analyses in the &quot; &quot; I@@ car@@ us &quot; &quot; sheet . &quot;
it has been known for a long time that there must be liquid water under the ice cover of En@@ cel@@ ad@@ us .
&quot; thus &quot; Cass@@ ini &quot; had already discovered ice @-@ vul@@ can@@ es at the south pole of Saturn &apos;s moon in 2006 , sp@@ it the water vap@@ or and ice particles and thus feed the so @-@ called E @-@ Ring of Saturn . &quot;
&quot; at least at the south pole , there must be a underground sea , the astronom@@ ers closed then . &quot;
&quot; however , the expansion of the hidden ocean was not clear . &quot;
R@@ ama missing in Munich in 1860 for several weeks
&quot; in 1860 , around one month , Val@@ det R@@ ama has to abandon Val@@ det R@@ ama . &quot;
the association with the 27 @-@ year @-@ old gave an inquiry into the association .
R@@ ama compla@@ ined about pain at the start of the week .
&quot; according to the &quot; &quot; Münchner Lion &quot; , &quot; the diagnosis is expected to be four weeks of forced break . &quot;
&quot; it &apos;s hard for us , R@@ ama is a bitter loss . &quot;
&quot; of course , we have to think about it now , &quot; said Sports Director N@@ ec@@ at Ay@@ gü@@ n in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper with a view of the potential commitment of a united professionals . &quot;
&quot; as a training guest , the six@@ ties first presented a defensive person . &quot;
the 30 @-@ year @-@ old Hr@@ vo@@ je C@@ ale was last active in Belgium and was already under contract at the V@@ f@@ L Wolfs@@ burg .
&quot; at present , the Cro@@ at has &quot; the opportunity to prove his skill . &quot; &quot;
&quot; after his bra@@ ins , Tor@@ j@@ äger Rub@@ in Ok@@ ot@@ ie can return to the team training again next week . &quot;
&quot; already on Thursday , the Austrian national player is supposed to jump into the running training . &quot;
&quot; in the game at Fort@@ una Düsseldorf ( 0 : 3 ) , Ok@@ ot@@ ie was injured in a violent collision at the head . &quot;
&quot; contrary to the first fears , however , he remained without a serious clas@@ h . &quot;
no diet fruit - Man@@ gos contain lots of sugar
man@@ gos are exotic and ju@@ icy @-@ sweet .
&quot; but if you want to pay attention to its slim line , it is often rather dis@@ cour@@ aged by them . &quot;
because Man@@ gos contain relatively high sugar - above all su@@ c@@ rose .
&quot; the exotic fruits are still healthy : in them , B vitamins , as well as vitamins E and C. In particular , man@@ goes contain a lot of vitamin A and its prec@@ ursor beta carot@@ ene . &quot;
&quot; those who eat the fruits thus support sight , immune system and metabolic processes in the body . &quot;
&quot; when buying , man@@ gos should not be too soft or too firm and pleasant smell . &quot;
the peel color alone says nothing about how ripe the fruit is - so also green man@@ gos can taste delicious .
they should be stored at room temperature and consumed within a few days .
&quot; then , of course , they taste pure or in sweet foods . &quot;
a man@@ go also gives sa@@ vory dishes a special touch .
it allevi@@ ates the slightly bitter taste of some leaf salads such as Chi@@ cor@@ tea and Ra@@ dic@@ cio .
&quot; and a Man@@ go@@ ch@@ ut@@ ney fits well to fish , poultry , lamb and ven@@ ison . &quot;
the US parcel service U@@ PS supplies up to 9@@ 5000 hel@@ pers for the Christmas business in the USA .
&quot; the company has already started the recruitment of seasonal workers , U@@ PS distributed on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; above all , drivers are sought . &quot;
&quot; already last year , U@@ PS raised its workforce for the holiday season by 9@@ 5000 hel@@ pers . &quot;
&quot; in view of the bo@@ oming online business , U@@ PS and its competitor F@@ ed@@ Ex have been taking precau@@ tions since last year to be prepared for the Christmas business . &quot;
&quot; in 2013 , delayed deliveries had brought harsh criticism to the package services . &quot;
&quot; first blow @-@ storm , then striking cold front &quot;
&quot; in the coming night , in the valleys of the Alps side of the F@@ öhn winds through , as Met@@ e@@ o@@ Schweiz reported on Tuesday . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday and in the night to Thursday , the fo@@ eh@@ n sometimes blows with storm strength through the herd si@@ res . &quot;
&quot; after the end of Thursday morning we cross a striking cold front , which brings heavy rainf@@ alls , wind bu@@ cks and a decrease in temperature . &quot;
&quot; as Met@@ e@@ o@@ News writes in a message , Switzerland is currently on the front of an extensive low @-@ pressure area on the British Is@@ les in a powerful southwest current . &quot;
&quot; on the side of the Alps , during the night to the Wednesday of the F@@ öhn winds through the valleys . &quot;
&quot; as a result , the blow @-@ off blows from 60 to 100 km / h in the usual valleys with bends of 60 to 100 km / h , partly in the Ur@@ i region , partly also with more than 100 km / h . &quot;
&quot; the F@@ öhn is able to penetrate into the adjacent middle ground , and on the mountains even or@@ can@@ arches of over 120 km / h are possible . &quot;
&quot; while in the north on Wednesday stor@@ my hair dryer for summer temperatures of 23 to 27 degrees , the humidity begins to st@@ ow at the alpine slope . &quot;
here is the rain that lasts until Thursday evening .
&quot; in total , in the next 48 hours in the next 48 hours , some more than 100 litres of rain per square meter have to be accounted for , this has already occurred in the past few days . &quot;
&quot; on Thursday morning the blow opens up the air , as a result , a cold front rolls with strong , partly clou@@ dy rain from west to east over Switzerland . &quot;
&quot; together with the cold front , the wind blows strongly up to stor@@ my , and temperatures go down significantly . &quot;
&quot; the following days present themselves in the north with 15 to 20 degrees , in the south on the other hand it is sunny and warmer with up to 25 degrees in the south . &quot;
Rome now has a Martin Luther place
&quot; almost 500 years after the Reformation , there is now a Martin Luther place in Rome . &quot;
&quot; in the presence of President Ign@@ azi@@ o Marino , a hitherto nam@@ eless place in the park on the O@@ pp@@ io Hill was chri@@ sten@@ ed on the name of the German Re@@ former . &quot;
at the &quot; Piazza Martin Lu@@ ter@@ o &quot; he is now honoured as a &quot; German the@@ ologi@@ an of the Reformation . &quot;
the park is located in the middle of the old Rome next to the Col@@ os@@ se@@ um .
the nam@@ ing was filed by the Working Group of the Evangel@@ ical Churches in Rome .
&quot; Jens @-@ Martin Kr@@ use , pastor of the Evangel@@ ical Lutheran Church in Rome , reminded on Wednesday that Protest@@ ants in the city of Pop@@ es were often only able to live their faith in the city of Pop@@ es for centuries . &quot;
&quot; in a symbolic way , the place becomes visible in a symbolic way that its tradition of Christian faith is welcome in Rome . &quot;
Martin Luther ( 14@@ 83 @-@ 15@@ 46 ) considered himself a young August@@ ine mon@@ k about the turn of the year 15@@ 10 / 11 a few months in Rome .
he felt the city back then as a welcome sc@@ ap@@ ego@@ at .
his negative impressions are likely to have strengthened him in his later fight against Rome .
Luther then initiated the division of the oc@@ ci@@ dental church with his thes@@ es against the ab@@ rupt trade .
hammer artist invested three years in the personal interpretation of the Bible
Jesus with the ( gold @-@ plated ) Dor@@ nen@@ kr@@ one is one of the main works that Ot@@ mar Alt painted for his Bible .
Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost has written the introduction and updated Bible texts .
in the beginning was the Word ?
&quot; no , not at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Bible , which has now been published with splendid pictures . &quot;
&quot; at the beginning was the picture for Ot@@ mar Alt , who formulated in 150 motifs his very personal interpretations of biblical stories on paper and canvas . &quot;
&quot; the 75 @-@ year @-@ old has received his &quot; &quot; language &quot; &quot; with colorful colors and imagin@@ ative forms - but which is by no means syn@@ onymous with &quot; funny &quot; images . &quot;
&quot; on the contrary : adapted to the respective themes , it can be quite ble@@ ak . &quot;
&quot; about three years , Ot@@ mar Alt has worked on his Bible project for which he has made a subjective and artistic selection from the many subject areas of the &quot; book of all books . &quot; &quot;
&quot; cycles , which focus on topics such as cross@@ roads , pla@@ gues , bi@@ ds , and pat@@ ernity . &quot;
&quot; this has fascinated several partners spontaneously : this applies to Luther &apos;s publishing house with its the@@ ological orientation , as well as for the Kettler publishing house with its emphasis on art books . &quot;
&quot; and there is , above all , the author Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost , who has dealt with the biblical passages on the basis of painting . &quot;
&quot; he interpreted the biblical passages , chosen by Ot@@ mar Alt , and translated into present @-@ day connections . &quot;
these texts are like verbal mirrors of Al@@ ts painting .
they are embedded between the original Bible quotation of Martin Luther and a set of the artist who formulated his very personal thoughts on the respective situation .
the jewelry cord has golden letters .
&quot; thus , the 75 @-@ year @-@ old gives twice a deep insight into his soul , his emotions . &quot;
this is a high level of in@@ timacy .
&quot; emotions were ultimately triggered at all for the Bible project : Ot@@ mar Alt , born in Wer@@ ni@@ ger@@ ode in 1940 and grew up in Berlin , comes from a family belonging to the strict Protestant Master of Gl@@ ory . &quot;
&quot; the up@@ bringing took place already with the cane , &quot; re@@ members Ot@@ mar Alt . &quot;
&quot; I tried to work it up , perhaps to re@@ pay me with the Lord &apos;s father . &quot;
&quot; his second aim is to restore art in a fast @-@ lived manner : &quot; the perception of pic@@ torial worlds is today marked by advertising , and it is loud . &quot;
symbol@@ ism is being displaced .
artists have a different pleasure and pleasure to show things .
pictures always have something secret and are not decorative .
&quot; in this respect , I am a din@@ osau@@ r . &quot;
&quot; Ot@@ mar Alt wants to let the viewer fall into the pictures , let them work , discover and feel what power they have : &quot; the image is looking for its counterpart . &quot;
&quot; on Tuesday , Klaus Alt@@ ep@@ ost was a lover of Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts &apos;s art at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation &apos;s presentation at the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Foundation , &quot; I like how he understands life with his paintings . &quot;
&quot; I have not taken care of fully compreh@@ ending the Bible , but also choosing the most important , mysterious subjects . &quot;
&quot; this was not a collaboration on eye level , &quot; says Alt@@ ep@@ ost : &quot; here it is about the pictures , the text merely explains . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for Hans M@@ öh@@ ler from Luther @-@ Verlag , this work is an invitation to &quot; deep@@ en his life and to find freedom . &quot; &quot;
Ot@@ mar Al@@ ts pictures speak for M@@ öh@@ ler both the ( biblical ) language of love as well as those of responsibility .
&quot; a part of the original - paper and linen pictures - will be presented for the first time in an exhibition , which will be opened in the Ot@@ mar @-@ Alt @-@ Stiftung on November 15th . &quot;
start of construction for BM@@ X @-@ Bahn
&quot; plans made , place found , company assigned , earth hill for a round course model@@ ed : one year later almost everything was finished - but before the official opening of the BM@@ X railway it was already finished . &quot;
&quot; in terms of policy and administration , failures , especially for residents who did not want to tolerate the railway . &quot;
&quot; so hills deposited , new place looked for - now with formal planning and application for building permission . &quot;
&quot; the approval will be made in October , the first church leader Sabine Mos@@ eb@@ ach @-@ Bo@@ ck could now communicate in the children &apos;s and youth committee . &quot;
&quot; I hope this year will happen , &quot; she said . &quot;
&quot; it should then begin with the work at the former indoor pool without &quot; &quot; further memorial break &quot; . &quot; &quot;
DF@@ B intensi@@ fies engagement for refugees
&quot; the DF@@ B extends its commitment to refugees by 2019 , the Bundes@@ liga takes a clear signal on the weekend . &quot;
the football re@@ acts to the p@@ onder@@ ing situation in Germany and sec@@ ures its help in tac@@ kling the upcoming problems .
&quot; I think this is the biggest challenge of our country since re@@ unification . &quot;
&quot; no one can say in principle , that doesn &apos;t concern me , I don &apos;t have anything to do with it . &quot;
&quot; this must be of interest to everyone to get a grip on this topic , &quot; said DF@@ B chief Wolfgang Ni@@ ers@@ bach . &quot;
&quot; at the annual meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on 23 September in Berlin , he plans to discuss the refugee situation in Germany intensively . &quot;
&quot; I am next Wednesday at the Chanc@@ ellery and meet the Minister of State , Ms Ö@@ zo@@ ğ@@ u@@ z and the chan@@ cell@@ or . &quot;
&quot; the subject will certainly play a central role , &quot; he announced . &quot;
football could and wants to help .
but the decisive turn@@ outs must pose the policy .
the German Football Association has therefore extended its refugee initiative &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; four years ago .
&quot; through the E@@ gi@@ di@@ us Braun Stiftung , we have ensured that this program continues until 2019 , &quot; explained Ni@@ ers@@ bach at the edge of the UEF@@ A meeting in St. Julian &apos;s / Malta . &quot;
some federal li@@ gi@@ sts also support this program .
&quot; this weekend , the 36 professionals will be presenting a clear sign if they will be entitled &quot; &quot; We help - # Refu@@ ge@@ es@@ Welcome &quot; &quot; instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) , instead of the usual sponsor logos ( Her@@ mes ) . &quot;
&quot; we also want to make it clear that everyone should help where and how they can , &quot; said Le@@ verk@@ usen Sports Director Ru@@ di Völ@@ ler in the &quot; Bild &quot; newspaper ( Tuesday ) and described the project as &quot; self @-@ evident . &quot; &quot;
&quot; the drama of refugees goes every one , nobody is allowed to leave . &quot;
&quot; &quot; &quot; we football fans can , no , we have to use our bril@@ liance , our influence and our possibilities to help the many refugees that have suffered so incredibly , &quot; &quot; said Her@@ tha @-@ Manager Michael Pre@@ etz . &quot;
H@@ offen@@ heim &apos;s Managing Director Peter Ret@@ tig spoke of a &quot; prominent sign of the League . &quot;
&quot; on this Friday , the national team of women invites 100 refugees to Halle / Sa@@ ale . &quot;
Ni@@ ers@@ bach described the support of refugees as &quot; a large communal work of German football . &quot;
that all 36 licensing agreements in their places started their own projects is great .
just as great is that small and smallest clubs are active .
the message &quot; 1 : 0 for a welcome &quot; we spent will live in football .
&quot; this is of enormous importance , &quot; &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; in this and next year , the association together with the German Federal Government will provide 300 000 Euro for the integration of refugees . &quot;
&quot; the clubs have already called the whole sum for 2015 , &quot; Ni@@ ers@@ bach reported . &quot;
reports : head of the Executive Board loses an eye on accident
&quot; according to several reports , the Board of Directors of Europe &apos;s largest software company , Bill Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t , lost the left eye due to a fall in early July . &quot;
&quot; during the accident on the stairs in his brother &apos;s house in the USA , he fell on a water glass after midnight , which he wore in his left hand , reports the &quot; Wirtschafts@@ Woche &quot; on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; he is almost thorou@@ gh@@ bred , was power@@ less , then dra@@ gged out of the road - that &apos;s what he told us last week , &quot; quoted the &quot; Wi@@ Wo &quot; SAP co @-@ founder Has@@ so Platt@@ ner . &quot;
Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t can do his job .
&quot; at the beginning of October we meet at the Supervisory Board meeting in Wall@@ dorf , &quot; &quot; said Platt@@ ner . &quot;
the 54 @-@ year @-@ old manager was at the meeting and &quot; fully working . &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t announced in an interview with the &quot; Süd@@ deutsche Zeitung &quot; ( Thursday edition ) , he will come back to Germany in October and will continue to lead the software company . &quot;
&quot; I am full for SAP , full in my job . &quot;
&quot; of course , I was in regular contact with the Supervisory Board and its chairman Has@@ so Platt@@ ner all the time , &quot; said Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t of the &quot; S@@ Z . &quot; &quot;
&quot; Mc@@ Der@@ mot@@ t usually comm@@ utes between Germany and the US , but since summer he was no longer in the German SAP headquarters in Wall@@ dorf . &quot;
&quot; it is important to him to go public with such a personal history , the manager of the &quot; S@@ Z &quot; said : &quot; everyone can happen this way . &quot;
it is important to rise up once you &apos;ve fallen down .
Mc@@ L@@ aren @-@ replacement pilot Magn@@ us@@ sen out of battle ...

soccer : Bv@@ B with no R@@ eus against Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar : Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller in the gate
at Bor@@ ussi@@ a Dortmund all hopes for a com@@ eback from Marco R@@ eus in the first group game of the Europa League have finally sm@@ ashed .
the national player will also be missing the championship leader of the Bundes@@ liga in du@@ el with the F@@ K Kr@@ as@@ no@@ dar Thursday ( 19@@ .00 o &apos;clock / Sky ) .
&quot; unfortunately , we cannot resort to him , &quot; said Thomas Tu@@ chel on Wednesday . &quot;
&quot; whether R@@ eus will be back on Sunday in the Bundes@@ liga match against Le@@ verk@@ usen , the BV@@ B coach left open : &quot; we expect a return from him to the training on Friday . &quot;
&quot; in view of the high load of its professionals , Tu@@ ck@@ les will not only change its trunk to the R@@ eus position . &quot;
so he announced a change on the door of the door .
&quot; therefore , Roman Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller takes the place of master @-@ keeper Roman bür@@ ki . &quot;
&quot; he trains at an absolute top level , &quot; the football instructor praised the world champion . &quot;
&quot; however , whether Wei@@ den@@ f@@ eller will be used in all Europe league games , Tu@@ ck@@ les left open . &quot;
&quot; with a high probability , he will also contest the second game . &quot;
&quot; the for@@ er@@ un@@ ner statement of fellow players R@@ eus , that the final entry for the BV@@ B in the Europa League needs to be the goal , holds mid@@ fiel@@ der Julian Wei@@ gl for trac@@ eable : &quot; that &apos;s why Marco is not so wrong . &quot;
I think we have a good chance to pick up the title .
Rob@@ ots : government wants to play leadership role for Germany
&quot; according to the German government &apos;s will , Germany should be a technological pioneer when it comes to the change of the car . &quot;
&quot; the Federal Cab@@ inet decided on Wednesday a strategy paper from the House of Transport Minister Alexander Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t ( CS@@ U ) , which , among other things , envis@@ ages investments in the expansion of digital infrastructure . &quot;
&quot; on Wednesday at the Frankfurt Motor Show , Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t spoke about a &quot; new mobility era . &quot; &quot;
&quot; automated and connected driving will increase traffic safety and ensure less traffic jams , &quot; said Do@@ br@@ ind@@ t . &quot;
he also wants to discuss the subject with his colleagues from the G@@ 7 countries which come together with representatives of industry at the International Motor Show .
&quot; among other things , the Ministry of Transport &apos;s strategy paper emphas@@ ises the importance of mobile broad@@ band expansion and a rapid increase in digital radio communication . &quot;
&quot; currently , testing of new technology results in a test track on the motorway 9 in Bavaria . &quot;
&quot; in order for the driver to &quot; &quot; avoid additional liability risks , &quot; &quot; the Federal Government wants to verify the legal framework and , where necessary , adapt to the new developments . &quot;
&quot; for example , Germany wants to use the permissible maximum speed for self @-@ prop@@ elled cars from 10 to 130 km / h . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the federal government wants to advocate a change in the Vienna Convention , which until now only sees the human being as a driver . &quot;
&quot; in automated driving , the car takes over the lead , the driver becomes more and more to the passenger . &quot;
the technology is based primarily on sensors and cameras that capture the environment and process data in seconds .
&quot; according to a study published by the Ministry of Economy , highly automated driving on motor@@ ways can be technically possible by 2020 . &quot;
&quot; however , road@@ worth@@ less vehicles on public roads are expected to be expected only far after 2020 . &quot;
the value added in the driver assistance systems and highly automated driving functions in Germany estimate the authors of the study for 20@@ 25 to around 8.@@ 4 billion euros .
&quot; the digital networking of cars can lead to increased safety and efficiency in road traffic , &quot; &quot; said SPD transport politi@@ cian S@@ ören Bar@@ to@@ l . &quot;
&quot; however , the question of liability in accidents and the safety of the personal data of the drivers must be clearly clari@@ fied . &quot;
&quot; however , the Germans still see self @-@ prop@@ elled cars skep@@ tical - much more than French or Americans . &quot;
&quot; a survey by the For@@ sa Institute , presented on Wednesday at the AA &apos;s AA , comes to the conclusion that only eight percent of Germans believe that autonomous driving cars will prevail over the next ten years , 32 percent believe that 31 percent do not believe in it at all . &quot;
&quot; * Use five @-@ year forecasts to assess how the market is predicted to develop . Euro@@ monitor International has over 40 years &apos; experience of publishing market research reports , business reference books and online information systems . &quot;
&quot; anyway , drivers in Germany are not ready to rely completely on a self @-@ prop@@ elled vehicle . &quot;
&quot; according to a survey of the Digital Union Bit@@ kom , only seven percent would agree to give control over the entire journey on all roads . &quot;
&quot; at the same time , in the course of flowing traffic , at least 15 percent could imagine on the motorway , in the traffic jam 45 percent . &quot;
well each fourth would not leave the car in control under any circumstances .
Bol@@ l says team and double start at table tennis @-@ EM
&quot; according to current state , the Dus@@ sel@@ dorf will only be able to beat the title fight for the title fight from September 25 to October 4 . &quot;
the final decision shall be made at the latest on 22 September .
&quot; this is a huge loss for our team . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the guys experienced it in the morning . &quot;
&quot; but we are strong enough to get the title even without Timo , &quot; said Bun@@ de@@ trainer Jörg Ro@@ ß@@ kopf during the European Championship in Düsseldorf . &quot;
&quot; at this point , Bol@@ l was on the flight to a scheduled sponsor appointment in China on a long @-@ term basis . &quot;
the 34 year old German champion is expected to return on Friday .
&quot; without Timo the down@@ side , we are no longer such a clear favorite , &quot; &quot; said Single European Champion Dimit@@ ri@@ j Ov@@ t@@ bat@@ ov . &quot;
&quot; the Ham@@ el@@ ner , who leads the S@@ etz@@ alten@@ list in Y@@ ek@@ ater@@ in@@ burg , also reminded the Euro 2013 in Sch@@ wech@@ at . &quot;
&quot; at that time Timo lack@@ ed , and we became the European champion . &quot;
&quot; we should ori@@ ent ourselves to it , &quot; declared the Fi@@ fth @-@ Fi@@ fth . &quot;

Gau@@ l@@ tier feels too old for an En@@ f@@ ant terrible
it is a mixture of very big fashion show and a wax figures gr@@ us@@ el@@ kab@@ in@@ ett : the designer Jean Paul Gau@@ l@@ tier ( 63 ) presented an exhibition about his work on Wednesday in Munich .
the highlights : mannequins which look terri@@ bly human thanks to video projections .
&quot; they wear the spectacular creations of the French designer , who , among other things , became the big star of the fashion scene with Mad@@ onn@@ as &apos;s stage out@@ fits - and that he put men in skir@@ ts . &quot;
&quot; today , I can no longer say that I am the En@@ f@@ ant terrible of Haute Cou@@ ture because I have white hair . &quot;
&quot; it used to be ble@@ ached , now it &apos;s real , &quot; &quot; said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
&quot; for the visitors of the exhibition &quot; From The Side@@ walk To The Cat@@ walk &quot; ( From the side@@ walk to the cat@@ walk ) , which can be seen from the 18th of September at the Kunsth@@ alle der Hyp@@ o @-@ Kultur@@ stiftung , it is a good fortune that the designer has changed his attitude towards a show about his person at the beginning . &quot;
&quot; he was actually against it , because : &quot; for me , an exhibition sounded a bit after death , &quot; he said . &quot;
&quot; when one dies , one gets into the museum . &quot;
the impressive collection had previously been made in Montreal and Paris .
&quot; it &apos;s about so much more than just beautiful clothes , &quot; said the director of the Kunsth@@ alle , Roger Di@@ e@@ das . &quot;
&quot; it is about tolerance , acceptance and the vision of an open society . &quot;
the exhibits give an insight into the hardly ever @-@ looking work of the man who has written fashion history without ever having completed an apprenticeship .
&quot; chron@@ ologically the show is not built up , but it is an excell@@ ently chore@@ ograph@@ ed overall artwork , for which a lot of effort was spent : to au@@ gment the dolls , for example , a sty@@ list was hired . &quot;
&quot; according to the cur@@ ator Thierry @-@ Maxim@@ e L@@ ori@@ ot , the makers have made 14 tonnes of material . &quot;
shortly before the start of the Oktober@@ fest there was a special delic@@ acy : a leather@@ cord outfit with cor@@ set .
Hei@@ di meets Madonna .
&quot; he has always been interested in strong women ( &quot; &quot; Women are smar@@ ter than men &quot; &quot; ) and for people who are a little different , Gau@@ l@@ tier said . &quot;
also Gau@@ l@@ tier &apos;s old Ted@@ dy can be seen in the exhibition .
&quot; he stands for the first , agile fashion design of the designer . &quot;
&quot; as a child ( he wasn &apos;t a good student and bad in football ) , he wore his Ted@@ dy B@@ H@@ s and dresses , said Gau@@ l@@ tier . &quot;
playing with a doll would not have allowed his parents to play him .
he later taught the design of fashion himself .
he st@@ ole fashion magazines and saw the designs of other designers as Gau@@ l@@ tier told in Munich .
but later I bought them .
he couldn &apos;t pay the models for his first fashion show .
&quot; they got nothing , but were allowed to keep the clothes . &quot;
jewellery instead of Gar@@ dine - P@@ lau@@ dry tip as a fashion niche
&quot; in the past , the long embroi@@ der@@ ies in and around P@@ lau@@ en were about to make meters . &quot;
&quot; the embroi@@ dered materials and tips were created in large quantities for customers , which , for example , processed ceilings and she@@ ers . &quot;
&quot; today this is no longer functioning today , &quot; explains Andreas Rein@@ hardt , managing director of the P@@ lau@@ en . &quot;
&quot; instead , fashion is again important . &quot;
&quot; in the early times of the P@@ lau@@ ener lace fashion , fashion played a major role , and was then displaced by the Heim@@ tex@@ til industry - and is now re@@ discovered as niche . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt called some examples : lace in jewelry , in accessories like bags and with regional costumes . &quot;
&quot; at all , the so @-@ called vintage fashion , which leans toward past styl@@ istic eras , is an increasing customer potential . &quot;
those who don &apos;t use niche in the textile industry in Germany are no longer on the market .
&quot; with us , they already account for half of all orders . &quot;
&quot; in cooperation with nine other companies , P@@ lau@@ en is a member of the P@@ lau@@ en lace and embroi@@ dery industry association . &quot;
only they must bear the protected label .
&quot; in the past 15 years , around 80 percent of sales have been broken away . &quot;
there are almost no private trade deals and wholesale trade .
our products hardly reach the customer in this way .
&quot; nowadays , mass goods are produced much cheaper in the Asian region and sold almost exclusively via chains . &quot;
&quot; in addition , exports weak@@ en , current to Russia and the USA . &quot;
so enough reasons for new ways .
&quot; the industry association also attempts to score points on environmental awareness , as C@@ ord@@ ula Bauer explains about the embroi@@ dery in Fal@@ k@@ enstein : &quot; &quot; this year we have been leading a quality seal that shows that we produce environmentally and socially compatible . &quot;
&quot; Rein@@ hardt adds : &quot; &quot; this also applies to the materials used . &quot;
diploma designer U@@ te Schmidt is teaching at the Schne@@ e@@ berg branch office at the University of Applied Sciences Z@@ wick@@ au - at the Faculty of Applied Arts - and is specialized in embroi@@ dery and lace .
&quot; in order to counter@@ act competition from the Asian region , one has to find high @-@ quality and innovative products . &quot;
it takes time and courage .
&quot; it creates a field of tension between the fresh@@ est ideas of designers and companies that have to think of everything economically , &quot; says Schmidt . &quot;
&quot; therefore , an existing design is often only slightly varied in order to maintain a customer base . &quot;
&quot; a few years ago , textile designer Kat@@ i Reu@@ ter rev@@ ital@@ ised the historic snow@@ ball point . &quot;
&quot; in doing so , the machine sti@@ cking small spheres in some places . &quot;
&quot; the P@@ lau@@ ener gold@@ smith &apos;s master@@ y Bianca H@@ alle@@ bach @-@ K@@ rau@@ ße took inspiration from it : &quot; &quot; before that , I could not start anything with traditional P@@ lau@@ ener lace . &quot;
now she uses the snow ball for her jewelry .
&quot; in a complex process , it shapes the pattern in silver . &quot;
&quot; many people in the region identify with the topic of P@@ lau@@ ener &apos;s tip - young and old , &quot; says Reu@@ ter . &quot;
&quot; it also supplies to the USA , to Australia and to Finland , mainly to customers whose ancestors lived in P@@ lau@@ en and surroundings and who wish to have a memory . &quot;
with this I see my jewellery as a modern ambassador of the P@@ lau@@ ener Spitze .
Disney plans new &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins &quot; movie
&quot; legends are not to be touched , but Disney still vent@@ ures to a new film of his classic &quot; Mary P@@ opp@@ ins . &quot; &quot;
&quot; according to &quot; Entertainment Week@@ ly , &quot; however , it &apos;s not about a new movie , but a kind of sequ@@ el that takes place 20 years after the first film with the magical girl girl . &quot;
it is about the experience of N@@ anny with the family B@@ anks in times of the world economic crisis in England .
who plays P@@ opp@@ ins more than 50 years after Ju@@ lie Andre@@ ws is still unclear .
&quot; but the director is already fixed : Ro@@ b Marshall , most recently with &quot; In@@ to the W@@ oods &quot; in the cinema . &quot;
XI ur@@ ges to open the economy more broad@@ ly for the world
&quot; the economy must open wide out@@ wards to promote growth , President Xi Jin@@ ping said on Tuesday of a group that was charged with the steering of reform . &quot;
&quot; China should endeav@@ our to attract foreign investment and know @-@ how and improve the strategy for business start @-@ ups , &quot; he said in a speech at the 16th session of the Central Leadership Group for the deep@@ ening of a comprehensive reform . &quot;
&quot; promoting new start @-@ ups and driving forward reforms will bring about new momentum and vitality and provide new space for economic growth , &quot; &quot; said Xi . &quot;
&quot; the Leadership Group has adopted a series of guidelines , including a negative list on the regulation of market access , relaxation of border controls policies , promotion of state enterprises ( SO@@ E ) , private capital , and over@@ haul of the inhabitants reporting system . &quot;
&quot; after the statement , a negative list is created that identifies sectors and companies that are not eligible for investment . &quot;
the system is gradually being tested and improved by test programs .
&quot; the initiative is of great importance as it has a major role in the allocation of resources to the market , guaranteeing a right @-@ wing business environment and making the market more open , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
the government will also l@@ ure inspections of the powers transferred to the company and make sure that companies decide how to conduct their business .
the statement also said that China will allow border areas to explore new models of cross @-@ border economic cooperation and new mechanisms to promote regional growth .
&quot; as part of an offer to open state @-@ controlled sectors , further areas are opened for private investment . &quot;
&quot; the government will not change its policy vis @-@ à @-@ vis foreign investments and will protect the legitimate interests of foreign @-@ funded companies and provide better services for them , &quot; &quot; said the statement . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it is easier for foreigners to apply for a permanent residence permit or &quot; &quot; Green Card &quot; &quot; by optim@@ ising the requirements and facilit@@ ating the application process . &quot;
&quot; to guarantee the right of the lawyers to exercise their activity , and to employ professional judges and prosec@@ ut@@ ors , was also discussed at a meeting . &quot;
&quot; at the meeting , Prime Minister Li Ke@@ q@@ i@@ ang and important leaders such as Li@@ u Y@@ un@@ sh@@ an and Z@@ hang Ga@@ oli participated , as announced in a statement published after the meeting . &quot;
EU wants to double mercury limit in predat@@ ory fish
the European Commission wants to double the limit values for mercury in large predat@@ ory fish and thus exploit the consumer a much higher dose of the pesti@@ cide .
&quot; the consumer organisation F@@ ood@@ watch , who is presenting a corresponding working paper of the EU , sharply critici@@ zed the plans : &quot; &quot; risks and side effects inf@@ alli@@ ble industrial and environmental policy are passed on with full force of pregnant and small children , &quot; &quot; explained Matthias Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t of F@@ ood@@ watch . &quot;
&quot; according to Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t , the limit values of the nerve agent for large fish at the end of the food chain , such as shar@@ k or s@@ wor@@ d@@ fish , are to be raised from one to two milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram of fish . &quot;
&quot; large predat@@ ory fish , however , are already so heavily loaded with mercury , that around 50 per cent of catches are not allowed to be sold on the basis of the still valid limit values . &quot;
&quot; after dou@@ bling the limit values , only 14.@@ 5 percent would be un@@ market@@ able . &quot;
&quot; according to F@@ ood@@ watch , in return for this e@@ asing , the EU wants to tigh@@ ten the limit values for other fish from currently 0.5 milli@@ grams to 0.1 milli@@ grams of mercury per kil@@ ogram . &quot;
&quot; but F@@ ood@@ watch called this as &quot; &quot; trick &quot; , &quot; because smaller Fried@@ fishes , such as car@@ p usually are so heavily loaded , that they already comply with the planned maximum values today . &quot;
&quot; the lowering of Kl@@ einf@@ o is therefore a per@@ fi@@ de distra@@ ction that helps the economy alone , &quot; explained Wolf@@ sch@@ mid@@ t . &quot;
mercury is a heavy metal that is highly toxic to humans that accumulate over the food chain especially in predat@@ ory fish .
&quot; the Federal Government therefore warns against &quot; &quot; already small amounts of particularly in the case of un@@ born damage to the nervous system . &quot; &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Federal Environment Ministry declares on its homepage with regard to the applicable maximum values , however , that a &quot; health hazard to the general population &quot; is not to be expected . &quot;
mercury is mainly caused by the carbon combustion in the environment .
&quot; according to a written information from the German Federal Environment Ministry , the German coal @-@ fired power stations comply with more than six tonnes of mercury in the year , two thirds of the total amount em@@ itted in Germany . &quot;
&quot; the concentration of mercury in fish such as in Elbe , Rhine and Danube was &quot; permanently and nationwide , &quot; the &quot; Spiegel &quot; had quoted out of paper in March . &quot;
&quot; last year , Europe @-@ wide warnings of mercury in fish were already among the most frequently reported health risks in the EU warning system RA@@ S@@ FF . &quot;
