&quot; according to the organization , the organization publishes the distribution of core material from the states , subject to the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the provisions of this Convention shall be concluded with regard to core material , as soon as the recipient state , as envis@@ aged in this Convention , has taken over responsibility . &quot;
&quot; the organisation carries out documents , from which any disclosure and , if necessary , the re@@ use of the securing measures to the given core material . &quot;
&quot; in the event of non @-@ nuclear activities , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , nuclear material shall be used , such as the manufacture of alloys or ceramics , so the association will agree with the organization of such use of the material under which circumstances the securing measures can be termin@@ ated in relation to this material . &quot;
II ) that the material is not used for the production of nuclear weapons and other kern@@ els during the non @-@ application of the f@@ use actions after this Convention .
B ) The organisation and the community make arrangements to ensure that the securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are not applied only as long as the core material is used for such activity .
&quot; as far as possible , the scheme will determine how long and under what circumstances these securing measures will not be applied . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the securing measures envis@@ aged in this agreement will be applied once again as soon as the core material is returned to a peaceful nuclear activity . &quot;
the organization is kept on the ongoing basis of the total quantity and the composition of this material in the respective state or the respective states and on any passing on such material from this state or these states .
&quot; this explains their agreement as swi@@ f@@ tly as possible ; it only covers matters such as temporal and proced@@ ural determin@@ ations and agreements for reporting , but does not include a endor@@ sement or an insi@@ der knowledge of military action and does not refer to the subsequent use of the core material . &quot;
&quot; the organization , the community and the states bear the costs that each of them grow in the implementation of their respective obligations under this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the community , states or individuals who are subject to their territorial authority , but extraordinary costs as a result of a special request of the organization , the organisation reimbur@@ ses these costs as long as it has been clari@@ fied beforehand . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the organization bears the costs of all additional measurements and sampling , which are demanded by the inspec@@ tors of the organisation . &quot;
&quot; the Community and States ensure that the liability of liability for nuclear damages , including insurance or other financial security which may be used in accordance with its laws and other provisions , shall be applied to the organization and its officials for the purposes of carrying out this Convention in the same manner as for the nation@@ als of the states . &quot;
any claim that the commun@@ ion or the state against the organization or the organization in relation to the commun@@ ion or a state for damages - with the exception of damages arising from a nuclear incident - shall be enforced in accordance with international law .
&quot; in order to verify the relevant information provided by the General Director , the Council is unable to verify that no core material , which must be subject to hed@@ ging measures , must reimbur@@ se the reports provided in Article X@@ II ( C ) and may also take the other measures envis@@ aged there . &quot;
&quot; in such steps , the Council , in which weight has been obtained by the applied security measures , offers the community or the state - as far as any of the two parties are concerned - every reasonable opportunity to give the Council the necessary security . &quot;
&quot; on request of the organization , community or state you will find consultations on questions arising from the interpretation or application of this agreement . &quot;
the Community and States are entitled to seek out that questions arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention may be examined by the Council .
the Council invites the Community and the State concerned to participate in the discussion of such questions by the Council .
&quot; any dispute arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention shall be lod@@ ged with the exception of any dispute arising from the interpretation or application of this Convention and which are not included in the negotiation process or any other procedure agreed by the Organization , Community and States , which consists of five arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the Community and States appoint two arbitr@@ ators , the organization also ren@@ oun@@ ces two arbitr@@ ators , and the four arbitr@@ ators appoint a fifth who pres@@ ides over the pres@@ idency . &quot;
&quot; if the Community and States or the Organization shall not nom@@ inate two arbitr@@ ators within thirty days of the application for arbit@@ ration , the Community or the Organisation may request the President of the International Court of Justice to appoint the arbitr@@ ator . &quot;
&quot; the same procedure is applicable , if within thirty days following the appointment or appointment of the fourth arbitr@@ ator the fifth arbitr@@ ator has not yet been elected . &quot;
&quot; a majority of the members of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are competent , and all decisions require the consent of at least three arbitr@@ ators . &quot;
&quot; the decisions of the Ar@@ bit@@ ral Tribunal are binding for the organisation , the community and the States concerned . &quot;
&quot; ( a ) This Agreement shall apply to non @-@ nuclear weapons , the contracting party of the Treaty and become members of the Community ( in force , i ) if the relevant state of the organization noti@@ fies that its procedures are concluded for the entry into force of this Convention and &quot;
( II ) if the association noti@@ fies that it is able to apply its security measures concerning this state for the purposes of this Convention .
&quot; a ) The Organisation , the Community and the States consult each other on request of one of the contracting Parties to am@@ ending this agreement . &quot;
&quot; B ) Any amendments require the consent of the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
C ) The General Director shall immediately inform all Member States of the Organization from any change in the Convention .
this Convention enters into force on the day the organization of the Community and States receives the written notification that its procedures for entry into force are completed .
B ) This Agreement shall remain in force as long as the states of the contracting party are the contracting party of the contract .
&quot; the term &quot; &quot; agreement &quot; &quot; used in this agreement means the agreement and the protocol . &quot;
the purpose of this part of the Convention is to stipul@@ ate the procedures applied in the implementation of the provisions of the Part I on securing measures .
&quot; the aim of the procedures laid down in this agreement is the timely discovery of the turno@@ ff of significant amounts of nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities for the manufacture of nuclear weapons and other core explosive devices for unknown purposes , as well as det@@ err@@ ence from such a junction by the risk of premature discovery . &quot;
&quot; for the enrich@@ ment of the target defined in Article 28 , the material book@@ keeping as a securing measure of fundamental importance , combined with the spatial enc@@ ro@@ achment and the observation as important supplementary measures , is used . &quot;
the technical conclusion of the investigations by the organization is carried out by an explanation in which the material quantity for each material balance zone is specified for a certain period of accuracy with indication of accuracy limits for the given measurements .
&quot; in carrying out their veri@@ fications , the organisation makes 3 full use of the community &apos;s security system . &quot;
the accounting and control system of the Community for Nuclear Material in accordance with this Convention is based on a breakdown in material balance zones .
&quot; in the application of their securing measures , the Community will make use of de procedures and measures of the following kind , and they , as far as necessary , fores@@ ee how they are near@@ er to the supplementary agreements and are expe@@ dient : &quot;
&quot; a ) a measuring system for determining the quantities of con@@ served , out@@ dated , lost , lost or otherwise removed from the hol@@ dings of distant core material and stock levels ; &quot;
B ) evaluating the re@@ produ@@ ci@@ bility and accuracy of measurements and ass@@ essing measurement uncertainty ;
&quot; C ) Proced@@ ure for determination , testing and evaluation of differences in the measurements of sender and recipient ; &quot;
e ) procedures for evaluating appropri@@ ations of non @-@ measured inventory and non @-@ measured losses ;
&quot; F ) a protocol and reporting system , which points out the core material inventory and the changes in this inventory , including the inputs and outputs of the material balance zone ; &quot;
( g ) provisions that ensure that accounting procedures and agreements are carried out correctly ;
h ) Proced@@ ure for reporting of reports to the organization in accordance with articles 59 to 65 and 67 to 69 .
the provisions of this Convention do not extend to material in mining or in ore preparation .
&quot; B ) ur@@ anium or material containing the phase of the nuclear fuel cycle described under the letter c ) will be introduced into States , so the association of organization shares the quantity and composition of the material , unless it is introduced for specific non @-@ nuclear purposes ; &quot;
&quot; C ) relies on core material that is suitable for fuel production or is@@ ot@@ ope enrich@@ ment , the system or process phase in which it is produced , or the core material or other , in a later phase of the nuclear fuel cycle established nuclear material in the states , so it is subject to the other securing measures mentioned in this Convention . &quot;
&quot; a ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention are termin@@ ated for core material under the conditions mentioned in Article 11 . however , the community considers that the recovery of nuclear material , which is subject to provisions in accordance with this Convention , is temporarily not possible or desirable from resi@@ dues , so consult the organization and the community over the use of suitable securing measures . &quot;
B ) The securing measures envis@@ aged in this Convention shall be termin@@ ated under the conditions mentioned in Article 13 unless the organization and the Community notice that this core material is virtually un@@ profitable .
&quot; on request of the Community , the organisation fre@@ es the following core material from the securing measures following this Convention : &quot;
a ) Partic@@ ularly fis@@ si@@ le material when used in grams or smaller quantities as a sensor in instruments ;
&quot; B ) Nuclear material , if it is used in non @-@ nuclear activities after article 13 , if such core material is rep@@ lic@@ able , and &quot;
C ) Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um with an is@@ ot@@ ope concentration of Pl@@ ut@@ oni@@ um @-@ 238 which is over 80 % .
&quot; on request of the Community , the organization fre@@ es core material , which would otherwise be subject to securing measures under this Convention , from these security measures , provided the entire material quantity delivered in the states is at no time more than &quot;
a ) a total of one kil@@ ogram of special fol@@ dable material that can consist of one or more of the following materials :
&quot; II ) Ur@@ anium with a enrich@@ ment of 0,2 ( 20 % ) and above , calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with enrich@@ ment , &quot;
III ) Ur@@ an with a forti@@ fication which lies below 0.2 ( 20 % ) and above the natural ur@@ anium is calculated by multip@@ lication of its weight with the five @-@ fold squar@@ ed of enrich@@ ment ;
B ) a total of ten metric tons of natural ur@@ anium and de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with enrich@@ ment of more than 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) ;
C ) 20 metric tons de@@ pl@@ eted ur@@ anium with a forti@@ fication of 0.00@@ 5 ( 0.5 % ) or below ;
&quot; if the fre@@ eing core material is to be processed , processed or stored together with core material that is subject to the securing measures under this Convention , precau@@ tions are taken for the re@@ use of the securing measures on that material . &quot;
&quot; the community meets with the organization of supplementary agreements , which are necessary in the scope , which is required for the successful and eff@@ ec@@ tual accompl@@ ishment of the tasks of the organization in accordance with this Convention , in the individual as to how the procedures laid down in the Convention are applicable . &quot;
the supplementary agreements can be extended or amended without alter@@ ation of this agreement in the agreement between the organization and the community .
&quot; the remaining agreements occur simultaneously with or as soon as possible after the entry into force of this agreement into force . the organization , the community and the states undertake every effort to make these agreements within nin@@ ety days after the entry into force of this Convention ; an extension of this period requires a reci@@ pro@@ cal action between the organization , the community and the states . &quot;
&quot; on the basis of the initial report named in Article 62 , the organization provides a consolidated inventory of the entire core material in the states , irrespective of its origin , and carries on this inventory as a result of the reports below and the results of their review . &quot;
&quot; between the European Economic Community ( E@@ EC ) and their member states Belgium , Denmark , Germany , France , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , the United Kingdom ( Member States ) on the one hand and the International Development Organisation ( Organisation ) &quot;
GR@@ Ü@@ N@@ DE - a ) The E@@ EC has decided to contribute to the special action programme established at the Conference for International Economic Cooperation in order to help meet the immediate needs of individual countries with low in@@ comes whose development is hin@@ dered by general drug @-@ cent@@ ran@@ sm@@ s problems .
&quot; C ) It is the objective of the E@@ EC and the Member States that the entire contribution made by the Member States is bound within six months of entry into force of the agreement , and the organization will do its utmost to achieve this goal . &quot;
&quot; d ) The E@@ EC and the Organisation have consul@@ ted each other about the proposed implementation and management of this agreement and the central bonds , in order to ensure a broad and balanced geographical distribution within the framework of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; to this end , the organisation of the E@@ EC has presented a table , which is evident in what way it intends to apply the criteria specified in this agreement - &quot;
&quot; the organization direc@@ ts a special account under the name &quot; &quot; Special Ac@@ tions Account &quot; &quot; which consists of the funds that the Member States contribute to the Special Investment Account ; this account is defined by the Organization as a trust@@ ee and used ( in this capacity , the organization is referred to as &quot; administrator &quot; ) , and is only to the purpose defined in this agreement and in accordance with the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
the Special Investment Account will be seg@@ reg@@ ated separately from all other accounts and assets of the organization .
&quot; the contributions are to be paid as follows : a ) Payment shall be made in the form of cash or in@@ sensitive deb@@ tors of the member state , which are to be paid on demand in the currency of the respective state at order of the organization as car@@ et@@ aker of the Special Operations account and to deposit at the institution of the organization in the country concerned . &quot;
&quot; B ) The payment is made in two install@@ ments , and i ) the first amoun@@ ting to at least 45 v . h . the contribution within 30 days of entry into force of this agreement or to another between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker agreed time ; &quot;
&quot; II ) the second in the amount of the contribution of the contribution to 1 January 1979 or at another time , which was agreed upon between the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ aker taking into account the dead@@ lines required for the parliamentary approval of the annual budget . &quot;
C ) E@@ ach Member State may be able to make payments before the above @-@ mentioned dates .
&quot; in accordance with the usual procedures of the organization , the car@@ et@@ aker takes about proportional drawings on the cash or the school che@@ que in order to cover expenses for the Special Investment Lo@@ ans and compens@@ ate for the Special Investment Account in a reasonable manner . &quot;
&quot; in the gran@@ ting of these loans , the car@@ et@@ aker can be guided by the following factors in accordance with the conditions of the E@@ EC : &quot;
the extent to which international economic factors contributed to the country &apos;s current and fores@@ ee@@ able economic problems ;
VI ) of the composition and tendency of the country &apos;s debt service and its additional credit absorption capacity to loan terms with no benefit ; and
VII ) the extent to which the problems of the countries in question are regulated by contributions from other sources .
&quot; each special transaction loan serves to finance a clearly defined and rapidly pay@@ able development programme or project ( including a sec@@ toral stock ) , regardless of whether it is part of the organisation &apos;s loan program or not , according to the procedures and practices used for the purposes of the organization funded by the organization , the purpose of this agreement is to be taken into account . &quot;
&quot; the funds of the special transaction must not be used instead of ordinary funds from the International Bank for Recon@@ struction and Development ( Bank ) or the Organization , which has already been approved by the directors of the Bank or the Organization on the day of the entry into force of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; apart from section 4 , special rep@@ ay@@ ments are subject to the same rep@@ ay@@ ment conditions valid for the organisation granted by the organization ; thus , in ten free years , they are ref@@ und@@ able in 50 years . &quot;
&quot; speci@@ alization loans are granted in one or more currencies of the Member States , and are ref@@ und@@ able in these currencies . &quot;
amounts for payment of this fee are to be paid directly to the organization it re@@ tains .
&quot; each special loan is issued by a separate loan agreement between the recipient country and the car@@ et@@ aker , in which the origin of the means is given . &quot;
&quot; the revenue from any special transaction loan can be used for expenses in the currency of the recipient country or for goods or services ( which are made res@@ p . ) in a Member State ; ii ) in developing countries , which are members of the organization and that may be appointed by the administrator at the time of loan granted , recei@@ vers of a special transaction loan . &quot;
&quot; capital rep@@ ay@@ ments of special transactions are transferred to the special transaction account , and the amount paid in this manner in the currency of a member state is to be with@@ drawn from the car@@ et@@ aker to the Member State in question as soon as possible . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker has instruc@@ ted the E@@ EC on the plans and programmes approved by the directors for the complete assignment of all the Special Operations Speci@@ als to the E@@ EC , and through the plans and programs approved by the directors . &quot;
&quot; during the time of the payout of the Special Ac@@ tual Lo@@ an , the car@@ et@@ aker will inform the E@@ EC quar@@ terly about the development of the Special Rules and the expenses incurred . &quot;
the administrator transfers the E@@ EC as soon as possible after closing the financial year of the organization a detailed account of the special transaction account with an opinion of the external audit audi@@ tor of the organization to this account .
&quot; after full payment of the special transaction loan , the cust@@ odi@@ an of the E@@ EC will forward as soon as possible a detailed report on the plans and programs financed by the Special Economic Account . &quot;
&quot; the car@@ et@@ aker creates and carries out appropriate records and accounts , from which the contributions to the special asset account , the amounts paid to the account and from the account depos@@ ited from the account and the deposits paid to the Member States are obvious . &quot;
the E@@ EC and the car@@ et@@ akers work closely together to achieve the objectives of this agreement .
&quot; to this end , the E@@ EC ( represented by the Commission of the European Communities ) and the car@@ et@@ aker up to the full issue of the funds of the Special Trade Account from time to time will lead to an exchange of ideas on the status of the Special Trade Account , the progress of programmes or projects financed by special actions and all other questions concerning the provisions of this agreement . &quot;
&quot; if this agreement is not entered into force on 31 December 1978 or at a later date , the E@@ EC and the organisation may not be entered into force , the agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties with immediate effect are invalid . &quot;
&quot; if the total capital amount is rep@@ aid in accordance with Article II Section 8 of this Agreement and rep@@ aid to Member States , this agreement and all the resulting obligations of the parties are termin@@ ated with immediate effect . &quot;
this agreement requires the approval of the individual Member States and the E@@ EC in accordance with the proced@@ ural provisions of each party .
the governments of the Member States notice the Council of the European Communities the conclusion that they are concerned .
the General Sec@@ retariat shall pass on these noti@@ fications together with a Noti@@ fication on the proper approval of this Agreement by the E@@ EC to the Organisation .
this agreement becomes effective and enters into force on the first day of the month following the day of receipt of the above noti@@ fications in the organization .
&quot; this agreement is dra@@ fted in two manus@@ cri@@ pts in Danish , German , English , French , Italian and Dutch language , whereby each wor@@ ding is equally binding . &quot;
considering that the agreement is to be concluded in the form of a change to change the Anne@@ x A of the Protocol No. 1 to the agreement between the European Economic Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation ( 1 ) - H@@ AT F@@ OL@@ GEN@@ DI VER@@ OR@@ DER FIR@@ ST :
between the European Atom@@ ic Energy Community and the Swiss Con@@ federation in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics
&quot; the EURO@@ PE@@ AN nuclear community , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom , &quot; represented by the Commission of the European Communities , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Commission , &quot; &quot;
&quot; the Swiss Con@@ federation , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Switzerland , &quot; represented by the Swiss Federal Council , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Bundes@@ rat , &quot; &quot;
&quot; this program includes the creation of a large test facility , the J@@ ET project ( Joint European Tor@@ us ) , whose construction and operation of a common company in Chapter V of the Eur@@ atom Treaty - herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Joint Company J@@ ET . &quot; &quot;
&quot; for several years , Switzerland has been dealing with research in the area of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics and is well acquainted with the area in question . &quot;
&quot; because up to the practical use of controlled nuclear fusion , extensive work is carried out , it is in the interest of the contracting parties to summ@@ ari@@ ze their respective efforts in order to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps and to accelerate their respective research , which have a higher level of priority due to the energy crisis - &quot;
&quot; this agreement should enable any contracting party to avoid unnecessary over@@ laps due to a merger of their research efforts in the field of controlled nuclear fusion and plasma physics , as well as the common objective of this research , i.e. the cost @-@ wise competitive power generation by using the controlled nuclear fusion reaction , faster . &quot;
&quot; to achieve the objective of the present agreement , the parties associate their respective research programmes defined in Anne@@ x I and II of this agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Eur@@ atom programme &quot; and &quot; Swiss programme . &quot; &quot;
&quot; in order to guarantee effective cooperation , the Swiss programme will take over long @-@ term targets and the forms of cooperation of the Eur@@ atom programme ; it will be extended or amended by the institutions mentioned in Article 5 to 10 and article 16 of the present agreement , which may include new activities that are relevant for the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; each time the parties receive a new program , this will take place at the place of the program or the programs listed in App@@ endi@@ x I and II . &quot;
the association envis@@ aged in paragraph 1 is realised by : - adequate participation of any of the parties during the preparation and execution of the programs of the other party ;
&quot; - Exchange of personnel under relevant laboratories in the Eur@@ atom @-@ Member States , Switzerland and the Third Parties , with which Eur@@ atom has concluded a similar agreement as the present agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; associated third @-@ states , &quot; as well as the laboratories that participate in the Eur@@ atom programme ; &quot;
- mutual right to access to the scientific and technical results of the programs .
&quot; as part of the scope of the present agreement , Switzerland particip@@ ates in the J@@ ET project . &quot;
&quot; in view of the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of this Agreement , the Parties concluded an association agreement , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Association Agreement , &quot; which is as far as possible to those , herein@@ after referred to as &quot; Associ@@ ated Institu@@ tions , &quot; with regard to the realization of the Eur@@ atom programme . &quot;
&quot; with the same objective , Eur@@ atom is concerned that Switzerland is involved at the time of the entry into force of the present agreement on the promotion of human exchange , which is concluded between the Commission and the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s , herein@@ after called &quot; Agreement on Person@@ nel Exchange . &quot; &quot;
&quot; with regard to the participation in the J@@ ET project , Switzerland is part of the time of the entry into force of the present agreement to the Common Enterprise J@@ ET , whose constitution accepts them . &quot;
&quot; in addition , Eur@@ atom is responsible for the fact that Switzerland can become contracting partner of any contract whose objective is to be concluded in the framework of the present agreement , exemp@@ t association agreements or other similar contracts signed by Eur@@ atom during the validity of the present agreement . &quot;
the bodies entrusted with the implementation of the association envis@@ aged in Article 2 Section 1 of the agreement are described in Article 5 to 10 of this agreement and in the association agreement .
&quot; in particular , the Association Agreement should include the establishment of a steering committee , the competent representative of the Commission and the Bundes@@ rat . &quot;
- monitor the development of research and to enable the best possible results to be achieved in accordance with the objectives of this agreement .
Switzerland is represented by no more than two delegates in the connection group used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme - in the following &quot; V@@ G . &quot;
&quot; the V@@ G , which has to provide information exchange and cooperation in all questions concerning ongoing or planned programs and activities in the area of the Eur@@ atom programme , takes the task of all research and development activities to which this agreement relates . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it promotes the cooperation and coordination between the Associ@@ ated Organ@@ s and direc@@ ts its T * position in the interests of the two contracting parties on the common goal laid out in the Eur@@ atom programme and in the Swiss programme as well as the common goal laid down in Article 1 of the present agreement , and the scientific and technological developments in the world are du@@ ly considered . &quot;
&quot; pursuant to its Rules of Proced@@ ure , the V@@ G ap@@ points one or more Swiss representatives in the consulting groups created within the context of the Eur@@ atom programme , whenever the relevant Swiss authorities are looking for it . &quot;
&quot; the Advisory Group , which aims to emphas@@ ise the best possible scientific results for the Eur@@ atom programme , take this task as regards all research and development work to which is referred to in this agreement . &quot;
Switzerland is represented by the director of one of the laboratories involved in the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the committee &apos;s committee to monitor the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme and which is responsible for the capacity of the laboratories , which are involved in the work carried out within the framework of the program , grant this task with respect to all research and development work that fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; in particular , it provides the best possible use of the personnel and the exchange of the same between the laboratories involved in conducting the Eur@@ atom programme and the Swiss programme . &quot;
a Swiss representative is entitled to participate in the meetings of all the coordin@@ ating committees used within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme .
&quot; the coordination committees that provide appropriate proposals for the use of the resources , personnel and the knowledge and skills of the laboratories involved in the implementation of the Eur@@ atom programme have come true , which fall under the present agreement . &quot;
&quot; the BA@@ F belongs to the core and energy research representative of each Member State of Eur@@ atom , Switzerland and each affiliated third country . &quot;
&quot; on request of the Commission , the BA@@ F advis@@ es the Commission with regard to the implementation of the programme and possible changes in the al@@ ign@@ ments as well as in preparing the future programs and establishing its overall comprehensive , coordination and integration of national activities on community level in the field of fusion . &quot;
&quot; the opinions of the BA@@ F , the V@@ G , the Board of Directors , the Advisory Group and the Co@@ ordination Committ@@ ees have a consult@@ ative character . &quot;

the representatives of the two contracting parties work on the work of all technically advisory committees or all administrative bodies that are created for the purposes of the present agreement .
&quot; according to this agreement , Switzerland &apos;s financial contribution to this agreement is set on an amount each year , which is linked to the Eur@@ atom programme at the cost of the Eur@@ atom programme in the same proportion as the gross domestic product of Eur@@ atom and Switzerland in the previous year . &quot;
&quot; regarding the J@@ ET project , this financial contribution refers to the participation of Eur@@ atom on the common company as soon as it is established . &quot;
&quot; moreover , Switzerland has an amount committed to the Joint Venture company J@@ ET , which is defined in accordance with the rules of the statutes of this common company . &quot;
&quot; the financial contribution , which Eur@@ atom contributes to the financing of the work within the association agreement and the agreement on human resources exchange , is calculated on the same basis that is usually used to calculate the Eur@@ atom contributions to the financing of the works , which are carried out due to the relevant contracts . &quot;
the Commission shall inform the Federal Council at the beginning of the year on which amount will be allocated to cover expenses within the framework of the Eur@@ atom programme for the year concerned .
the Federal Council pays the amount due to this article as follows : 7 / 12 before 15 January and 5 / 12 before the 15th .
the remaining payment mod@@ alities for the financial contributions of Switzerland and Eur@@ atom in accordance with this article are set in Anne@@ x III to the present agreement .

the BIS could close Stand@@ by loan agreements with the central banks of credi@@ tor countries when banks offer an appropriate application .
&quot; the agreement could be closed up to the total amount of the contribution depos@@ ited by the credi@@ tor country , within a total limit of 2.@@ 7@@ 25 billion invo@@ ices ; this corresponds to 50 % of all future development funds of the member countries . &quot;
&quot; however , some terms are already mentioned below , for whose application the BIS would be ready . &quot;
&quot; at each stand @-@ by credit , the BIS would initially assume an obligation for two years , with the possibility of renew@@ als , but without a total of five years . &quot;
&quot; at the opening of the loans , as well as with its monetary renewal , the BIS would calculate a loan opening . &quot;
&quot; in addition , it would be agreed that the first dra@@ fts will not be made before the end of a month following the Stand@@ by Agreement , so that the Bank can make the necessary adjustments to its own liquidity . &quot;
&quot; the draw would take place in the currencies available in the BI@@ Z , most likely in US dollars ; they would extend to periods taking account of the funds of the bank , presum@@ ably three or six months . &quot;
&quot; the conditions would correspond to those who employ the BIS at the respective time under similar conditions , i.e. interest rates would largely correspond to the market rates . &quot;
&quot; however , if the BIS must obtain the necessary funds themselves on the market , then the interest rate applied to the application could reach a maximum that corresponds to a corresponding margin increased Li@@ bor . &quot;
I would be grateful if you would send me the consent of the Council of the European Communities .

&quot; recogni@@ zing that the states are the prot@@ ectors of the mig@@ rat@@ ory species of animals and must be , living in their national jurisdiction , or tra@@ verse it ; &quot;
&quot; in the conviction that conservation and effective le@@ ge and exploitation of mig@@ rat@@ ory animal species require joint actions of all states , in whose national jurisdiction these types spend part of their life cycle ; &quot;

&quot; 2 . the spread @-@ area of the wander@@ ing way is neither sharply reduced nor seen in the long term , in the future , to be restricted in future ; &quot;
&quot; 3. both present and in the fores@@ ee@@ able future , sufficient habitat is available to preserve the population of the wander@@ ing species in the long term and &quot;
&quot; 4 . the dis@@ semination and population @-@ size of the wander@@ ing nature reach the historical conditions of expansion and extent in a mass , in which potentially suitable ecos@@ ystems are present and this is compatible with a sensible hurry and use ; &quot;

in the form of a correspondence between the European Economic Community and the Argent@@ ine Republic on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el and lamb
&quot; I ad@@ ore , on the recent negotiations between our deleg@@ ations to establish provisions on the import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat from Argentina to the European Economic Community in connection with the application of the common market organisation for sheep and goat meat through the commun@@ ion . in the course of these negotiations the two parties proceed as follows : &quot;
- fresh or cooled hammer - lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ;
&quot; within the framework of this agreement , the export potential for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat from Argentina is set to the following annual amount : 20,000 tons , expressed in slaughter body weight ( 1 ) . &quot;
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , Argentina is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the actual quantity was not exceeding the agreed quantity and executed according to traditional offer forms ( frozen or cooled ) . &quot;
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties of this agreement consult each other before the introduction of such a change in the Committee mentioned under number 10 in order to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community accepts the protective clause , it oblig@@ ates itself to ensure that the access to Argentina &apos;s regulated access to the Community market is not affected . &quot;
&quot; in the event that imports from Argentina in one year exceed the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from Argentina for the rest of the year . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to limit the exhaus@@ tion on imports of products made by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st sentence of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; upon entering new Member States , the Community in consultation with Argentina will change the amount specified under number 2 according to the extent of Argent@@ inian trade with each new Member State . &quot;
the import charges for these new member states are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this is borne by the Ho@@ ech@@ st sentence of the exhaus@@ tion .
&quot; the total amount stated under number 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the Community to 23@@ ,000 tons of slaughter body weight . &quot;
&quot; the Community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could interfere with the marketing of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions so that the sale of frozen meat on frozen meat is not under@@ mining the sales of Argent@@ ine@@ an h@@ amm@@ el and lamb . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of funds or other promotion measures for the export of amm@@ el and lamb , as well as for slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , is only given at prices and conditions , which comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; these terms shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with Article XVI of the G@@ AT@@ T and in particular Article 10 paragraph 2 ( c ) of the Convention for the interpretation and application of Article VI , XVI and XX@@ III of the General Cust@@ oms and Trade Agreement . &quot;
&quot; Argentina warran@@ ts adher@@ ence to this agreement , in particular , in order to obtain export licenses for the quantities specified in this agreement for the products mentioned in this agreement . &quot;
&quot; the community ple@@ dges to meet all necessary precau@@ tions for the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products , based in Argentina on the presentation of a export licence , issued by the competent authority designated by the Argent@@ inian government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system are determined in such a way that the provision of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the question@@ able products can be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in addition , the competent Argent@@ ine@@ an authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals is determined to en@@ code the quantities for export licenses . &quot;
the committee is concerned that the agreement is properly applied and functioning smoothly .
&quot; he regularly reviews the tendency of the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and the meat market of both parties and on the global market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions specified for the purpose mentioned under number 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall ensure that the proper application of this Agreement will not be imp@@ aired by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb and goat meat are carried out under the agreement of not mentioned bar@@ gaining numbers after the community . &quot;
the Committee shall discuss all questions arising in the implementation of this Agreement and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities .
the provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by the rights and obligations of the parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount stated under number 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December .
&quot; the amount paid by the entry into force of this agreement until 1 January of the following year is determined in relation to the total annual amount , and bears the seasonal character of trade . &quot;
&quot; this agreement applies to the areas where the Treaty is applied for the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand , on the one hand and for the territory of the Republic of Argentina on the other . &quot;
&quot; it is valid until 31 March 1984 . at this time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any party to termin@@ ate it in writing with a period of one year . &quot;
&quot; in any case , the provisions of this Agreement shall be verified by the two parties before 1 April 1984 with regard to changes that they considered necessary for necessary . &quot;

&quot; with an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand on the trade with H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat &quot;
&quot; I honor the negotiations between our two deleg@@ ations to define rules on import of H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat from New Zealand to the Community in conjunction with the application of the Regulation on a Common Market Organisation for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat . &quot;
&quot; in recognition of the fact that the sheep @-@ economy and the export of amm@@ el and lamb in the world market , and especially after the community for the New Zealand economy , must be ensured and that the normal passage of the New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and lamb on these markets is not affected , I ad@@ ore the following agreement : &quot;
&quot; the agreement applies to : - fresh or cooled hammer - , lamb - and goat meat ( 02.@@ 01 A IV a ) ) ; &quot;
&quot; according to this agreement , New Zealand is ensured for H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat of access to the market of the Community in the amount specified in the agreement . &quot;
new Zealand receives assurance that the normal sales of his hammer and lamb is not affected by the application of the regulation .
&quot; in order to ensure proper functioning of the agreement , New Zealand is oblig@@ ated to ensure that the set @-@ up quantity does not exceed the set amount . &quot;
the pre @-@ set quantities are performed in traditional offers ( frozen or cooled ) .
the community ass@@ ures that New Zealand should not be prevented from using new technological developments or to maintain its competitive position in the community .
&quot; should a change in the offer form be possible due to changes in technology and trade , the two parties consult each other before the introduction of such a change in clause 10 mentioned in clause 10 to find an appropriate solution . &quot;
&quot; in the event that the community accepts the protective clause , it oblig@@ ates itself to protect the interests of New Zealand based on this agreement . &quot;
&quot; in case the imports from New Zealand are exceeding the agreed quantities , the Community reserves the right to susp@@ end imports from this country . &quot;
the community comm@@ its itself to restrict the exhaus@@ tion of imports from the products collected by this agreement to a Ho@@ ech@@ st sentence of 10 b.@@ H . ad val@@ or@@ em .
&quot; on the accession of new Member States , the Community in consultation with New Zealand will change the quantities given in clause 2 according to the scope of New Zealand trading with each new Member State . &quot;
the import charges for these new Member States are determined in accordance with the provisions of the Treaty of Acc@@ ession ; this will be borne by the Ho@@ ech@@ st sentence of the Ex@@ haus@@ tion clause in clause 5 .
&quot; the total volume stated in clause 2 is determined by the day of the accession of Greece to the 1,@@ 245 500 tons of slaughter body weight . &quot;
&quot; the Community under@@ takes everything to avoid market development , which could interfere with ordinary sales of New Zealand H@@ amm@@ el and Lamm@@ ers on the common market within the agreed quantities . &quot;
&quot; in particular , the Community meets precau@@ tions so that the sale of frozen meat on frozen meat is not under@@ mining due to the execution of the regulation . &quot;
&quot; in addition , the two contracting parties undertake everything to promote the consumption of meat in the community without danger to market stability . &quot;
&quot; taking into account the objectives and provisions of this agreement , the Community agrees that any actual use of reimbur@@ s@@ ements or other promotion measures for the export of amm@@ el and lamb , as well as for slaughter of certain living sheep and lam@@ bs , is only at prices and conditions that comply with the existing international obligations and take into account the traditional share of the community on world trade with these products . &quot;
&quot; new Zealand ensures compliance with the quantities stated in clause 2 , in particular that there are no export lic@@ ences beyond these quantities . &quot;
&quot; the community ple@@ dges to meet all necessary precau@@ tions , in order for the issu@@ ance of import licenses for the aforementioned products with origin in New Zealand based on the submission of a export licence , which is given by the competent authority appointed by the New Zealand government . &quot;
the details for the application of this system are determined in such a way that the provision of a deposit for the issu@@ ance of the import license for the question@@ able products can be wai@@ ved .
&quot; in terms of execution , the competent New Zealand authority of the competent authority of the Community in regular intervals is informed of the quantities for which export licenses have been issued ; these details may be imposed on the country of identification . &quot;
the committee is concerned that the agreement is properly applied and functioning smoothly .
&quot; the Committee regularly reviews the tendency on the H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and the meat market of the two parties and on the world market as well as the sales conditions on these markets , including the conditions specified for the purpose mentioned in clause 7 . &quot;
&quot; the Committee is concerned that the proper application of the Agreement will not be imp@@ aired by the fact that products from H@@ amm@@ el , lamb - and goat meat under the agreement are not executed according to the Community . &quot;
&quot; the Committee shall discuss all questions that arise concerning the implementation of the Agreement , which are presented to him by a contracting party , and recommends appropriate solutions to the competent authorities . &quot;
the provisions of this Agreement shall be governed by the rights and obligations of the contracting parties within the framework of the G@@ AT@@ T .
the annual amount set in clause 2 is valid for the period from 1 January to 31 December . the amount of the amount paid by the entry into force of this agreement is determined in proportion to the total annual volume .
&quot; this agreement applies to the territories in which the Treaty is applied to the establishment of the European Economic Community , and on the one hand , on the one hand and for the main area of New Zealand on the other . &quot;
&quot; this agreement entered into force on 20 October 1980 . it is valid until 31 March 1984 . at this time , it remains in force , subject to the right of any contracting party to termin@@ ate it with a period of one year . in any case , the provisions of this agreement are verified by both parties prior to 1 April 1984 . &quot;
&quot; if your government can agree to the preceding , this letter and your reply will form an agreement between the European Economic Community and New Zealand in this area . &quot;

&quot; binding spokes@@ person of this Protocol , whose English , French and Russian wor@@ ding is binding , is depos@@ ited with the Secretary @-@ General of the United Nations . &quot;
&quot; containers and inf@@ usion sets are to be provided with a label , written in English and French , which corresponds to the samples contained in the systems 2 to 10 of this protocol . &quot;
human whole blood must only be sent in containers where the temperature can be kept to 4 C to 6 C during transport .
&quot; the preparations and equipment mentioned in Part II of this protocol must be sterile , ap@@ y@@ ro@@ genic and non @-@ toxic . &quot;
&quot; it is recommended to add the devices necessary for the inf@@ usion , as well as the solvent for dry preparations . &quot;
human whole blood is taken away by a healthy person and mixed with a suitable antibody .
&quot; C ) which are not free of diseases transmitted by blood trans@@ f@@ usions , as far as this can be ensured through simple medical examination and medical history . &quot;
&quot; blood withdrawal is as@@ ep@@ tic ; the blood is sli@@ pped into a sterile bottle through a closed , sterile tube system , in which the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution was introduced before steri@@ li@@ zation . &quot;
&quot; after the removal of the blood , the bottle is immediately shut down and cooled to a temperature of 4 C to 6 C . afterwards , it must be opened immediately prior to the use of the blood . &quot;
&quot; quantit@@ atively , the anti@@ co@@ ag@@ ulation solution must not exceed 220 ml per liter of human whole blood , and the hem@@ og@@ lob@@ in concentration may not fall 97 g per liter . &quot;
the blood group according to the A @-@ B @-@ 0 system must first be determined by hand of the blood cells and the ser@@ um ; the determination of the R@@ h factor is carried out by examining the blood cells at a new sample of the don@@ or blood .
&quot; if there are standardized or recommended procedures for blood type determination in individual countries , these are applicable . &quot;
&quot; the designation R@@ h @-@ negative is only to be used if specific investigations have yiel@@ ded the absence of anti@@ gens C , D , Du and E. &quot;
the blood exchanged after this Convention shall be used only for recei@@ vers of the corresponding AB @-@ 0 group .
&quot; the human whole blood is protected in sterile , sealed bottle against micro@@ organisms and to hold it until its use at a temperature of 4 to 6 C ; higher temperatures are permitted only during the time required for testing and transport , which can exceed 30 minutes at most , wher@@ eup@@ on the blood can immediately be cooled to 4 to 6 C . &quot;
a concentrate of human red blood cells is a unit of human whole blood from which the largest part of the plasma has been removed .
it contains all red blood cells of the unit from which it has been won ; other blood cell components may be present or may have been partially removed .
&quot; the liquid content of the concentrate consists either of the rest of the plasma , or from a suitable is@@ ot@@ onic artificial water @-@ based solution , which was added after removal of the plasma . &quot;
&quot; the volume of the red blood cells is to be between 65 and 75 % of the total volume of the product ; however , a higher concentration of red blood cells is used , so the approxim@@ ate percentage of the ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te volume ( hem@@ at@@ oc@@ yst ) is indicated on the label . &quot;
&quot; all processes required for manufacturing must take place under as@@ ep@@ tic conditions . the filling must be carried out using a sterile , closed system and exclusively by pressure . &quot;
&quot; an artificial wat@@ ery solution has been added , so it is also possible to indicate their volume and composition on the label . &quot;
human dry plasma is obtained by drying out the liquid that is depos@@ ited at the top of centri@@ fu@@ g@@ ation or sedi@@ mentation of human blood .
human dry plasma is obtained by cold drying or any other method by which a den@@ atur@@ ation of proteins is avoided .
&quot; the dry product can easily be dissolved in a quantity of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid used in the production of the substance . &quot;
the protein concentration of the solution won is not less than 45 grams per litre and the solution must not show visible signs of hem@@ oly@@ sis .
donations in which ( using a fresh sample ) a dangerous content of in@@ soles or immune hem@@ o@@ quin@@ ol@@ in@@ ine have been determined are excluded .
&quot; if the plasma is not bl@@ ended and frozen within 48 hours of blood sampling , the ster@@ ility of each unit must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; to turn off the harmful effect of bacteria growth in plasma , blood donations , which exhibit a bacterial contamination , will not be used ; the ster@@ ility of each donation must be detected in a blood quantity of at least 10 ml . &quot;
&quot; in order to reduce the risk of transmission of in@@ ic@@ ul@@ ation@@ sh@@ ep@@ st@@ atitis , there are mix@@ tures that do not contain more than 12 donations , or apply other methods that are well known to reduce this risk in a comparable way . &quot;
&quot; one of the liquid quantity required for the production of the plasma is to add the amount of water , the substance must be completely dissolved within 10 minutes at 15 to 20 C . &quot;
&quot; a given quantum plasma is dissolved in the amount of water , which corresponds to the amount of liquid that it has been produced ; the solution is subjected to the following tests : &quot;
&quot; the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ kil@@ n at 37 C . however , the process can be accelerated in the brood @-@ kil@@ n at 37 C . &quot;
&quot; due to the 24 @-@ hour drying process in the presence of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des under a pressure of at most 0.@@ 02 mm mer@@ cury , weight loss cannot occur in the human dry plasma loss of weight over 0.5 % . &quot;
&quot; human dry plasma is stored in a nitrogen @-@ atmosphere or in an air @-@ empty space in a sterile , sealed bottle , under exclusion of any micro @-@ organisms and the possibility of storing any moisture ; it is protected from light and to hold on a temperature below 20 C . &quot;
human alb@@ um@@ in and fr@@ actions from human plasma protein are preparations from the protein component from which about 60 % of the total proteins of the plasma of human whole blood exist .
&quot; regardless of whether the final product should be p@@ essi@@ vely or dry , the preparation must be heated to 60 C ± 0.5 C after an appropriate stabili@@ zer in the final container for 10 hours to in@@ activate the path@@ ogen of the I@@ no@@ cul@@ ation hepatitis . &quot;
in preparations from human alb@@ um@@ in at least 95 % of the mass of the available proteins must be alb@@ um@@ in .
in both preparations no more than 10 mg immun@@ og@@ lob@@ ulin G per gram of the product may be present .
&quot; if the end product is freeze @-@ dried , it must contain at least 950 mg of protein per gram of the product . &quot;
&quot; if the fraction is made from human plasma protein as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration between 45 and 50 g per liter . &quot;
&quot; if human alb@@ um@@ in is produced as a solution , it must have a total protein concentration of at least 45 grams per liter . &quot;
&quot; comparison measurements of vis@@ cosity and clou@@ d@@ iness as well as centri@@ fu@@ ge with the ultra@@ centri@@ fu@@ ge and electro@@ phor@@ esis , which are made before and after heating to the solutions , must not show signs of den@@ atur@@ ation of dissolved proteins . &quot;

&quot; whereas for the Member States of the European Economic Community , the obligation to grant this release falls into the competence of the community , which according to the contract by which it has been established , has the requ@@ is@@ ite powers ; &quot;
considering that it is necessary for the implementation of Article 5 paragraph 1 of the Convention that the European Economic Community may be the contracting party of the Convention -
the Convention enters into force for the Community on the first day of the month following the signature .
&quot; on the first day of the month , it enters into force that follows the day when the last of the parties has depos@@ ited their certificate of acceptance at the Secretary General of the Council of Europe . &quot;
&quot; ( 2 ) An additional protocol , however , occurs after two years after the date in force , to which it has been imposed for acceptance unless one of the contracting parties has notified the objection to its entry into force . &quot;
&quot; from that point on , a state cannot be the contracting party of the Convention without becoming the same party of the Additional Protocol . &quot;
&quot; the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Member States of the Council of Europe , the States and the European Economic Community every acceptance or objection in the sense of Article 2 as well as the time of the entry into force of this additional protocol under Article 2 . &quot;
&quot; according to the General Secretary , the European Economic Community also noti@@ fies any action , notification or communication relating to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; whereas Member States need to support each other in the spirit of European solidarity in obtaining re@@ agents for blood group determination , &quot;
whereas this mutual support is only possible if the nature and use of these re@@ agents are subject to the regulation of blood group determination and to be granted the necessary facil@@ itation and exemp@@ tions for their import .
&quot; in the sense of this convention , the term &quot; re@@ agents for blood group determination &quot; means re@@ agents of human , animal , plant and other origin for blood type determination and determination of blood intoler@@ ances . &quot;
&quot; any contracting party may limit the application of this Convention to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe by a declaration directed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe by a declaration directed to the Secretary General of the Council of Europe . &quot;
the declaration can be with@@ drawn at any time by a notification addressed to the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .

each shipment of re@@ agents for blood type determination must be accompanied by a certificate made according to the regulations of the protocol .
the protocol and its system constitute an administrative agreement that can be amended or amended by the governments of the contracting parties .
the Parties shall take all necessary measures to free the re@@ agents provided by other contracting parties for the determination of blood group identification from all input donations .
&quot; they also meet all the necessary measures to ensure that these substances rapidly reach the recei@@ vers described in Article 3 , and in the shortest possible way . &quot;
the contracting parties communicate with each other via the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe a list of places available for issu@@ ance of the certificate envis@@ aged in Article 4 .
these positions should be identical with the places designated in Article 6 of the European Convention on the exchange of therapeutic substances of human origin .
&quot; this Convention is for the members of the Council of Europe for signing up ; they can be contracting party by signing it a ) without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , or &quot;
&quot; this agreement enters into force one month after the date , in which three members of the Council signed it under Article 7 without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval or rati@@ fied or approved . &quot;
&quot; for each member who signs or rati@@ fies or rati@@ fies this Agreement later without reservation of rati@@ fication or approval , it enters into force one month after its signature or leave the rati@@ fication or permit certificate . &quot;
&quot; following the entry into force of this Convention , the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe can invite any non @-@ member state to join the Convention . &quot;
the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe noti@@ fies the Council and the Member States a ) the time of entry into force of this Convention and the names of members signed or rati@@ fied by rati@@ fication or approval ;
any contracting party can termin@@ ate this agreement with respect to a period of one year by indicating the Secretary @-@ General of the Council of Europe .
&quot; a re@@ agent for blood type determination must react with all blood samples tested , containing the an@@ tigen that is hom@@ olo@@ g to the antibody or another on the label . &quot;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is used in the recommended way by the manufacturer , the following factors or phenomena may not occur : a ) h@@ amm@@ ol@@ tic properties ; &quot;
the ti@@ ter is measured by repeatedly dil@@ lution of the re@@ agent to double in a suitable medium .
the ti@@ ter is the reci@@ pro@@ cal value of the number of strongest ser@@ um di@@ lution in which a reaction occurs ; the di@@ lution is calculated exclusively of the volume of blood circulation in the overall volume .
&quot; for anti @-@ A , anti @-@ B or other re@@ agents used on object carriers , the activity is expressed through time that is required for ag@@ glut@@ ination on an object carrier . &quot;
&quot; the World Health Organization has set standards for anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B as well as complete anti @-@ D re@@ agents for blood group determination international standards , and for re@@ agents of other specific@@ ity are elabor@@ ated at the time . &quot;
&quot; according to definition , an international standard preparation contains a certain number of international units per mg or ml , and this definition is independent of the ti@@ ters observed in individual preparations of red blood cells ( 1 ) . &quot;
( 1 ) The effectiveness of the re@@ agents for the blood group determination of most speci@@ alities is expressed as ag@@ glut@@ in@@ ation@@ sti@@ te that is observed in a series of di@@ lu@@ tions in an ery@@ thro@@ cy@@ te in@@ undation .
the Tit@@ er announces the di@@ lution of the re@@ agent in the final mix within a series at which a micro@@ sc@@ opic visible ag@@ glut@@ ination occurs .
&quot; the effectiveness of re@@ agents for blood type determination , for which international standard preparations are present ( currently anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B and complete anti @-@ D ) , can be expressed on the basis of the ti@@ tr@@ ation of the unknown re@@ agent in international units ( see Bulletin WHO O@@ MS 1954 , 10 , 9@@ 37 , 9@@ 41 - 1950 , 3 , 301 ) . &quot;
&quot; if you bring it back to a volume of 1 ml , so contain the anti @-@ A and anti @-@ B sc@@ iss@@ ors according to definition 256 international units per ml . &quot;
&quot; the preparations are available free of charge from the International Labor@@ atorium on biological norms of the World Health Organization , Stat@@ ens Ser@@ um Institute , Copenhagen . &quot;
the following table shows an example of a comparative ti@@ tr@@ ation of the International standard ser@@ um Anti @-@ A ( S ) and an &quot; unknown &quot; anti @-@ A re@@ agent ( U ) against red blood cells A1 and red blood cells A@@ 2B . &gt; PI@@ C FI@@ LE = &quot; T@@ 00@@ 450@@ 83 &quot; &gt;
&quot; if a re@@ agent is stored under the recommended conditions recommended by the manufacturer , its required properties shall remain for at least one year . &quot;
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date of a re@@ agent in the form of the label rests at most one year after the last satisfactory efficacy test .
the exp@@ ir@@ ation date for dry re@@ agents based on the label depends on the results of the feasi@@ bility trials ; it is to be approved by the state regulatory authorities .
&quot; dry re@@ agents are stored in an atmosphere of in@@ ert gas or in a vacuum , in the glass container in which it has been dried and which is so closed that no moisture can penetrate . &quot;
a dry re@@ agent may lose at most 0.5 % of its weight if it is tested by further drying of phosph@@ or@@ pent@@ oxi@@ des at a pressure of no more than 0.@@ 02 mm Hg in 24 hours .
&quot; in order to avoid bacterial growth , the responsible government authority may determine that the re@@ agent ( or the solv@@ ents supplied with the dry re@@ agents ) is an anti@@ sep@@ tic and / or antibiotic , provided the re@@ agent with the added substance continues to provide the requirements for specific@@ ity and efficacy . &quot;
sera human origin for blood type determination must contain at least 2.5 mg of protein per ml of cur@@ essive or re @-@ dissolved ser@@ ums .
&quot; re@@ agents , whether in the form of cur@@ rant form or after re @-@ opening , must be transparent and may contain neither sedi@@ ments nor gels or visible particles . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents for the international exchange of blood group determination should not be arti@@ fici@@ ally colored , at least until an international agreement has come about a uniform system . &quot;
re@@ agents for blood type determination can be distributed in such a way that the re@@ agent contained in a container is not only sufficient to carry out tests with the unknown blood cells but also to perform tests with positive and negative control blood cells .
the amount contained in a container must be so large that the contents may be used to carry out the efficacy tests described in this protocol .
the manufacturing laboratory has written records on all stages of production and checks of re@@ agents for blood group determination .
&quot; reasonable specimens of all the re@@ agents have to be preserved so long from the laboratory , until some probability can be assumed that the batch is no longer used . &quot;
&quot; the re@@ agents used for blood type determination may contain substances of human , animal , plant ( or mineral ) origin ; some of these represent the effective part , the others are the necessary aids to enhance effectiveness and maintain stability of the re@@ agent . &quot;
&quot; for technical reasons , these re@@ agents are divided into three groups according to their effective response . &quot;
&quot; this does not mean that re@@ agents of human origin contain substances of human origin , or that animal or herbal re@@ agents cannot contain substances of human origin . &quot;
&quot; on each individual container , a black printed label is available in English and French , containing the following information : 1 . name and address of the manufacturer , &quot;
&quot; 4 . the amount or , in dried re@@ agents , the amount and composition of the liquid needed to restore the re@@ plen@@ ishment , &quot;

&quot; in DER Er@@ v@@ eg@@ ung , it is appropriate to simplify the simil@@ arities in goods traffic between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries , in particular by the introduction of a single management paper , &quot;
&quot; in DER Er@@ v@@ eg@@ ung , that this Convention may not be interpreted in order to un@@ tie the Parties from its obligations under other international agreements - &quot;
&quot; in this Convention , measures are set to simplify the simil@@ arities in goods traffic between the Community and EF@@ TA countries as well as between the individual EF@@ TA countries as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) for all export and import procedures as well as for a common shipping method ( herein@@ after referred to as shipping method ) . &quot;
&quot; the simil@@ arities associated with the goods traffic between the parties are authorised by a single paper , for the pre @-@ print@@ ings according to the patterns in Anne@@ x I to use to this Convention . &quot;
&quot; the unit paper serves as an application or paper for export , shipping or import@@ ation . &quot;
&quot; - for the implementation of legislation applicable in a contracting party , whose application would not be guaranteed by the sole use of the single paper ; &quot;
&quot; - to be required by the participants , so that they may apply to the enjoyment of an advantage or a certain relief . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) This Agreement does not hin@@ der the Parties to apply simplified procedures , including the use of data processing , with regard to further facil@@ itation for those involved . &quot;

( 2 ) The use of paragraph 1 shall not be linked to a special condition of the relevant authorities .
&quot; without prejudi@@ ce to the special provisions on collection con@@ sign@@ ments , the relevant authorities can see , however , that the prob@@ abilities for the export and the shipping method are based on one and the same pre @-@ pressure by means of the copies intended for these prob@@ abilities . &quot;
&quot; in the case of article 7 , the relevant authorities shall be satisfied as far as possible that the information contained in the copies of the application is contained in the copies of the application . &quot;
&quot; ( 1 ) To guarantee trouble @-@ free goods traffic between the contracting parties and to facilitate the disclosure of ir@@ regul@@ arities or contra@@ ventions , the customs authorities of these countries are looking for or - if they consider it of interest to another contracting party - from all available information ( including administrative reports ) . &quot;

( 3 ) The Comp@@ ens@@ ation Committee decides changes to the annex@@ es to this Convention as well as the Fac@@ il@@ ations mentioned in Article 4 paragraph 3 .
&quot; ( 4 ) If the representative of a contracting party in the mixed committee has accepted a decision under the reservation of the constitutional requirements , the decision , provided that there is no date , shall enter into force on the first day of the second month after notification of the cancellation of the reservation . &quot;
&quot; any contracting party shall take appropriate measures to ensure effective and balanced implementation of the Convention , with the need to take into account the obligations of goods transport as far as possible and to supply satisfactory solutions in the application of the provisions of this Convention . &quot;
